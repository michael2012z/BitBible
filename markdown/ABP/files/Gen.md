## Genesis 1

1.  The Creation In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.

2. But the earth was unseen and unready, and darkness was upon the abyss, and spirit of God bore upon the water.

3. And God said, Let there be light! And there was light.

4. And God beheld the light that it was good. And God parted between the light and between the darkness.

5. And God called the light, Day, and the darkness he called, Night; and there was evening and there was morning, day one.

6. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and let it be for parting between water and water!

7. And God made the firmament, and God parted between the water which was underneath the firmament, and between the water  above the firmament.

8. And God called the firmament, Heaven. And God beheld that it was good; and there was evening and there was morning, [2day 1the second].

9. And God said, Let [6come together 1the 2water  3underneath 4the 5heaven] into [2gathering 1one], and let [3appear 1the 2dry land]! And it was so. And [6gathered together 1the 2water  3underneath 4the 5heaven] into  their gatherings, and [3appeared 1the 2dry land].

10. And God called the dry land, Earth; and the collections of the waters he called, Seas. And God beheld that it was good.

11. And God said, Let [3grow 1the 2earth] pasturage of grass sowing seed according to type, and according to likeness, and [2tree 1the fruitful] producing fruit which the seed of it is in it, according to type upon the earth! And it was so.

12. And [3brought forth 1the 2earth] pasturage of grass sowing seed, according to type, and according to likeness; and [2tree 1the fruitful] producing fruit which the seed of it is in it, according to type upon the earth.

13. And God beheld that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, [2day 1the third].

14. And God said, Let there be luminaries in the firmament of the heaven for giving light upon the earth,  to part between the day and between the night! And let them be for signs, and for times, and for days, and for years!

15. And let them be for giving light in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth! And it was so.

16. And God made the two [2luminaries  1great]; the [2luminary  1greater] for beginnings of the day, and the [2luminary  1lesser] for beginnings of the night, and the stars.

17. And [2put 3them  1God] in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth,

18. and to begin the day and the night, and to part between the light and between the darkness. And God beheld that it was good.

19. And there was evening and there was morning, [2day 1the fourth].

20. And God said, Let [3bring forth 1the 2waters] reptiles [2lives 1of living], and [2winged creatures 1flying] upon the earth below the firmament of the heaven! And it was so.

21. And God made the [2whales  1great], and every life of living creatures of reptiles which [3brought forth 1the 2waters] according to their types; and every [2winged creature 1feathered] according to type. And God beheld that it was good.

22. And [2blessed 3them  1God], saying, Grow and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas! And [2the 3winged creatures 1let] be multiplied upon the earth!

23. And there was evening and there was morning, [2day 1the fifth].

24. And God said, Let [3bring forth 1the 2earth 5life 4living] according to its type -- four-footed, and reptiles, and wild beasts of the earth according to type! And it was so.

25. And God made the wild beasts of the earth according to type, and the cattle according to their type, and all the reptiles of the earth according to type. And God beheld that it was good.

26. And God said, Let us make man according to [2image 1our], and according to likeness! And let them control the fishes of the sea, and the winged creatures of the heaven, and the cattle, and all the earth, and all the reptiles of the ones crawling upon the earth!

27. And God made  man. According to the image of God he made him. Male and female he made them.

28. And [2blessed 3them  1God], saying, Grow and multiply, and fill the earth, and dominate it! And control the fishes of the sea, and the winged creatures of the heaven, and all the cattle, and all of the earth, and all of the reptiles of the ones crawling upon the earth!

29. And God said, Behold, I have given to you every grass fit for sowing a sowing of seed which is upon the earth, and every tree which has in itself a fruit seed fit for sowing; to you it will be for food,

30. and to all the wild beasts of the earth, and to all the winged creatures of the heaven, and to every reptile crawling upon the earth, which has in itself breath of life, even every [2grass 1green] for food. And it was so.

31. And God beheld  all as much as he made. And behold, it was [2good 1exceedingly]. And there was evening and there was morning, [2day 1the sixth].  

## Genesis 2

1.  Completion of Heaven and Earth And [6were completed 1the 2heaven 3and 4the 5earth], and all the cosmos of them.

2. And God completed in the [2day  1sixth]  his works which he did. And he rested on the [2day  1seventh] from all  his works which he did.

3. And God blessed the [2day  1seventh], and sanctified it; for in it he rested from all  his works -- which God began to do.

4. This is the book of the origin of heaven and earth, when it became, in the day [2made  1God] the heaven and the earth,

5. and every green field before  it existed upon the earth, and all grass of the field before  its rising, [4did not 1for 5rain 2the lord  3God] upon the earth, and [3man 2no 1there was] to work it.

6. But a spring ascended from out of the earth, and it watered all the face of the earth. 

7.  God Shapes Man And God shaped the man, [2dust 1taking] from the earth. And he breathed into  his face breath of life, and [2became  1man] a [2soul 1living].

8. And God planted paradise in Eden according to the east, and he put there the man whom he shaped.

9. And [2caused to rise up  1God] yet from the earth every [2tree 1beautiful] to the sight, and good for food, and the tree  of life in the midst of the paradise, and the tree, the one to know knowing good and evil.

10. And a river goes forth from Eden to water the paradise; from there it separates into four sources.

11. The name to the one is Phison. This is the one encircling all the land of Havilah -- [5there 1where 4is 2the 3gold].

12. And the gold  of that land is good, and there is the carbuncle and the [2stone  1leek colored].

13. And the name to the [2river  1second] is Gihon. This is the one encircling all the land of Ethiopia.

14. And the [2river  1third] is the Tigris. This is the one going forth over against the Assyrians. And the [2river  1fourth] is the Euphrates.

15. And [3took 1the lord  2God] the man whom he shaped, and put him in the paradise to work it and to guard.

16. And [3gave charge 1the lord  2God] to Adam, saying, From all of a tree of the one in the paradise [2food 1you shall eat],

17. but from the tree of the knowing good and evil, you shall not eat from it; but in whatever day you should eat from it, to death you shall die. 

18.  God Makes Woman And [3said 1the lord  2God], It is not good [3to be 1for the 2man] alone, let us make for him a helper according to him!

19. And God shaped yet from out of the earth all the wild beasts of the field, and all the winged creatures of the heaven. And he led them to  Adam, to behold what he would call them. And all what ever [2called 3it 1Adam] -- [2life 1the living], this was the name to it.

20. And Adam called names to all the cattle, and to all the winged creatures of the heaven, and to all the wild beasts of the field; but to Adam there was not found a helper likened to him.

21. And [3put 1the lord  2God] a change of state over  Adam, and he slept. And he took one  of his ribs, and supplied flesh against it.

22. And [3built 1the lord  2God] the rib which he took from  Adam into a woman. And he led her to  Adam.

23. And Adam said, This now is bone from  my bones, and flesh from  my flesh; she shall be called woman, for from the man she was taken.

24. Because of this [2shall leave 1man]  his father and  mother, and shall cleave to  his wife, and [3shall be 1the 2two] for [2flesh 1one].

25. And [3were 1the 2two] naked,  both Adam and  his wife. And they were not ashamed.  

## Genesis 3

1.  The Fall of Man But the serpent was most skilled of all the wild beasts, of the ones upon the earth whom [3made 1the lord  2God]. And [3said 1the 2serpent] to the woman, For why said  God, No way should you eat from all of a tree of the paradise?

2. And [3said 1the 2woman], From fruit of the tree of the paradise we shall eat;

3. but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the paradise, God said, Eat not from it, nor touch it! that you should not die.

4. And [3said 1the 2serpent] to the woman, Not to death will you die.

5. [3knows 1For  2God] that in which ever day you should eat of it, [3will be opened wide 1your  2eyes], and you will be as gods, knowing good and evil.

6. And [3beheld 1the 2woman] that [3is good 1the 2tree] for food, and that it is pleasing to the eyes to behold, and is beautiful  for contemplating. And having taken the fruit of it, she ate, and she gave also to her husband with her, and they ate.

7. And [5were opened wide 1the 2eyes 3of the 4two], and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed leaves of a fig-tree, and made to themselves loincloths.

8. And they heard the voice of the lord  God walking in the paradise  at dusk. And [5hid  1both 2Adam 3and  4his wife] from the face of the lord  God in the midst of the tree of the paradise.

9. And God called  Adam, and said to him, Adam, Where are you?

10. And he said to him,  [2your voice 1I heard] while walking in the paradise, and I feared, for I am naked, and I hid.

11. And [2said 3to him  1God], Who announced to you that you are naked, unless from the tree of which I gave charge to you, saying, This alone you are not to eat from it -- you ate.

12. And Adam said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave to me from the tree, and I ate.

13. And [3said 1the lord  2God] to the woman, What is this you did? And [3said 1the 2woman], The serpent deceived me, and I ate.

14. And [3said 1the lord  2God] to the serpent, Because you did this, accursed are you from all the cattle, and from all the wild beasts of the ones upon the earth. Upon  your breast and  belly you shall go, and earth you shall eat all the days  of your life.

15. And [2hatred 1I will put] between you and between the woman; and between  your seed and between  her seed. He will give heed to your head, and you will give heed to his heel.

16. And to the woman he said, In multiplying I will multiply  your distresses, and  your moanings. In distresses you will bear children, and to  your husband  your submission, and he will dominate you.

17. And to Adam he said, Because you hearkened to the voice  of your wife, and ate from the tree of which I gave charge to you, saying, This alone you are not to eat from it -- and you ate; accursed is the land among  your works; in distresses you will eat it all the days  of your life.

18. Thorn-bushes and thistles will rise to you, and you will eat the grass of the field.

19. By sweat  of your face you will eat  your bread, until the returning you into the earth from out of which you were taken. For earth you are and unto earth you will go.

20. And Adam called the name  of his wife, Zoe, for she was mother of all the living.

21. And [3made 1the lord  2God] to Adam and  his wife garments of skins, and he clothed them.

22. And God said, Behold, Adam has become as one of us,  to know good and evil. And now, lest at any time he might stretch out the hand, and should take from the tree  of life, and should eat, and will live into the eon --

23. that [3ejected 4him 1the lord  2God] from the paradise of the delicacy, to work the earth from which he was taken.

24. And he cast out  Adam, and settled him before the paradise of the delicacy, and ordered the cherubim, and the flaming [2broadsword  1turning], to guard the way of the tree  of life.  

## Genesis 4

1.  Cain and Abel And Adam knew Eve  his wife. And conceiving, she bore  Cain, and said, I acquired a man through  God.

2. And she added to bear  his brother,  Abel. And Abel became a shepherd of sheep, but Cain was working the land.

3. And it came to pass after some days, Cain brought from the fruits of the land a sacrifice to the lord.

4. And Abel brought also himself from the first-born  of his sheep, and from  his fatlings. And God looked upon Abel and upon  his gifts.

5. But upon Cain and upon  his sacrifices, he did not take heed. And Cain fretted exceedingly, and became downcast in the face.

6. And [3said 1the lord  2God]  to Cain, Why [2dejected 1are you], and why is [2downcast  1your face]?

7. If not rightly you brought, [3rightly 1but 2not] divided, you sinned? Be still, to you shall be  his submission, and you will control him!

8. And Cain said to Abel  his brother, Let us go into the plain. And it came to pass in  their being in the plain, Cain rose up against Abel  his brother, and killed him.

9. And [3said 1the lord  2God] to Cain, Where is Abel  your brother? And he said, I do not know, [2not 3the keeper  4of my brother 1I am].

10. And the lord said, What did you do? The voice of the blood  of your brother yells to me from the ground.

11. And now, accursed are you from the earth which gaped wide  her mouth to take the blood  of your brother from  your hand.

12. When you work the ground, and it does not add  [2her strength 1to give] to you; then in moaning and trembling you will be upon the earth.

13. And Cain said to the lord, [2is too great  1My fault]  to forgive me.

14. If you cast me today from the face of the earth, and from  your face, I will hide, and I will be moaning and trembling upon the earth; and it will be all the ones finding me will kill me.

15. And [3said 4to him 1the lord  2God], Not so, all  killing Cain [3seven times 2by punishing 1will be disabled]. And [3put 1the lord  2God] a sign to Cain  [4to not 5do away with 6him 1for all  2finding 3him].

16. [3went forth 1And 2Cain] from the face  of God, and he lived in the land of Nod, over against Eden.

17. And Cain knew  his wife. And she, conceiving, bore  Enoch. And he was building a city, and he named the city after the name  of his son Enoch.

18. [3was born 1And  2to Enoch] Irad; and Irad procreated  Mehujael; and Mehujael procreated  Methusael; and Methusaela procreated  Lamech.

19. And [2took 3to himself 1Lamech] two wives; the name to the one was Adah, and the name to the second was Zillah.

20. And Adah bore  Jabel, this one was father of the ones living in tents, grazing cattle.

21. And the name to his brother was Jubal, this one was the one introducing the psaltery and the harp.

22. But Zillah also herself bore  Tubal-cain, and he was a hammer-smith brazier of brass and of iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

23. [3said 1And 2Lamech] to his own wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my  voice, O wives of Lamech! Give ear to my  words! for [2a man 1I killed] for giving a wound to me, and a young man for giving a stripe to me.

24. For [2seven times 1punishment] is for Cain, but for Lamech, seventy times seven.

25. [3knew 1And 2Adam] Eve  his wife. And conceiving, she bore a son, and named  his name Seth, saying, [3raised up 1For 4to me  2God 6seed 5another] instead of Abel, whom Cain killed.

26. And to Seth was born a son. And he named  his name Enos; this one hoped to call upon the name of the lord  God.

## Genesis 6

1.  Noah Finds Favor And it came to pass when [3began  2men 1many] to become upon the earth, and daughters were born to them.

2. [5were beholding 1And 2the 3sons  4of God] the daughters of men, that they are good, that they took to themselves women from all of whom they chose.

3. And [3said 1the lord  2God], No way should [2stay  1my spirit] with  these men, on account of  their being flesh; [3will be 1and  2their days] a hundred twenty years.

4. And the giants were upon the earth in  those days. And after that, [4continually 5entered 1the 2sons  3of God] to the daughters  of men, and procreated for themselves. Those were the giants, the ones from the eon, the [2men  1renowned].

5. [4beholding 1And 2the lord  3God] that [4were multiplying 1the 2evils  3of men] upon the earth, and all that man considered in  his heart was diligently upon the wicked things all the days,

6. and God pondered that he made the man upon the earth, and he considered it.

7. And [2said  1God], I will wipe away the man, whom I made, from the face of the earth; from man unto beast, and from the reptiles unto the winged creatures of the heaven; for I repented that I made them.

8. But Noah found favor before the lord  God.

9. And these are the origins of Noah. Noah [2man 1was a just] being perfect in  his generation;  [3to God 2was well-pleasing 1Noah].

10. [3procreated 1And 2Noah] three sons,  Shem,  Ham,  Japheth.

11. [4was corrupt 1But 2the 3earth] before  God, and [3was filled 1the 2earth] with iniquity.

12. And [3beheld 1the lord  2God] the earth, and it was being corrupted, for [3corrupted 1all 2flesh]  his way upon the earth.

13. And [3said 1the lord  2God]  to Noah, Time for every man comes before me; for [3is filled 1the 2earth] with iniquity by means of them. And behold, I lay them waste, and the earth.

14. Make then for yourself an ark from [2wood 1four-cornered]! Nested compartments you shall make among the ark, and you shall apply asphalt to it -- from inside and from outside with the asphalt.

15. And so you shall make the ark -- three hundred cubits the length of the ark, and fifty cubits the width, and thirty cubits the height of it.

16. By an assembling, you shall make the ark; and by a cubit you shall complete it from above; but the door of the ark you shall make from out of the side. [3with ground 4second stories 5and 6third stories 1You shall make 2it].

17. And I, behold, I bring the flood of water upon the earth to lay waste all flesh in which is a breath of life underneath the heaven. And as much as might be upon the earth shall come to an end.

18. And I will establish  my covenant with you. And you shall enter into the ark, you and  your sons, and  your wife, and the wives  of your sons with you.

19. And from all the cattle, and from all the reptiles, and from all the wild beasts, and from all flesh, two by two from all you shall bring into the ark, that you may maintain them with yourself -- male and female they shall be.

20. From all the fowl according to type, and from all the cattle according to type, and from all the reptiles  crawling upon the earth according to their type; two by two from all shall enter to you, to be maintained with you, male and female.

21. But you shall take to yourself from all of the foods which you shall eat, and you shall bring them together to yourself, and it shall be to you and to them to eat.

22. And Noah did all as much as [3gave charge 4to him 1the lord  2God] -- so he did.  

## Genesis 7

1.  The Flood And [3said 1the lord  2God] to Noah, Enter, you and all  your house into the ark! for I beheld you as just before me among  this generation.

2. And of the [2cattle  1clean], bring in for yourself seven by seven, male and female! but from the cattle of the ones not clean, two by two, male and female.

3. And from the winged creatures of the heaven, of the clean, seven by seven, male and female; and from all the winged creatures of the ones not clean, two by two, male and female, to maintain seed upon all the earth.

4. For yet [2days 1seven] I will bring rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights. And I will wipe away every  height which I made from the face of all the earth.

5. And Noah did all as much as [3gave charge 4to him 1the lord  2God].

6. And Noah was [2years old 1six hundred], and the flood of the water came upon the earth.

7. [3entered 1And 2Noah], and  his sons, and  his wife, and the wives  of his sons with him, into the ark, because of the water of the flood.

8. And from the winged creatures of the clean, and from the winged creatures of the ones not clean, and from the cattle of the ones clean, and from the cattle of the ones not clean, and from the wild beasts, and from all of the ones crawling upon the earth,

9. two by two they entered with Noah into the ark, male and female, as [2gave charge 3to him  1God].

10. And it came to pass after the seven days, and the water of the flood came upon the earth.

11. In the six hundredth year in the life  of Noah, the second month, seventh and twentieth of the month, in this day, [6tore 1all 2the 3springs 4of the 5abyss], and the torrents of the heaven were opened.

12. And [2was 1rain] upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13. In  this day entered Noah, Shem, Ham, Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah, and the three wives  of his sons with him into the ark.

14. And all the wild beasts according to type, and all the cattle according to type, and every reptile moving upon the earth, according to type, and every winged creature according to type,

15. they entered with Noah, into the ark, two by two, male and female, from all flesh in which there is a breath of life.

16. And the ones entering, male and female, from all flesh, entered as God gave charge to Noah. And [3locked 1the lord  2God] the ark from outside of it.

17. And came to pass the flood forty days and forty nights. And [3multiplied 1the 2water] and lifted up the ark, and raised it up high from the earth.

18. And [3prevailed 1the 2water] and multiplied exceedingly upon the earth. And [3was borne 1the 2ark] upon the water.

19. But the water prevailed exceedingly exceedingly upon the earth, and covered all the [2mountains  1high] which were underneath the heaven.

20. Fifteen cubits above was [3raised 1the 2water], and it covered over all the [2mountains  1high].

21. And there died all flesh moving upon the earth of the winged creatures, and of the cattle, and from wild beasts, and every reptile moving upon the earth, and every man,

22. and all as much as have the breath of life, and all which was upon the dry land died.

23. And he wiped away every  height which was upon the face of all the earth, from man unto beast, and reptiles, and the winged creatures of the heaven; and they were wiped away from the earth; and he left behind only Noah and the ones with him in the ark.

24. And [3was raised up high 1the 2water] from the earth [3days 1a hundred 2fifty].  

## Genesis 8

1.  The Ark Settles on Ararat And God called to mind  Noah, and all of the wild beasts, and all of the cattle, and all of the winged creatures, and all of the crawling things, as much as was with him in the ark. And God brought a wind upon the earth, and [3abated 1the 2water].

2. And were revealed the springs of the abyss and the torrents of the heaven. And [3was constrained 1the 2rain] from the heaven.

3. And [3gave way 1the 2water] going from the earth; and [3was lessened 1the 2water] after fifty and a hundred days.

4. And [3settled 1the 2ark] in the seventh month, the seventh and twentieth of the month, upon the mountains  of Ararat.

5. And the water going forth lessened unto the tenth month. In the first of the month, [5appeared 1the 2heads 3of the 4mountains].

6. And it came to pass after forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark which he made. And he sent forth the crow  to see if [3abated 1the 2water].

7. And going forth it returned not until the drying of the water from the earth.

8. And he sent the dove after it to see if [3abated 1the 2water] from the earth.

9. And [3no 4finding 1the 2dove] rest  for her feet, returned to him into the ark, for water was upon all the face of the earth. And stretching out the hand, he took her to himself, and he brought her into the ark.

10. And waiting still [3days 2seven 1another], again he sent out the dove from the ark.

11. And [3returned 4to 5him 1the 2dove]; and she had [3leaf 2of an olive 1a twig] in  her mouth; and Noah knew that [3abated 1the 2water] from the earth.

12. And waiting still [3days 2seven 1another]; again he sent out the dove; and she proceeded not  to return to him again.

13. And it came to pass in the one and six hundredth year in the life  of Noah, the first month, day one of the month, [3subsided 1the 2water] from the earth. And Noah uncovered the roof of the ark which he made. And he beheld that [3subsided 1the 2water] from the face of the earth.

14. And in the [2month 1second], seventh and twentieth of the month, [3was dried 1the 2earth].

15. And [3said 1the lord  2God] to Noah, saying,

16. Come forth from out of the ark, you and  your wife, and  your sons, and the wives  of your sons with you!

17. And all flesh from winged creatures unto cattle, and every reptile moving upon the earth, lead out with yourself! And grow and multiply upon the earth!

18. And Noah came forth, and  his wife, and  his sons, and the wives  of his sons with him.

19. And all the wild beasts, and all the cattle, and every winged creature, and every reptile moving upon the earth, according to their type, came forth from the ark.

20. And Noah built an altar to the lord. And he took from all the [2cattle  1clean], and from all the [2winged creatures  1clean], and offered them for a whole burnt-offering upon the altar.

21. And the lord smelled the scent of pleasant aroma. And [3said 1the lord  2God], In considering, I will not add yet to curse the earth on account of the works  of men, for [4clings 1the 2thought  3of man] upon the wicked things from his youth. I will not add then still to strike all [2flesh 1living] as I did.

22. All the days of the earth, seed and harvest, chilliness and sweltering heat, summer and spring, day and night, will not be caused to cease.  

## Genesis 9

1.  God's Covenant with Noah And God blessed  Noah, and  his sons, and said to them, Grow and multiply, and fill the earth, and dominate it!

2. And the fear of you and  trembling will be upon all the wild beasts of the earth, upon all the winged creatures of the heaven, and upon all the things moving upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea. Under your hands I have given them to you.

3. And every reptile which is living shall be to you for food; as [3vegetation 4of grass 1I have given 5to you  2all].

4. Except [3meat 4with 5the blood 6of life 1you shall not 2eat].

5. For even  your blood -- of the blood of your lives at the hand of all the wild beasts I shall require it, and from the hand of a man's brother I shall require it.

6. The one shedding blood of a man, in return  his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God I made the man.

7. But you grow, and multiply, and fill the earth, and multiply upon the earth!

8. And God said  to Noah, and  to his sons, saying,

9. Behold, I raise up  my covenant to you, and to your seed after you,

10. and every [2soul 1living] after you, from fowls and from cattle, and with all the wild beasts of the earth, as many as are with you, from all the ones coming forth from out of the ark.

11. And I will establish  my covenant with you, and [3will not 4die 1all 2flesh] any longer from the water of the flood; and there shall not be any longer a flood of water  to lay waste all the earth.

12. And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I execute between me and you, and between every [2soul 1living], as many as are with you for [2generations 1eternal].

13.  [2my bow 1I put] in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of covenant between me and the earth.

14. And it will be in  my collecting together the clouds upon the earth, [3will be seen 1the 2bow] in the cloud.

15. And I will remember  my covenant which is between me and you, and between every [2soul 1living] among all flesh. And there will not be any longer the water for a flood so as to wipe away all flesh.

16. And [2will be  1my bow] in the cloud; and I will see it  to remember [2covenant 1the eternal] between me and the earth, and between [2soul 1the living] which is in all flesh upon the earth.

17. And God said  to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant of which I ordained between me and between all flesh which is upon the earth. 

18.  Shem, Ham and Japheth And these were the sons of Noah, the ones coming forth from the ark, Shem, Ham, Japheth. And Ham was father of Canaan.

19. These three are the sons of Noah. From these, men were disseminated upon all the earth.

20. And [3began 1Noah 2the man] to be a farmer of the land. And he planted a vineyard,

21. and drank from the wine, and became intoxicated, and became naked in  his house.

22. And [5looked at 1Ham 2the 3father 4of Canaan] the nakedness  of his father; and going forth, he announced it  [2two 3brothers 1to his] outside.

23. And [4taking 1Shem 2and 3Japheth] the cloak, placed it upon  [2two 3backs 1their], and went backwards, and they covered up the nakedness  of their father; and  their face was backwards, and [3the 4nakedness  5of their father 1they did not 2look at].

24. [3sobered up 1And 2Noah] from the wine, and knew as much as [4did 5to him  3son 1his  2younger].

25. And he said, Accursed be Canaan -- a child, [2a domestic servant 1he will be] to his brothers.

26. And he said, Blessed be the lord  God  of Shem, and Canaan will be [3servant 2domestic 1his].

27. May God widen  to Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents  of Shem, and let Canaan become their servant.

28. [3lived 1And 2Noah] after the flood three hundred fifty years.

7. Come, and going down, let us confound their language, that they should not [2hearken to 1each] the voice of the neighbor.

8. And the lord scattered them from there upon the face of all the earth; and they ceased building the city and the tower.

2. And I will make you into [2nation 1a great], and I will bless you, and I will magnify  your name, and you will be a blessing.

3. And I will bless the ones blessing you; and the ones cursing you, I will curse. And [6will be blessed 7by 8you 1all 2the 3tribes 4of the 5earth].

10.  Abram and Sarai in Egypt And there was a famine upon the land. And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for [3grew in strength 1the 2famine] upon the land.

11. And it was when Abram approached to enter into Egypt, Abram said to Sarai  his wife, I know that [3woman 2a good-looking 1you are].

12. It will be then as when [3shall see 4you 1the 2Egyptians] they will say that his wife is this one, and they will kill me, [3you 1and 2procure].

13. Say then that! [2his sister 1I am]. so that [2good 3to me 1it may become] on account of you, and [2shall live  1my soul] because of you.

14. And it came to pass when Abram entered into Egypt, [3were looking at 1the 2Egyptians]  his wife, for [3beautiful 1she was 2exceedingly].

19. Why did you say that, [2my sister 1She is]; and I took her to myself as wife? And now, behold,  your wife is before you -- taking her run from me!

3. And he went from where he came into the wilderness, unto Beth-el, unto the place where [3was  1his tent  2formerly], between Beth-el and between Hai;

4. unto the place of the altar which he made there at the beginning. And [2called upon 6there 1Abram 3the 4name 5of the lord].

5. And to Lot, the one going forth with Abram, was sheep, and oxen, and cattle.

6. And [3did not 4have space 5for them 1the 2land] to dwell together, for [2were  1their possessions] many, and they were not able to dwell together.

7. And there was a battle between the herdsmen of the cattle  of Abram, and between the herdsmen of the cattle  of Lot. And the Canaanites and the Perizzites then inhabited the land.

8. [3said 1And 2Abram]  to Lot, Do not let there be a battle between me and you, and between  your herdsmen and between  my herdsmen! for [2men 4brothers 3are 1we].

9. [3not 1Behold 4all 5the 6earth 7before 8you 2is]? Part yourself from me! If you go to the left, I will go to the right; but if you go to the right, I will go to the left.

10. And Lot, lifting up  his eyes, looked upon all the place round about the Jordan, that all was watered (before the eradicating  by God of Sodom and Gomorrah) as the paradise  of God, and as the land of Egypt unto coming into Zoar.

11. And Lot chose to himself all the place round about the Jordan. And Lot departed from the east. And they were parted, each from  his brother.

12. And Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in a city of the place round about, and he pitched a tent in Sodom.

13. But the men  in Sodom were wicked and sinners before  God, exceedingly. 

14.  God Promises Land  And God said  to Abram, after  Lot parted from him, Look up with your eyes, and behold from the place which [3now 1you 2are], to the north and south, and east, and west!

15. That all the land which you see, [3to you 1I will give 2it], and to your seed, unto the eon.

16. And I will make  your seed as the sand of the earth. If [2is able 1anyone] to count out the sand of the earth, then  [2your seed 1they shall count out].

17. In rising up, you travel through the land unto both the length of it and unto the width; for to you I shall give it, and to your seed, into the eon.

18. And moving his tent, Abram came and dwelt around the oak  of Mamre, which was in Hebron. And he built there an altar to the lord.  

## Genesis 14

1.  Abram Rescues Lot And it came to pass in the kingdom  of Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, and Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,

2. they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, and with Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and king Bela -- this is Zoar.

3. All these joined in harmony upon the [2ravine  1salty], this being the sea  of salts.

4. Twelve years they slaved  to Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they revolted.

5. And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came and the kings with him. And they cut in pieces the giants, of the ones in Astaroth Karnaim, and [2nations 1the strong] together with them, and the Emim in Shaveh the city,

6. and the Horites, the ones in the mountains of Seir, unto the terebinth tree  of El-paran, which is in the wilderness.

7. And returning, they came upon the Spring  of Judgment, this is Kadesh. And they cut in pieces all the rulers of Amalek, and the Amorites, of the ones dwelling in Hazezon-tamar.

8. And came forth the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela -- this is Zoar. And they deployed themselves for war in the [2valley  1salty]

9. against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar -- the four kings against the five.

10. And the [2valley  1salty] had wells of asphalt, [4fled 1and 2the king 3of Sodom], and the king of Gomorrah, and they fell in there; and the ones being left behind fled into the mountainous area.

11. And they took [2the 3cavalry 1all]  of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all  their foods, and they went forth.

12. And they took also  Lot, the son of the brother of Abram, and  his belongings, and moved -- for he was dwelling in Sodom.

13. [5coming 1And 3of the 4ones being rescued 2a certain person], reported to Abram, to the traveler. And he dwelt at the oak  of Mamre the Amorite of the brother of Eshcol, and the brother of Aner, who were confederates  of Abram.

14. [3having heard 1And 2Abram] that [4has been captured 1Lot 2the son 3of his brother], counted out  [2own 3native-born servants 1his], three hundred ten and eight. And he pursued unto Dan.

15. And he fell upon them  at night, he and  his manservants. And he struck them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is at the left of Damascus.

16. And he returned all the cavalry of Sodom; and [2Lot 3the son 4of his brother 1he returned], and all  his possessions, and the women, and the people.

17. [4came forth 1And 2the king 3of Sodom] to meet him, after  his returning from the slaughter  of Chedorlaomer, and the kings  with him, into the valley  of Shaveh -- this was the plain of the king. 

18.  Melchisedek King of Salem And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread loaves and wine. And he was priest  of God the highest.

19. And he blessed him. And he said, Abram, a blessing  to God the highest, who created the heaven and the earth.

20. And blessed be  God the highest who delivered up  your enemies under your hands to you. And [2gave 3to him 1Abram] a tenth from all.

21. And said the king of Sodom to Abram, Give to me the men, but the cavalry you take to yourself!

22. [3said 1And 2Abram] to the king of Sodom, I will stretch out  my hand to the lord  God the highest, who created the heaven and the earth,

23. that not [2from 3the string 4unto 5the knob 6of the shoe 1will I take for myself] from all  of your things, that you should not have said that, I enriched  Abram;

24. except what [3ate 1the 2young men] and the portion of the men, of the ones going with me, Eshcol, Aner, Mamre; these will take for themselves a portion.  

## Genesis 15

1.  God Promises Offspring And after  these words came the word of the lord to Abram in a vision, saying, Do not fear Abram, I will shield you.  Your wage [3much 1will be 2exceedingly].

2. [3says 1And 2Abram], Master, O lord, what will you give to me, for I am wasting away childless, but the son of Masek  of my native-born maid servant, this Damascus Eliezer is heir?

3. And Abram said, Since to me you gave not a seed,  then my native-born servant will be heir to me.

4. And straightly the voice of the lord came to him, saying, [2will not 3be heir 4to you 1This one], another will come forth from you, this one will be heir to you.

5. And he led him outside, and said to him, Look up indeed into the heaven, and count out the stars, if you are able to count them! And he said, Thus will be  your seed.

6. And Abram trusted  in God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.

7. And he said to him, I am the God  leading you from out of the place of the Chaldeans, so as to give to you  this land to inherit.

8. And he said, Master, O lord, how will I know that I will inherit it?

9. And he said to him, Take for me a heifer being three years old, and a goat being three years old, and a ram being three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a pigeon!

10. And he took to himself all these, and he divided them in the middle, and put them facing one another; but the birds he did not divide.

11. [3came down 1And 2birds] upon the [3bodies  1pieces 2of their], and [2sat down 3with them 1Abram].

12. And about [2of the sun 1the descent] a change of state fell upon  Abram. And behold, [3fear 2dark 1a great] fell upon him.

13. And it was said to Abram, In knowing you will know that [3a sojourner 2will be  1your seed] in a land not their own, and they will enslave them, and will afflict them, and humble them four hundred years.

14. But the nation which ever they may be slave to, I will judge. And after these things they shall come forth here with [2belongings 1much].

15. But you shall go forth to  your fathers with peace, being entombed in [2old age 1a good].

16. And the fourth generation shall return here, for not yet have [5been filled up 1the 2sins 3of the 4Amorites] unto the present.

17. And when the sun was in descent, a flame came, and behold, there was an oven smoking; and there were lamps of fire which went through in the midst  of these pieces.

18. In  that day the lord ordained a covenant  with Abram, saying, To your seed I will give  this land, from the river of Egypt unto the river of the great Euphrates,

19. the Kenites, and the Kenizites, and the Kadmonites,

21. and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.  

## Genesis 16

1.  Sarai and Hagar And Sarai, the wife of Abram, bore not to him. But there was to her a maidservant, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

2. [3said 1And 2Sarai] to Abram, Behold, [2closed me up 1the lord]  to not bear. Enter then to  my maidservant, that I may produce children from her! [3obeyed 1And 2Abram] the voice of Sarai.

3. And [4having taken 1the 2wife 3of Abram] Hagar the Egyptian  her maidservant, after ten years  of living with Abram in the land of Canaan, and she gave her to Abram her husband to him for wife.

4. And he entered to Hagar, and she conceived. And she saw that [2in 3the womb 1she had a child], and [3was dishonored 1the 2lady] before her.

5. [3said 1And 2Sarai] to Abram, I am being wronged because of you. I gave  my maidservant to  your bosom. And seeing that [2a child in 3the womb 1she had] I was dishonored before her. May God judge between me and you.

6. [3said 1And 2Abram] to Sarai, Behold,  your maidservant is in  your hands, treat her however [2pleasing to you 1might be]. And [2maltreated 3her 1Sarai], and she ran away from her face.

7. [4found 1And 5her 2the angel 3of the lord] upon the spring  of water in the wilderness, upon the land in the way of Shur.

8. And [4said 5to her 1the 2angel 3of the lord], Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, from what place do you come, and where do you go? And she said, [3from 4the face 5of Sarai  6my lady 1I 2am running away].

9. [5said 1And 6to her 2the 3angel 4of the lord], You return to  your lady, and be humble under  her hands!

10. And [4said 5to her 1the 2angel 3of the lord], In multiplying I will multiply  your seed, and it shall not be counted because of the multitude. 

11.  Birth of Ishmael And [4said 5to her 1the 2angel 3of the lord], Behold, you [2in 3the womb 1have a child], and you shall bear a son, and you shall call  his name, Ishmael, for the lord heeded  your humiliation.

12. This one will be a rugged man;  his hands will be upon all, and the hands of all upon him. And [2before 3the face 4of all  5his brothers 1he will dwell].

13. And she called the name of the lord, the one speaking to her, You, the God, the one looking upon me; for she said, For even face to face I beheld the one appearing to me.

14. Because of this she called the well, Well of which [2Face to Face 1I Beheld]. Behold, it is between Kadesh and between Bared.

15. And Hagar bore  to Abram a son. And Abram called the name  of his son, whom [2bore 3to him 1Hagar], Ishmael.

16. And Abram was [2years old 1eighty-six] when Hagar bore to Abram,  Ishmael.  

## Genesis 17

1.  Covenant and Circumcision [3was 1And 2Abram 5years old 4ninety-nine], and the lord appeared  to Abram, and he said to him, I am  your God, you are well-pleasing before me -- then be blameless!

2. And I will establish  my covenant between me and between you, and I will multiply you exceedingly.

3. And Abram fell upon his face. And [2spoke 3to him  1God], saying,

4. And behold,  my covenant is with you, and you will be father of a multitude of nations.

5. And [2will not 3be called 4any longer  1your name], Abram; but [2will be  1your name] Abraham, for [3father 4of many 5nations 1I have appointed 2you].

6. And I will increase you exceedingly exceedingly. And I will establish you for nations; and kings [2from 3you 1will come forth].

7. And I will establish  my covenant between me and between you, and between  your seed after you, unto  their generations, for [2covenant 1an eternal], to be your God, and  with your seed after you.

8. And I will give to you and to your seed after you the land which you sojourn, all the land of Canaan for [2possession 1an eternal]. And I myself will be to them for God.

9. And God said to Abraham, You also  [2my covenant 1shall observe], and  your seed after you for  their generations.

10. And this is the covenant which you shall observe between me and you, and between  your seed after you. [4shall be circumcised 3to you 1Every 2male].

11. And you shall be circumcised of the flesh  of your foreskin. And it will be for a sign of covenant between me and you.

12. And a male child eight days old shall be circumcised by you -- every male into  your generations; the native-born servant  of your house, and the one bought with silver, from every son of an alien who is not from  your seed.

13. By circumcision he shall be circumcised -- the native-born servant  of your house, and the one bought with silver. And [2will be  1my covenant] upon  your flesh for [2covenant 1an eternal].

14. And the uncircumcised male who shall not be circumcised in the flesh  of his foreskin in the [2day  1eighth], [2shall be utterly destroyed  1that soul] from  its race, for  my covenant he effaced.

15. And God said  to Abraham, Sarai  your wife -- [2shall not 3be called  1her name] Sarai, but, Sarah will be  her name. 

16.  The Promise of a Son And I will bless her, and give to you from her a child. And I will bless it, and it will be for nations; and kings of nations [2from 3him 1will be].

17. And Abraham fell upon his face and laughed. And he said in  his mind, saying, Shall to the hundred year old be a son? And shall  Sarah at ninety years bear?

18. [3said 1And 2Abraham] to  God, Ishmael, this one, let him live before you!

19. [3said 1And  2God] to Abraham, Yes, behold, Sarah  your wife will bear to you a son, and you shall call  his name Isaac; and I will establish  my covenant with him, for [2covenant 1an eternal], and to his seed after him.

20. And concerning Ishmael, behold, I heeded you. And behold, I shall bless him, and I will increase him, and I will multiply him exceedingly. Twelve nations he will procreate, and I will make him for [2nation 1a great].

21.  But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom [2shall bear 3to you 1Sarah] at  this time in  [2year  1another].

22. And he completed speaking to him. And God ascended from Abraham.

23. And Abraham took Ishmael,  his son, and all  his native-born servants, and all the ones bought with silver, and every male of the men  in the house of Abraham. And he circumcised  their foreskins in  [2time 3of the 4day 1that], as [2spoke 3to him  1God].

24. And Abraham [2ninety-nine 1was] years old when he circumcised the flesh  of his foreskin.

25. And Ishmael  his son was [2years old 1thirteen] when he circumcised the flesh  of his foreskin.

26. In  [2time 3of the 4day 1that] Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael  his son,

27. and all the males  of his house, and the native-born servants, and the ones bought with silver from foreign nations.  

## Genesis 18

1.  The LORD Appears at Mamre [3appeared 1And 4to him  2God] before the oak  in Mamre, at his sitting near the door  of his tent at midday.

2. And lifting up  his eyes he saw; and behold, three men had set upon him. And seeing, he ran up to meet with them from the door  of his tent. And he did obeisance upon the ground.

3. And he said, O Lord, if surely I found favor before you, you should not go by  your servant.

4. Let there be taken now water, and let them wash  your feet, and be cooled under the tree!

5. And I will bring bread, and you shall eat, and after this you shall go in  your journey, because of which you turned aside to  your servant. And they said, Thus do as you have said!

6. And Abraham hastened unto the tent to Sarah. And he said to her, Hasten and mix up three measures of fine flour, and make a cake baked in hot ashes!

7. And [2to 3the 4oxen 1Abraham ran], and he took a tender [3young calf 1and 2good], and gave it to the servant; and he hastened  to prepare it.

8. And he took butter, and milk, and the young calf which he prepared, and placed it near to them, and they ate. And he stood beside them under the tree.

9. And he said to him, Where is Sarah  your wife?  And answering he said, Behold, in the tent.

10. And he said, Returning, I will come to you according to  this time to the hour; and [3will have 4a son 1Sarah  2your wife]. And Sarah heard by the door of the tent, being behind him.

11. And Abraham and Sarah were older, advanced of days, [3ceased 1and 2Sarah] to be in the feminine ways.

12. [3laughed 1And 2Sarah] in herself, saying, For not yet has it happened to me until  now,  and my lord is older.

13. And the lord said to Abraham, Why is it that Sarah laughed in herself, saying, Indeed is it truly I will bear, and I have grown old?

14. Is [2impossible 3to 4the lord 1the saying]? At  this time to the hour I will return to you, and there will be  to Sarah a son.

15. [3denied 1But 2Sarah], saying, I did not laugh; for she feared. And he said to her, No, but you laughed!

16. And having risen up from there, the men looked down upon the face of Sodom and Gomorrah. And Abraham went with them, escorting them.

17. And the lord said, No way shall I hide from Abraham  my servant what I do.

18. [3to Abraham 1But 2coming to pass], he will be made into [4nation 1a great 2and 3populous], and [6shall be blessed 7by 8him 1all 2the 3nations 4of the 5earth].

19. For I had known that he will order  his sons, and  his house after him; and they will guard the ways of the lord,  to do righteousness and judgment; that  the lord may bring upon Abraham all as much as he said to him.

20. [3said 1And 2the lord], The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah has multiplied towards me, and  their sins are great, exceedingly.

21. Going down then, I will see if it is according to  their cry, the cry coming to me that they exhaust; and if not, that I may know.

22. And turning back from there, the men came unto Sodom. And Abraham was still standing before the lord.

23. And Abraham approaching, said, You would not destroy together the just with the impious, and [3will be 1the 2just] as the impious?

24. If there might be fifty just in the city, will you destroy them? Will you not spare all the place because of the fifty just, if there should be so in it?

25. By no means shall you do as  this saying,  to kill the just with the impious, and [3shall be 1the 2just] as the impious; by no means, O one judging all the earth. Will you not execute judgment?

26. [3said 1And 2the lord], If there should be in Sodom fifty just in the city, I will leave off doing so to all the place on account of them.

27. And Abraham responding said, Now that I began to speak to  my Lord, and I am earth and ashes.

28. But if [4may be lessened 1the 2fifty 3just] to forty-five, will you destroy because of the five, all the city? And he said, No way will I destroy if I find there forty-five.

29. And he added yet to speak to him. And he said, But if there may be found there forty? And he said, No way should I destroy because of the forty.

30. And he said, Much less, O Lord, if I may speak, but if there may be found there thirty? And he said, No way will I destroy because of the thirty.

31. And he said, Since I have taken to speak to the Lord, but if there may be found there twenty? And he said, No way will I destroy if I should find there twenty.

32. And he said, Much less, O Lord, if I may speak still once more, but if there may be found there ten? And he said, No way will I destroy because of the ten.

33. [3went forth 1And 2the lord] as he ceased speaking  to Abraham, and Abraham returned to  his place.  

## Genesis 19

1.  Eradication of Sodom and Gomorrah [5came 1And 2the 3two 4angels] into Sodom at evening. And Lot settled by the city of Sodom. And seeing, Lot rose up to meet them, and did obeisance with his face upon the ground.

2. And he said, Behold lords, turn aside to the house  of your servant, and rest up, and wash  your feet! that rising early you may go forth into  your way. And they said, No, but in the square we will rest up.

3. And he constrained them, and they turned aside towards him, and entered unto  his house. And he made for them a banquet, and [2unleavened breads 1he baked] for them, and they ate.

4. Before  putting to bed, the men of the city, the Sodomites, surrounded the house, from the young man unto the older, all the people together.

5. And they called forth  Lot. And they said to him, Where are they, the men, the ones entering to you  this night? Lead them to us, that we may be intimate with them!

6. [3came forth 1And 2Lot] to them, to the threshold, [3the 1and 4door 2he shut] behind him.

7. And he said to them, By no means, brethren, should you do wickedly.

8. But there are to me two daughters who knew not a man. I will lead them to you, and you treat them as  pleases you! Only to  these men you should not do unjust, because they entered under the protection  of my beams.

9. And they said to him, You left there to enter here to sojourn, and not [2with judgment 1to judge]. Now then to you we will inflict evil rather  than them. And they were pressing the man  Lot exceedingly, and they approached to break the door.

10. [4stretching out 1And 2the 3men] the hands, drew  Lot towards themselves into the house, and the door of the house they locked.

11. And the men  being at the door of the house were struck with inability to see, from small unto great, and they were disabled in seeking the door.

12. [4said 1And 2the 3men] to Lot, Are there [2to you 3here 1in-laws], or sons or daughters? Or if [2any 4to you 3other 1there is] in the city you lead them out of  this place!

13. For we destroy  this place. For [2was raised up high  1their cry] before the lord, and [2sent 3us 1the lord] to obliterate it.

14. [3went forth 1And 2Lot] and spoke to  his sons-in-law, the ones taking  his daughters. And he said, Rise up, and come forth from out of  this place, for the lord is obliterating the city. [4he seemed 1But 5to be joking 2before  3his sons-in-law].

15. And when dawn came [3hurried 1the 2angels]  Lot, saying, In rising up, take  your wife and  [2two 3daughters 1your] whom you have, and come forth! that [3not 4also 1you 2should] be destroyed together in the lawlessnesses of the city.

16. And they were disturbed, and [3held 1the 2angels]  his hand, and the hand  of his wife, and the hands  [2two 3daughters 1of his], in the lord sparing him.

17. And it came to pass when they led them outside, and said, By escaping escape with your own life! You should not look round about to the rear, nor stand in any  round about place. [2into 3the 4mountain 1Escape]! lest at any time you may be taken along with them.

18. [3said 1And 2Lot] to them, I beseech, O lord,

19. since [2found  1your servant] favor before you, and you magnified  your righteousness, which you do unto me, that [2may live  1my soul], but I will not be able to come through safe into the mountain, lest [2overtake 3me  1evils] and I die.

20. Behold,  this city is near  for me to take refuge there, which is small, there I will be delivered. [2not 3a small thing 1Is it] that [2will live  1my soul] because of you?

21. And he said to him, Behold, I admired your  countenance over  this saying,  that I should not eradicate the city, concerning of which you spoke.

22. You hasten then  to escape there, [3not 1for 2I will] be able  to do the thing until  you go there! On account of this he called the name  of that city, Zoar.

23. The sun came up upon the earth, and Lot entered into Zoar.

24. And the lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the lord from out of heaven.

25. And he eradicated  these cities, and all the place round about, and all the ones dwelling in the cities, and the things rising from out of the ground. 

26.  Lot's Wife Becomes a Monument of Salt And [2looked  1his wife] unto the rear, and she became a monument of salt.

27. [3rose early 1And 2Abraham] in the morning to the place of which he had stood before the lord.

28. And he looked upon the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and upon the face of the place round about. And he saw. And behold, [2ascended 1a flame] from out of the earth, as vapor of a furnace.

29. And it came to pass in  God obliterating all the [2cities  1adjacent], God remembered  Abraham, and he sent out  Lot from the middle of the final event, in the eradicating the cities in which [2dwelt 3in 4them 1Lot]. 

30.  Incest Between Lot and His Daughters [3came forth 1And 2Lot] from out of Zoar, and settled in the mountain, and the two daughters of his with him; for he feared dwelling in Zoar. And he dwelt in the cave, he and the two daughters of his with him.

31. [4said 1And 2the 3elder] to the younger,  Our father is older, and there is no one upon the land who will enter to us, as it is fit in all the earth.

32. Come and we should give [3to drink  1our father 2wine], and we should go to bed with him, that we might raise up [2from  3our father 1seed].

33. And they gave [3to drink  1their father 2wine] in  that night. And entering, the elder went to bed with  her father in  that night, and he did not know about  her going to bed and rising up.

34. And it came to pass in the next day, and [3said 1the 2elder] to the younger, Behold, I went to bed yesterday with  our father. We should give [3to drink 1him 2wine] also in  this night, and entering, you go to bed with him! that we might raise up [2from  3our father 1seed].

35. And they gave to drink also in  that night  [2for their father 1wine]. And entering, the younger went to bed with  her father. And he did not know about  her going to bed and rising up.

36. And [5conceived 1the 2two 3daughters 4of Lot] from  their father.

37. And [3bore 1the 2elder] a son, and she called  his name Moab, saying, He is from  my father. This one is father of the Moabites, unto  today's day.

38. [5bore 1And 4also 2the 3younger] a son, and she called  his name Ammon, he is a son of my family. This one is father of the Ammonites until  today's day.  

## Genesis 20

1.  Abraham Deceives Abimelech And [2moved 3from there 1Abraham] into the land towards the south, and lived between Kadesh and between Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

2. [3said 1And 2Abraham] concerning Sarah  his wife, that, [2my sister 1She is]. For he feared to say that, [2my wife 1She is], lest at any time [5should kill 6him 1the 2men 3of the 4city] on account of her. [5sent 1So 2Abimelech 3king 4of Gerar], and he took  Sarah.

3. And God entered to Abimelech by sleep in the night. And he said, Behold, you die on account of the woman of whom you took, for she is living with a man.

4. And Abimelech [3not 1touched 2her]. And he said, O Lord, [2a nation 3ignorant 4and 5just 1will you destroy]?

5. [3not 2he 4to me 1Said], [2sister 1She is my]; and she said to me, [2brother 1He is my]? With a clean heart, and with righteousness of hands I did this.

6. [3said 1And 4to him  2God] by sleep, And I knew that with a clean heart you did this, and I spared you for [2to not 3sin 1you] against me; because of this I did not let you  touch her.

7. And now give back the wife of the man, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for your account, and you shall live. But if you do not give back, you shall know that you shall die, you and all  yours.

8. And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and he called all  his servants. And he spoke all  these words into  their ears. [5feared 1And 2all 3the 4men] exceedingly.

9. And Abimelech called  Abraham. And he said to him, What is this you did to us, lest we sinned against you, that you bring upon me and upon  my kingdom [2sin 1a great]? A work which no one will do, you have done to me.

10. [3said 1And 2Abimelech]  to Abraham, What seeing did you do this?

11. [3said 1And 2Abraham], For I said, Surely there is not godliness in  this place, [3me 1and 2they will kill] because  of my wife.

12. For also truly [2sister 1she is my] from my father, but not from my mother; and she became to me for wife.

13. And it happened when [2led 3me  1God] from the house  of my father, and I said to her, This  righteousness you will do for me in every place of which ever I enter; there you say of me that, [2brother 1He is my]!

14. [3took 1And 2Abimelech] a thousand double-drachmas, and sheep, and calves, and manservants, and maidservants, and gave  to Abraham, and he gave back to him Sarah  his wife.

15. And Abimelech said  to Abraham, Behold,  my land is before you, which ever it may please you, dwell there!

16. And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given a thousand double-drachmas  to your brother, these will be to you for the value  of your person, and all the ones with you; and [2in all things 1you be truthful]!

17. [3prayed 1And 2Abraham] to  God. And God healed  Abimelech, and  his wife, and  his maidservants, and they bore.

18. For in closing up, the lord closed up outside every  womb in the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah the wife of Abraham.  

## Genesis 21

1.  Birth of Isaac And the lord visited  Sarah as he said, and the lord did  to Sarah as he spoke.

2. And conceiving, she bore  to Abraham a son in his old age, in the time as [2spoke 3to him 1the lord].

3. And Abraham called the name  of his son, the one born to him whom [2bore 3to him 1Sarah] -- Isaac.

4. [3circumcised 1And 2Abraham]  Isaac on the eighth day as [2gave charge 3to him  1God].

5. And Abraham was a hundred years old when [3was born 4to him 1Isaac  2his son].

6. [3said 1And 2Sarah], [3laughter 4to me 2caused 1The lord], for whoever may hear will rejoice along with me.

7. And she said, Who will announce  to Abraham that [2nurses 3a male child 1Sarah], for I bore a son in  my old age.

8. And [3grew 1the 2child] and was weaned. And Abraham made [2banquet 1a great] the day [3was weaned 1Isaac  2his son]. 

9.  Hagar Cast Out [3beholding 1And 2Sarah] the son of Hagar the Egyptian, who was born to Abraham, playing with Isaac  her son,

10. that she said  to Abraham, You cast out  this maidservant and  her son,  for [5shall not 6be heir 1the 2son 3of the 4maidservant] with  my son Isaac.

11. [6hard 1But 4appeared 2the 3saying 5very] before Abraham concerning  his son Ishmael.

12. [3said 1And  2God]  to Abraham, [2not 4hard 1Let it 3be] before you on account of the child, and on account of the maidservant! All as much as [2should have said 3to you 1Sarah], you hearken to  her voice! for by Isaac [2shall be called 3to you 1a seed].

13. [2also 3the 4son 1But]  of this maidservant [2into 4nation 3a great 1I will make], for he [3seed 2your 1is].

14. [3rose up 1And 2Abraham] in the morning, and took bread loaves and a leather bag of water; and he gave to Hagar, and he placed the male child upon  her shoulders, and he sent her. And she went forth wandering about the wilderness by the Well of the Oath.

15. [4ceased 1But 2the 3water] coming from out of the leather bag, and she tossed the male child underneath one fir tree.

16. And going forth she sat down before him, far off as a bow shot. For she said, no way shall I see the death  of my child. And she sat before him. And yelling out the child wept.

17. [3listened to 1But  2God] the voice of the child from the place where he was. And [3called 1an angel 2of God]  Hagar from out of the heaven, and said to her, What is it, Hagar? Fear not! [3has heeded 1for  2God] the voice  of your child from out of the place where he is.

18. Rise up and take the child, and hold  [2in your hand 1it]! [4into 1For 6nation 5a great 2I will make 3it].

19. And God opened  her eyes. And she saw a well [2water 1of living]. And she went and filled the leather bag  of water, and gave a drink to the child.

20. And God was with the child. And he grew, and he dwelt in the wilderness. And he became a bowman.

21. And he dwelt in the wilderness in Parah. And [2took 3to him  1his mother] a wife from the land of Egypt. 

22.  Abraham's Covenant with Abimelech And it came to pass in  that time, that Abimelech spoke, along with Ahuzzath  his groomsman, and Phichol the commander-in-chief  of his force, to Abraham, saying,  God is with you in all things what ever you should do.

23. Now then swear by an oath to me  by God that you will not wrong me, nor  my seed, nor  my name! but according to the righteousness which I did with you, you shall do with me, and in the land where you sojourned in it.

24. And Abraham said, I will swear by an oath.

25. And Abraham reproved  Abimelech on account of the wells  of water, which [4removed 1the 2servants  3of Abimelech].

26. And [2said 3to him 1Abimelech], I do not know who did  this matter, nor you reported it to me, nor I heard -- but only today.

27. And Abraham took sheep and calves, and gave  to Abimelech, and [2ordained 1both 3a covenant].

28. And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of sheep alone.

29. And Abimelech said  to Abraham, What are the seven ewe-lambs  of sheep -- these, which you set alone?

30. And he said, that,  [4seven 5ewe-lambs 3these 1You shall take 2of] of mine, that they should be to me for a testimony that I dug  this well.

31. Because of this [4was named 1the 2name  3of that place], Well of the Oath, for there [2swore by an oath 1both].

32. And they ordained a covenant at the Well of the Oath. [3rose up 1And 2Abimelech], and Ahuzzath  his groomsman, and Phichol the commander-in-chief  of his force, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.

33. And Abraham planted plowed fields near the Well of the Oath. And he called there the name of the lord, God eternal.

34. [3sojourned 1And 2Abraham] in the land of the Philistines [2days 1many].  

## Genesis 22

1.  Abraham Offers Isaac And it came to pass after  these words,  God tested  Abraham, and said to him, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Behold, it is I.

2. And he said, Take  your son, the beloved, whom you loved --  Isaac! And go into the [2land  1high], and offer him there as a whole offering upon one of the mountains! which ever I may tell you.

3. [3rising up 1And 2Abraham] in the morning, saddled  his donkey, and he took with himself two servants, and Isaac  his son. And splitting wood for a whole offering, [2rising up 3to go 1and], they came upon the place which [2spoke 3to him  1God],  [3day 1on the 2third].

4. And Abraham looking up with his eyes saw the place far off.

5. And Abraham said  to his servants, You sit here with the donkey! and I and the lad will go through unto here. And doing obeisance we will return to you.

6. [3took 1And 2Abraham] the wood for the whole offering, and placed it upon Isaac  his son. And he took with his hands the fire and the knife; and [3went 1the 2two] together.

7. [3said 1And 2Isaac] to Abraham  his father, Father.  And he said, What is it child? And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood, where is the sheep -- the one for a whole offering?

8. [3said 1And 2Abraham],  God will see to himself a sheep for a whole offering, child. [3going 1And 2both] together,

9. they came upon the place which [2spoke 3to him  1God]. And [2built 3there 1Abraham] the altar. And he placed upon it the wood. And binding [3hand and foot 1Isaac  2his son], he placed him upon the altar upon the wood.

10. And Abraham stretched  his hand to take the knife to slay  his son.

11. And [3called 4him 1an angel 2of the lord] from out of the heaven. And he said, Abraham, Abraham.  And he said, Behold, it is I.

12. And he said, You should not put  your hand upon the lad, nor should you do anything to him by any means. For now I know that you fear  God, and spared not  [3son 1your  2beloved] on account of me.

13. And Abraham looking up with his eyes, saw. And behold, [2ram 1one] being held in a plant of a thicket by the horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and he offered it for a whole offering instead of Isaac  his son.

14. And Abraham called the name  of that place, The lord saw; that they may say today, [3in 4the 5mountain 1the lord 2was seen].

15. And [3called 1the angel 2of the lord]  Abraham a second time from out of the heaven, saying,

16. According to myself I swear by an oath, says the lord, because you did  this saying, and you did not spare  [3son 1your  2beloved] on account of me.

17. Assuredly in blessing, I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply  your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand  by the edge of the sea. And [2will inherit  1your seed] the cities of your opponents.

18. And [6will be blessed 7by  8your seed 1all 2the 3nations 4of the 5earth]; because you obeyed  my voice.

19. [3returned 1And 2Abraham] to  his servants. And rising up they went together to the Well of the Oath. And Abraham dwelt near the Well of the Oath.

20. And it came to pass after  these words, that it was announced  to Abraham, saying, Behold, [3has born 1even Milcah 2herself] sons to Nahor  your brother.

21. Huz first-born, and  Buz his brother, and  Kemuel father of the Syrians,

22. and  Chesed, and  Hazo, and  Pildash, and  Jidlaph and  Bethuel.

23. And Bethuel procreated  Rebekah. These are the eight sons whom Milcah bore  to Nahor the brother of Abraham.

24. And  his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore even herself,  Tebah, and  Gaham, and  Thahash, and  Maachah.  

## Genesis 23

1.  The Death and Burial of Sarah [5was 1And 2the 3life 4of Sarah 8years 6a hundred 7twenty-seven].

2. And Sarah died in the city of Arba, which is in the hollow -- this is Hebron in the land of Canaan. [3came 1And 2Abraham] to lament Sarah, and to mourn.

3. And Abraham rose up from  his dead. And Abraham said to the sons of Heth, saying,

4. [2a sojourner 3and 4an immigrant 1I am] among you. Give then to me a possession of a burying-place among you! and I will entomb  my dead away from me.

5. And answered the sons of Heth to Abraham, saying, No, O lord.

6. But hear us; [5as a king 6by 7God 1you 2are 3with 4us]. [3in  5choice 6sepulchres 4our 1You entomb  2your dead]! for not one of us in any way will withhold  his sepulchre from you  to entomb  your dead there.

7. And rising up, Abraham did obeisance to the people of the land, to the sons  of Heth.

8. And [2spoke 3to 4them 1Abraham], saying, If you have it  in your soul so as to entomb  my dead away from my presence, hear me, and speak about me to Ephron,  the son of Zohar!

9. And let him give to me the [2cave  1double] which is his -- the one being in a part  of his field. [4of silver  3for its worth 1Let him give 2it to me], [4among 5you 1for 2a possession 3of a memorial].

10. And Ephron was sitting down in the midst of the sons of Heth. And responding Ephron the Hittite [2to 3Abraham 1spoke] in the hearing of the sons of Heth, and [2the ones 3entering 4into 5the 6city 1of all], saying,

11. By me let it be, O lord, and hear me! The field and the cave  in it I give to you. Before all  of my fellow-countrymen I have given it to you. You entomb  your dead.

12. And Abraham did obeisance before the people of the land.

13. And he said  to Ephron in the ears before the people of the land, Since [2with me 1you are] hear me! The silver for the field, you take from me! and I will entomb  my dead there.

14. [3answered 1And 2Ephron]  Abraham, saying,

15. Not so O lord, for I heard four hundred double-drachmas of silver; but what ever may this be between me and you? But you  [2your dead 1entomb]!

16. And Abraham hearkened  to Ephron. And Abraham restored to Ephron the silver, which he spoke into the ears of the sons of Heth -- four hundred double-drachmas [2silver 1of unadulterated] of merchants.

17. And [4is 1the 2field 5of Ephron 3which] was in  Double Cave, which is against the face of Mamre. The field and the cave which was in it, and every tree which was in the field, which is in  its borders round about,

18. came to Abraham for a possession before the sons of Heth, and all the ones entering into the city.

19. And after these things Abraham entombed Sarah  his wife in the cave of the field at Double Cave, which is before Mamre; this is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

20. And [3was validated 1the 2field], and the cave which was in it to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place from the sons of Heth.  

## Genesis 24

1.  The Search for a Wife And Abraham was older, advancing of days. And the lord blessed  Abraham according to all things.

2. And Abraham said to his servant, to the elder  of his house, to the one in charge of all his things, Put  your hand under  my thigh!

3. And I adjure you by the lord  God of the heaven, and the God of the earth, that you should not take a wife to my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites, with whom I live among them.

4. But only unto  my land of which I was shall you go, and unto  my tribe. And you shall take a wife  for my son Isaac from there.

5. [4said 1And 5to 6him 2the 3servant], If at any time [4not 3wills 1the 2woman] to go with me back into  this land, shall I return  your son into the land from where you came forth from there?

6. [3said 1And 4to 5him 2Abraham], Take heed to yourself that you should not return  my son there.

7. The lord  God of the heaven, and the God of the earth, who took me from  [2house  1my father's], and from the land of which I was born, who spoke to me, and who swore by an oath to me, saying, To you I will give  this land and  your seed -- he will send  his angel in front of you, and you shall take a wife,  for my son from there.

8. And if [3should not 4want 1the 2woman] to go with you into  this land, you will be clean from  this oath. Only  [3my son 1you should not 2return] there.

9. And [3put 1the 2servant]  his hand under the thigh of Abraham  his master. And he swore by an oath to him on account of  this saying.

10. And [3took 1the 2servant] ten camels from the camels  of his master, and from all the good things  of his master with himself. And rising up he went into  Mesopotamia, into the city of Nahor.

11. And he rested the camels outside of the city by the Well of the Water,  towards late in the day, when the women came forth drawing water.

12. And he said, O lord  God  of my master Abraham, prosper the way before me today, and perform mercy with  my master Abraham!

13. Behold, I stand near the spring  of water, and the daughters of the men living in the city come forth to draw water.

14. And it shall be the virgin, who ever I should have said, Incline  your water-pitcher! that I might drink. And she should have said to me, You drink! and  [2your camels 1I will water] until whenever they cease to drink -- this one you prepared  for your servant  Isaac, and in this I will know that you executed mercy with  my master Abraham.

15. And it came to pass before  completing his speaking in  his mind, that behold, Rebekah came forth -- the one born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, and brother of Abraham, having the water-pitcher upon  her shoulders.

16. And the virgin was good in the appearance -- exceedingly. She was a virgin, no man knew her. And coming upon the spring, she filled  her water-pitcher, and ascended.

17. [4ran 1And 2the 3servant] to meet with her, and he said, Give me to drink a little water from out of  your water-pitcher!

18.  And she said, Drink, O lord! And she hastened and lowered the water-pitcher upon  her arm, and gave him to drink until he ceased drinking.

19. And she said, Also to your camels I will draw water until whenever all should have drunk.

20. And she hastened and emptied out the water-pitcher into the channel, and ran yet again unto the well to draw water. And she drew water for all the camels.

21. And the man studied her, and remained silent  to know if the lord prospered  his way or not.

22. And it came to pass when [4ceased 1all 2the 3camels] drinking, [3took 1the 2man] ear-rings of gold worth up to a drachma scale-weight, and two bracelets, and put them upon  her hands -- ten pieces of gold scale-weight was their weight.

23. And he asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? Announce to me if there is by  your father a place for us  to rest up!

24.  And she said to him, [2the daughter 3of Bathuel 1I am], the son of Milcah, whom she bore to  Nahor.

25. And she said to him, Also [2straw 3and 4fodder 1there is much] by us, and a place  to rest up.

26. And [3finding favor 1the 2man], did obeisance to the lord, and said,

27. Blessed be the lord  God  of my master Abraham, who abandoned not  righteousness and  truth from  my master. [2indeed prospered me 1The lord] to the house of the brother  of my master.

28. And running, the maidservant announced in the house  to her mother about  these words.

29. And to Rebekah there was a brother whose name was Laban. And Laban ran to the man outside near the spring.

30. And it came to pass when he saw the ear-rings, and the bracelets upon the hands  of his sister, and when he heard the words of Rebekah  his sister, saying, So spoke to me the man; that he came to the man standing by himself by the camels near the spring.

31. And he said to him, Come, enter blessed of the lord! Why stand outside? For I prepared the residence, and a place for the camels.

32. [4entered 1And 2the 3man] into the residence. And he unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water  for his feet, and for the feet of the men  with him.

33. And he placed near them bread loaves to eat. And he said, No way will I eat until  speaking   my words. And he said, Speak!

34. And he said, A servant of Abraham I am.

35. And the lord blessed  my master exceedingly; and he was raised up high, and he gave to him sheep, and calves, and silver, and pieces of gold, and manservants, and maidservants, camels, and donkeys.

36. And [5bore 1Sarah 2the 3wife  4of my master] a son, one to my master after  his growing old. And he gave to him as much as was his.

37. And [2bound me by an oath  1my master], saying, You shall not take a wife  for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in which I sojourned in  their land.

38. But unto the house  of my father you should go, and to  my tribe; and you shall take a wife  for my son.

39. And I said to my master, Perhaps [3should not go 1the 2woman] with me.

40. And he said to me, The lord  God in whom I was found well-pleasing before him, he will send out  his angel with you, and prosper  your way. And you will take a wife  for my son from out of  my tribe, and from out of the house  of my father.

41. Then [2innocent 1you will be] concerning  my oath. For when ever you should have come to  my tribe, and [2not 4to you 1they should 3give her], then you will be innocent concerning  my oath.

42. And coming today upon the spring, I said, O lord, the God  of my master Abraham; if you prosper  my way, in which now I go by it,

43. behold, I stand near the spring  of water, and the daughters of the men of the city came forth to draw water, and it will be the virgin to whom ever I should say, [4to drink 1Give me 5from  6your water-pitcher 2a little 3water]!

44. And she should have said to me, You also drink, and to your camels I will draw water. This is the woman whom the lord prepared  for his own attendant Isaac; and in this you will know that you have done mercy to my master Abraham.

45. And it came to pass before the completing my speaking in  my mind, straightway Rebekah came forth having the water-pitcher upon the shoulders, and she went down to the spring, and she drew water. And I said to her, Give me a drink!

46. And she hastened to lower the water-pitcher upon  her arm from herself, and she said, You drink! and  [2your camels 1I will water]. And I drank, and [2the 3camels 1she watered].

47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you?  And she said, [2the daughter 3of Bethuel 1I am], son of Nahor, whom [2bore 3to him 1Milcah]. And I put on her the ear-rings, and the bracelets about  her hands.

48. And finding favor, I did obeisance to the lord. And I blessed the lord  God  of my master Abraham, who prospered me in the way of truth, to take the daughter of the brother  of my master,  for his son.

49. If then you do mercy and righteousness to  my master, report to me that I might turn to the right or left!

50. And answering Laban and Bethuel said, From the lord came forth  this thing, we will not be able  to contradict bad or good.

51. Behold, Rebekah is before you, in taking her, run! and let her be wife to the son  of your master! as the lord spoke.

52. And taking place in the hearing of the servant  of Abraham  their words, he did obeisance upon the ground to the lord.

53. And [3brought forth 1the 2servant] items made of silver and of gold. And [2clothes 1he gave]  to Rebekah, and [2gifts 1he gave]  to her brother, and  to her mother.

54. And they ate and drank. And he and the men  [2with 3him 1being]  went to sleep. And rising up in the morning, he said, Send me forth! that I may go forth to  my master.

55. [5said 1And  2her brothers 3and  4mother], Let [3remain 1the 2virgin] with us [3days 1about 2ten]! and after this she shall go forth.

56. And he said to them, Do not hold me, for the lord prospered  my way! Send me! that I may go forth to  my master.

57. And they said, We should call the maidservant, and we should ask by her mouth.

58. And they called  Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with  this man?  And she said, I will go.

59. And they sent forth Rebekah  their sister, and  her possessions, and the servant  of Abraham, and the ones with him.

60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, [3sister 2our 1You are], become for a thousand myriads, and [2inherit  1let your seed] the cities of your opponents!

61. And rising up, Rebekah and  her handmaidens mounted upon the camels, and they went with the man. And taking the girl  Rebekah, he went forth.

62. And Isaac was traveling over through the wilderness by the Well of the Vision. And he dwelt in the land  towards the south.

63. And Isaac came forth to meditate in the plain towards afternoon. And looking up with  his eyes, he saw camels coming.

64. And Rebekah looking up with the eyes, saw  Isaac, and she leaped down from the camel.

65. And she said to the servant, Who is  that man  going in the plain to meet us? And said the servant, This  is my master. And she having taken the lightweight covering put it on.

66. And [3described 1the 2servant]  to Isaac all the words which he did.

67. [3entered 1And 2Isaac] into the house  of his mother, and took  Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted concerning Sarah  his mother.  

## Genesis 25

1.  Death of Abraham [3added 1And 2Abraham] to take a wife whose name was Keturah.

2. And she bore to him  Zimran, and  Jokshan, and  Medan, and  Midian, and  Ishbak, and  Shuah.

3. And Jokshan procreated  Sheba and  Dedan. And sons of Dedan were the Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

4. And the sons of Midian were Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah.

5. [3gave 1And 2Abraham] all  his possessions to Isaac  his son.

6. And to the sons  of his concubines Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them from Isaac  his son [2still 3living 1while he was] towards the east into the land of the east.

7. And these were the years of the days of the life of Abraham, as many as he lived, a hundred seventy-five years.

8. And failing, Abraham died in [2old age 1a good], an old man and full of days. And he was added to  his people.

9. And [4entombed 5him, 1Isaac 2and 3Ishmael]  [2two 3sons 1his], in the [2cave  1double], in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;

10. the field and the cave which Abraham acquired from the sons  of Heth. There they entombed Abraham and Sarah  his wife.

11. And it came to pass after the dying of Abraham, God blessed  Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by the Well of the Vision. 

12.  Generations of Ishmael And these are the origins of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whom Hagar bore (the Egyptian  maidservant of Sarah)  to Abraham.

13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, according to the names  of his generations. First-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

14. and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

15. and Hadar, and Tema, and Jetur, and Naphish, and Kedemah.

16. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of them by  their tents, and by  their properties -- twelve rulers according to their nation.

17. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred thirty-seven years; and failing, he died. And he was added to  his family.

18. And he dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, which is against the face of Egypt, unto coming to Assyrian. By the face of all  his brethren he dwelt. 

19.  Generations of Isaac And these are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham.

20. Abraham procreated  Isaac. [3was 1And 2Isaac 5years old 4forty] when he took  Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Syrian to himself for wife.

21. [3beseeched 1And 2Isaac] the lord concerning Rebekah  his wife, for she was sterile; [4listened 1and 2his  3God], and [3conceived 4in 5the womb 1Rebekah  2his wife].

22. [4leaped 1And 2the 3male babies] in her. And she said, If thus [3to me 1is about 2to happen], why [2to me 1is this]? And she went to inquire of the lord.

23. And the lord said to her, Two nations [2in 3your womb 1are]; and two peoples from out of  your belly will draw apart. And one people [2another people 1will be superior over]; and the greater will be a servant to the lesser.

24. And were fulfilled the days  for her to bear. And thus there were twins in  her belly.

25. And came forth the first-born fiery red entirely, and of [2skin 1hairy]. And she named  his name Esau.

26. And after this came forth  his brother, and  his hand took hold of the heel of Esau. And she called  his name Jacob. And Isaac was [2years old 1sixty] when [2bore 3them 1Rebekah].

27. [4grew 1And 2the 3young]. And Esau was a man knowing to hunt with hounds -- rugged; but Jacob [2man 1was a simple] living in a residence.

28. [3loved 1But 2Isaac]  Esau, for  his hunting food for him. But Rebekah loved  Jacob. 

29.  Esau Sells the Right of the First-born [3boiled 1And 2Jacob] stew; [3came 1and 2Esau] from out of the plains -- failing.

30. And Esau said  to Jacob, Let me taste from  [2stew 1this spicy] for I fail; on account of this [2was called  1his name] Edom.

31. [3said 1And 2Jacob]  to Esau, Give to me today  your rights as first-born.

32. And Esau said, Behold, I am going to come to an end, and what to me are these, the rights of the first-born?

33. And [2said 3to him 1Jacob], You swear by an oath to me today! And he swore by an oath to him. [3gave 1And 2Esau] the rights of the first-born  to Jacob.

34. And Jacob gave  to Esau bread and stew of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rising up he set out. And Esau treated as worthless the rights of the first-born.  

## Genesis 26

1.  Isaac Deceives Abimelech And there became a famine upon the land, separate from the famine  formerly, which happened in the time  of Abraham. [3went 1And 2Isaac] to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar.

2. [3appeared 1And 4to him 2the lord], and said, You should not go down into Egypt, but dwell in the land! which ever I should tell you.

3. And sojourn in  this land! And I will be with you, and I will bless you. For to you and  your seed I will give all  this land. And I will establish  my oath, which I swore  to Abraham  your father.

4. And I will multiply  your seed as the stars of the heaven. And I will give  your seed all  this land. And shall be blessed by  your seed all the nations of the earth;

5. because [3obeyed 1Abraham  2your father]  my voice, and guarded  my orders, and  my commandments, and  my ordinances, and  my laws.

6. [3dwelt 1And 2Isaac] in Gerar.

7. [6asked 1And 2the 3men 4of the 5place] concerning Rebekah  his wife. And he said, [2sister 1She is my], for he feared to say that, [2wife 1She is my], lest at any time [5should kill 6him 1the 2men 3of the 4place] on account of Rebekah; for [4beautiful 1her 2appearance 3was].

8. And he became long-lived there. And [5leaned over 1Abimelech 2the 3king 4of Gerar] through the window, and saw  Isaac playing with Rebekah  his wife.

9. [3called 1And 2Abimelech]  Isaac, and said to him, So indeed [2your wife 1is she]? Why is it that you said, [2sister 1She is my]? [3said 1And 4to him 2Isaac], I said it for lest at any time I might die on account of her.

10. [3said 1And 4to him 2Abimelech], What is this you did to us? Is it a small thing [4went to bed 1if someone  3kind 2of my] with  your wife, and you brought upon us a sin of ignorance?

11. [3gave orders 1And 2Abimelech] to all  his people, saying, Any one  touching  this man and  his wife [3unto death 2liable 1will be].

12. [3sowed 1And 2Isaac] in  that land. And he found in  that year [2bearing a hundred fold 1barley], [3blessed 1and 4him 2the lord].

13. And [3was exalted 1the 2man], and [2advancing 3greatly 1was], until of which time [3great 1he became 2exceedingly].

14. And there became to him herds of sheep, and herds of oxen, and [2farms 1many]. [4envied 1And 5him 2the 3Philistines]. 

15.  Combat Over the Wells And all the wells which [4dug 1the 2servants  3of his father] [3obstructed 4them 5in 6the 7time  8of his father 1the 2Philistines], and filled them with earth.

16. [3said 1And 2Abimelech] to Isaac, Go forth from us! for [3mightier than 4us 1you became 2exceedingly].

17. And Isaac went forth from there. And he rested up in the ravine of Gerar, and dwelt there.

18. And again Isaac dug the wells  of water which [5dug 1the 2servants 3of Abraham  4his father]; and [3obstructed 4them 1the 2Philistines], after the dying of Abraham  his father. And he named them with names according to the names which [2named  1his father].

19. And [4dug 1the 2servants 3of Isaac] in the ravine of Gerar, and found there a well of [2water 1living].

20. And [4did combat 1the 2shepherds 3of Gerar] with the shepherds of Isaac, maintaining [4theirs 3to be 1the 2water]. And they called the name of the well, Injustice, for they wronged him.

21. And departing from there he dug [2well 1another]. And they quarreled also on account of that well. And he named the name of it, Hatred.

22. And departing from there, he dug [2well 1another]. And they did not do combat over it. And he named the name of it, Expanse, saying, Because now the lord widened us, and caused us to grow upon the earth.

23. And he ascended from there towards the Well of the Oath.

24. And [2appeared 3to him 1the lord] in  that night, and said, I am the God of Abraham  your father. Do not fear! [3with 4you 1for 2I am]. And I will bless you, and I will multiply  your seed because of Abraham  your father.

25. And he built there an altar, and called upon the name of the lord, and he pitched there  his tent. [5dug 1And 7there 2the 3servants 4of Isaac 6a well] in the ravine Gerar. 

26.  Isaac's Covenant with Abimelech And Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath  his groomsman, and Phichol the commander-in-chief  of his force.

27. And [2said 3to them 1Isaac], Why did you come to me; for you detested me, and you sent me from you?

28. And they said, Seeing, we have seen that the lord was with you. And we said, Let there become an oath between us and between you! And we will ordain with you a covenant.

29. You shall not do [2with 3us 1evil], in so far as [2did not abhor 3you 1we], and which manner we treated you well, and we sent you out in peace. And now, you are being blessed by the lord.

30. And he made a banquet for them. And they ate and drank.

31. And rising up in the morning, [2swore by an oath 1each] to the neighbor. And [2sent them out 1Isaac], and they moved away from him with safety.

32. And it came to pass in  that day, also [4coming 1the 2servants 3of Isaac] reported to him concerning the well which they dug, and said, We did not find water.

33. And he called it, Oath. On account of this he called the name of that city, Well of Oath, unto  today's day.

34. [3was 1And 2Esau 5years old 4forty] and he took a wife -- Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and  Bashemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.

35. And they were contending with Isaac and  Rebekah.  

## Genesis 27

1.  Rebekah Deceives Isaac And it came to pass after the growing old  of Isaac, that [2were blunted  1his eyes]  to see. And he called Esau  [3son 1his  2older], and said to him, O my son. And he said, Behold, it is I.

2. And he said, Behold, I have grown old, and I do not know the day  of my decease.

3. Now then, take  your hunting equipment, both the quiver and the bow! and go forth into the plain, and hunt for me game!

4. And make for me food as I am fond of, and bring it to me! that I may eat, so that [2may bless 3you  1my soul] before  my dying.

5. And Rebekah heard Isaac speaking to Esau  his son. [3went 1And 2Esau] into the plain to hunt game  for his father.

6. And Rebekah said to Jacob  [3son 1her  2lesser], See! I heard  your father speaking to Esau  your brother, saying,

7. Bring to me game, and make food for me! that eating, I may bless you before the lord, before  my dying.

8. Now then, O my son, hear me as I give charge to you!

9. And going unto the sheep, you take for me from there two kids, tender and good! And I will make them for food  for your father as he is fond of.

10. And you shall carry them in to your father, and he shall eat, that [2may bless 3you  1your father] before  his dying.

11. [3said 1And 2Jacob] to Rebekah  his mother, [2is  1My brother 4man 3a hairy], and I am [2man 1a smooth];

12. lest at any time [2should handle 3me  1my father], and I will be before him as disdained, and I shall bring upon myself a curse, and not a blessing.

13. [4said 1And 5to him 2the 3mother], Upon me be  your curse, child. Only you heed my  voice! And in going bring them to me!

14. And going, he took them, and brought them to the mother. And [2made  1his mother] food as [2was fond of  1his father].

15. And Rebekah having taken the apparel of Esau  [3son 1her  2elder], the goodly, which was by her in the house, she put it on Jacob  [3son 1her  2younger].

16. And [2the 3skins 4of the 5kids 1she put] upon  his arms, and upon the naked parts  of his neck.

17. And she gave the foods and the bread loaves which she made unto the hands of Jacob  her son.

18. And he carried in to his father. And he said, Father!  And he said, Behold, it is I, who are you child? 

19.  Jacob Deceives Isaac And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau  your first-born. I did as you told me. In rising up come take a seat and eat from  my game! that [2may bless 3me  1your soul].

20. [3said 1And 2Isaac]  to his son, What is this which so quickly you found, O child?  And he said, that which [3delivered up 1the lord  2your God] before me.

21. [3said 1And 2Isaac]  to Jacob, Approach me, and I shall handle you child, to see if you are  my son Esau or not!

22. [3approached 1And 2Jacob] to Isaac  his father. And he handled him, and said, Indeed the voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

23. And he did not recognized him, [3were 1for  2his hands] as the hands of Esau  his brother -- hairy; and he blessed him.

24. And he said, You are  my son Esau?  And he said, I am. 

25.  Jacob's Blessing And he said, Bring to me! and I will eat from  your game, child, that [2may bless 3you  1my soul]. And he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he carried to him wine, and he drank.

26. And [3said 4to him 1Isaac  2his father], Approach me, and kiss me child!

27. And approaching, he kissed him. And he smelled the scent  of his garments, and blessed him, and said, Behold, the scent  of my son is as the scent [2field 1of a full] which the lord blessed;

28. and may [2give 3to you  1God] from the dew of the heaven, and from the fatness of the earth, and a multitude of grain and wine.

29. And let [2be slave 3to you 1nations]! And let [2do obeisance 3to you 1rulers]! And you become master  of your brother! And [4will do obeisance 5to you 1the 2sons  3of your father]. The one cursing you will be accursed, and the one blessing you will be for a blessing.

30. And it came to pass after the ceasing of Isaac blessing Jacob  his son, that it happened as Jacob went forth from the face of Isaac  his father, that Esau  his brother came from the hunt.

31. And he made also himself food, and brought it near  his father. And he said to the father, Rise up  my father, and eat from the game  of his son! that [2may bless 3me  1your soul].

32. And [3said 4to him 1Isaac  2his father], Who are you?  And he said, I am  your son, the first-born, Esau.

33. [3was amazed 1And 2Isaac 6change of state 5great 4with an exceedingly]. And he said, Who then is the one hunting game for me, and carrying it in to me? And I ate from all before  your coming, and blessed him, and a blessing let it be!

34. And it happened when Esau heard the words  of his father Isaac, he yelled out [5voice 1with a great 2and 4bitter 3exceedingly]. And he said, You bless indeed also me father!

35. And he said to him, In coming,  your brother with cunning took  your blessing.

36. And he said, Justly was [2called  1his name] Jacob. For he has stomped upon me already this second time. Even my rights of the first-born he has taken, and now he took  my blessing. And Esau said to his father, Do you not leave behind to me a blessing, O father?

37. And answering Isaac said  to Esau, If [3master 2him 1I made] of you, and [2all  3his brothers 1I made] his servants, [3with grain 4and 5wine 1to support 2him] -- then to you what may I do child?

38. [3said 1And 2Esau] to  his father, [2not 4blessing 3one 5in you 1Is there], O father? [2bless 1Indeed] me also father! [3being vexed 1And 2Isaac], [2yelled out 3a sound 1Esau], and he wept.

39. [4answering 1And 2Isaac  3his father] said to him, Behold, from the fatness of the earth will be  your dwelling, and from the dew of the heaven above.

40. And upon  your sword you shall live, and  [2of your brother 1you will be a servant]. And it will be when ever you should demolish and loosen  his yoke from  your neck. 

41.  Esau Seeks to Kill Jacob And Esau was angry  at Jacob on account of the blessing of which [2blessed 3him  1his father]. [3said 1And 2Esau] in  his mind, Let approach the days of the mourning  of my father! that I may kill Jacob  my brother.

42. And were reported to Rebekah the words of Esau  [3son 1her  2elder]. And sending forth, she called Jacob  [3son 1her  2younger], and she said to him, Behold, Esau,  your brother threatens you --  to kill you.

43. Now then, child, hear my  voice! and rising up run away into  Mesopotamia to Laban  my brother in Haran!

44. And live with him some days!

45. until the turning back the rage and the anger  of your brother from you, and he should forget what you have done to him. And sending, I will fetch you from there, lest at any time I should be childless from the two of you in [2day 1one].

46. [3said 1And 2Rebekah] to Isaac, I loathe  my life, on account of the daughters of the sons of Heth. If Jacob shall take a wife from the daughters  of this land, why is it for me  to live?  

## Genesis 28

1.  Jacob Sent to Laban [3having called 1And 2Isaac]  Jacob, blessed him, and gave charge to him, saying, Not shall you take a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites.

2. Having risen up, you run away unto  Mesopotamia to the house of Bethuel the father  of your mother! and take to yourself from there a wife from the daughters of Laban the brother  of your mother!

3.  And [2my God 1may 3bless] you, and increase you, and multiply you; and you will be for gatherings of nations.

4. And may he give to you the blessing of Abraham,  my father, to you, and  your seed after you; to inherit the land  of your sojourning, which God gave  to Abraham.

5. And Isaac sent  Jacob. And he went into  Mesopotamia to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

6. [3having seen 1And 2Esau] that Isaac blessed  Jacob, and sent him into  Mesopotamia of Syria to take to himself a wife from there -- in the blessing him, and gave charge to him, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of the Canaanites,

7. that Jacob hearkened to  [2father 3and  4mother 1his], and went into  Mesopotamia of Syria,

8. and seeing, even Esau, that [4are wicked 1the 2daughters 3of Canaan] before Isaac  his father,

9. that Esau went to Ishmael, and he took  Mahalath daughter of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, sister of Nebajoth, to  his wives, as a wife.

10. And Jacob went forth from the Well of the Oath, and went into Haran. 

11.  The Stairway to Heaven And he encountered a place, and slept there, [4went down 1for 2the 3sun]. And he took from one of the stones of the place, and put it at his head, and went to sleep in  that place.

12. And he dreamed. And behold, there was a stairway being supported by the earth, of which the top arrived in the heaven. And the angels  of God ascended and descended upon it.

13. And the lord stayed upon it. And he said, I am the God of Abraham  your father, and the God of Isaac. Do not fear! The land of which you sleep upon it, to you I will give it, and to your seed.

14. And [2will be  1your seed] as sand of the earth. And it will be widened unto the west, and south, and north, and unto the east. And shall be blessed by you all the tribes of the earth, and by  your seed.

15. And behold, I am with you, guarding you in  [2way 1every] of which ever you may go. And I will return you to  this land, for no way would I abandon you until  my doing all as much as I spoke to you.

16. And Jacob awoke from out of  his sleep. And he said that, The lord is in  this place, but I had not known it.

17. And he feared, and said, How fearful  this place. Is not this none other than the house of God, and this the gate  of heaven.

18. And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the stone which he placed there at his head. And he set it as a monument, and poured oil upon the top of it.

19. And he called the name  of that place, House of God, and Lam-luz was the name to the city  formerly.

20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If [3should be 1the lord  2God] with me, and should guard me in  this journey which I go, and should give to me bread to eat, and a cloak to put on,

21. and will return me with safety unto the house  of my father, and the lord will be to me for God,

22. and  this stone which I set as a monument, will be to me a house of God. And all, what ever, you should give to me, [2a tenth 1I will tithe] of it to you.  

## Genesis 29

1.  Jacob Meets Rachel and Laban And Jacob lifting his feet, went into the land of the east to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Syrian, and brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau.

2. And he saw, and behold, there was a well in the plain. And there were there three flocks of sheep resting near it, for from out of  that well they watered the flocks. [4stone 1And 2there was 3a great] upon the mouth of the well.

3. And [4came together 5there 1all 2the 3flocks]. And they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and they watered the sheep, and restored the stone upon the mouth of the well into  its place.

4. [3said 1And 4to them 2Jacob], Brethren, from what place are you?  And they said, [2from 3Haran 1We are].

5. And he said to them, You know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.

6. And he said to them, Is he in health? And they said, He is in health, and behold, Rachel  his daughter comes with the sheep.

7. And Jacob said, There is still [2day 1much], for not yet is the hour [3to come together 1for the 2herds]; having watered the sheep, sending them forth graze them!

8. And they said, We are not able until the coming together of all the shepherds, for they should roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, and we shall water the sheep.

9. While he was speaking to them, and behold, Rachel the daughter of Laban comes with the sheep  of her father. For she grazed the sheep  of her father.

10. And it came to pass as Jacob saw  Rachel, the daughter of Laban, brother  of his mother, and the sheep of Laban, the brother  of his mother; and coming forward, Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well. And he watered the sheep of Laban, the brother  of his mother.

11. And Jacob kissed  Rachel. And yelling  with his voice he wept.

12. And he reported  to Rachel that [2a brother  3of her father 1he is], and that [2a son 3of Rebekah 1he is]. And she ran to report  to her father concerning  these words.

13. And it came to pass as Laban heard the name Jacob, the son  of his sister, he ran to meet him. And taking hold of him, he kissed him and brought him into  his house. And he described to Laban all  these matters.

14. And [2said 3to him 1Laban], From out  of my bones, and from out  of my flesh are you. And he was with him a month of days.

15. [3said 1And 2Laban]  to Jacob that, For [2brother 1you are my], you shall not be a slave to me without charge, you tell to me what  your wage is? 

16.  Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel And to Laban there were two daughters, the name of the older -- Leah, and the name of the younger -- Rachel.

17. But the eyes of Leah were weak, but Rachel was good to the sight, and beautiful  in appearance -- exceedingly.

18. [3loved 1And 2Jacob]  Rachel. And he said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel  [3daughter 1your  2younger].

19. [3said 1And 4to him 2Laban], Better for me to give her to you, than for me to give her [2man 1to another]. You live with me!

20. And Jacob served for Rachel seven years, and they were before him as [2days 1a few], because of  his love for her.

21. [3said 1And 2Jacob]  to Laban, Give to me  my wife, [4are fulfilled 1for 2the 3days] so as to enter to her!

22. [3brought together 1And 2Laban] all the men of the place, and he made a wedding.

23. And it became evening. And taking Leah  his daughter, he brought her to Jacob, and [2entered 3to 4her 1Jacob].

24. [3gave 1And 2Laban] Leah  his daughter Zilpah  his maidservant.

25. And it happened in the morning, and behold, there was Leah. [3said 1And 2Jacob]  to Laban, What is this you did to me, was it not on account of Rachel I served for you, and why did you mislead me?

26. [3said 1And 2Laban], It is not so in  our place to give the younger before the elder.

27. You complete then  these sevenths and I will give to you also this woman for the work of which you will work for me, yet [2seven 3years 1another].

28. [3did 1And 2Jacob] so, and fulfilled  these her sevenths. And [2gave 3to him 1Laban] Rachel  his daughter, to him as wife.

29. [3gave 1And 2Laban  7to his daughter 4Bilhah 5the 6maidservant].

30. And he entered to Rachel. And he loved Rachel rather than Leah. And he served him [2seven 3years 1another]. 

31.  Leah Bears Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah [3seeing 1And 2the lord] that Leah was detested, he opened  her womb. But Rachel was sterile.

32. And Leah conceived and bore a son  to Jacob. And she called  his name, Reuben, saying, Because [2saw 3my 1the lord] the humiliation, and he gave to me a son; now then [2will love 3me  1my husband].

33. And [3conceived 1again 2Leah] and bore [2son 1a second]  to Jacob. And she said, For the lord heard that I am detested, and he gave in addition to me also this one. And she called  his name, Simeon.

34. And she conceived again and bore a son. And she said, In the present time [3by 4me 2will be  1my husband], for I bore to him three sons. On account of this she called  his name, Levi.

35. And conceiving again she bore a son. And she said, Now yet this I will acknowledge to the lord. On account of this she called  his name, Judah. And she stopped  bearing.  

## Genesis 30

1.  Bilhah Bears Dan and Naphtali [3saw 1And 2Rachel] that she has not borne  to Jacob. And Rachel envied  her sister. And she said  to Jacob, Give to me a child! and if not, I will come to an end.

2. [3being enraged 1And 2Jacob]  with Rachel, said to her, [3not 4in place 5of God 1I 2am] who deprived you of the fruit of the belly?

3. [3said 1And 2Rachel]  to Jacob, Behold,  my maidservant Bilhah. Enter to her! and she will bear upon  my knees, and [2will produce children 1even I] from her.

4. And she gave Bilhah to him --  her maidservant to him as wife. And [2entered 3to 4her 1Jacob].

5. And [5conceived 1Bilhah 2the 3maidservant 4of Rachel]. And she bore  to Jacob a son.

6. And Rachel said, [2judged 3me  1God], and he heeded  my voice, and he gave to me a son through this one. On account of this she called  his name, Dan.

7. And [5conceived 6again 1Bilhah 2the 3maidservant 4of Rachel]. And she bore [2son 1a second]  to Jacob.

8. And Rachel said, [2aided 3me  1God], and I was twisted by my sister, and I was able. And she called  his name, Naphtali. 

9.  Zilpah Bears Gad and Asher [3saw 1And 2Leah] that she stopped  bearing. And she took Zilpah  her maidservant, and gave her  to Jacob as wife.

10. And [5conceived 1Zilpah 2the 3maidservant 4of Leah]. And she bore  to Jacob a son.

11. And Leah said, I am in good luck. And she named  his name, Gad.

12. And [5conceived 6again 1Zilpah 2the 3maidservant 4of Leah]. And she bore  to Jacob [2son 1a second].

13. And Leah said, Blessed am I, for [3declare me happy 1the 2women]. And she called  his name, Asher. 

14.  Leah Bears Issachar, Zebulun, and Dinah [3went 1And 2Reuben] in the day [2harvest 1of the wheat], and he found apples of mandrakes in the field. And he brought them to Leah  his mother. [3said 1And 2Rachel]  to Leah  her sister, Give to me of the mandrakes  of your son!

15. [3said 1And 2Leah], Is it not fit to you that you took  my man, shall also [2of the 3mandrakes  4of my son 1you take]? [3said 1And 2Rachel], Not so, let him go to bed with you  this night in return for the mandrakes  of your son.

16. [3entered 1And 2Jacob] from out of the field at evening. And came forth Leah to meet him. And she said, [2to 3me 1You shall enter] today, for I have hired you in return for the mandrakes  of my son. And he went to bed with her  that night.

17. And God heeded Leah. And conceiving, she bore [2son 1a fifth] to Jacob.

18. And Leah said, [2gave 3to me  1God]  my wage because I gave  my maidservant  to my husband. And she called  his name, Issachar, which is, Wage.

19. And [2conceived 3again 1Leah]. And she bore [2son 1a sixth]  to Jacob.

20. And Leah said, God has presented to me [2gift 1a good] in the present time, [2will select me  1my man] for having borne to him six sons. And she called  his name, Zebulun.

21. And after this she bore a daughter, and she called  her name, Dinah. 

22.  Rachel Bears Joseph [3remembered 1And  2God]  Rachel. And [2heeded 3her  1God], and he opened her  womb.

23. And conceiving, she bore  to Jacob a son. [3said 1And 2Rachel], God removed from me the scorn.

24. And she called  his name Joseph, saying, God added to me [2son 1another]!

25. And it came to pass when Rachel bore  Joseph, Jacob said  to Laban, Send me that I may go forth into  my place, and unto  my land!

26. Give to me  my wives, and  my children! for whom I have served to you, that I might go forth. For you know the servitude which I have served you.

27. [3said 1And 4to him 2Laban], If I found favor before you, could I foretell even -- [2blessed 3me  1God] in your entrance.

28. You draw  your wage from me! and I will give it.

29. [3said 1And 2Jacob] to him, You know in what I served you, and how much [3was 2cattle 1of your] with me.

30. [3little 1For 2there was] as much as was to you before me, and it was grown into a multitude; and [2blessed 3you 1the lord] by  my foot. Now then, when shall [2produce 1I also] for myself a house?

31. And Laban said to him, What shall I give to you? [3said 1And 4to him 2Jacob], You shall not give to me anything. If you should do for me  this word, again I will tend  your flocks, and guard them. 

32.  Jacob's Wage Let [3go by 1all  2your flocks] today, and you part from there every [2sheep 1gray] among the rams, and all white-mixed and speckled among the goats! It will be to me a wage.

33. And [2will take heed 3to me  1my righteousness] in the [2day  1next]; for [2is  1my wage] before you -- all which might not be speckled and white-mixed among the goats, and gray among the rams, [2stolen 1will be as] by me.

34. [3said 1And 4to him 2Laban], Let it be according to  your word!

35. And he drew apart in  that day the [2he-goats  1speckled], and the white-mixed, and all the goats, the speckled and the white-mixed, and all gray, the one which was among the rams. And he gave by the hand  of his sons.

36. And he left a journey of three days between them and between Jacob. And Jacob tended the flocks of Laban -- the ones left behind.

37. [3took 1And 4to himself 2Jacob] a rod [2poplar 1of green], and of walnut, and of the plane tree. And [2peeled 3them 1Jacob 5peels 4into white], tearing away the green. And there appeared upon the rods the white which he peeled -- varying.

38. And he placed the rods which he peeled at the watering troughs of the channels of the water. That whenever [3came 1the 2flocks] to drink in front of the rods of those having come to  drink, the rods should stimulate the flocks at the rods.

39. And [3bore 1the 2flocks] white-mixed, and colored, and ashen speckled.

40. [4the 1And 5lambs 3drew apart 2Jacob]. And he set [3before 4the 5sheep 1a ram 2white-mixed], and every colored one among the lambs. And he parted to himself flocks for himself, and did not mix them into the flocks of Laban.

41. And it came to pass in the time [3which 4he stimulated 1the 2flocks] in the womb, [2taking them 3put 1Jacob] the rods before the flocks at the watering troughs for the purpose of stimulating them by the rods.

42. But whenever [3bore 1the 2flocks] he did not place them. [4became 1And 2the 3unmarked]  Laban's, and the marked  Jacob's.

43. And [3became rich 1the 2man] exceedingly, exceedingly. And there was to him [2cattle 1much], and oxen, and manservants, and maidservants, and camels, and donkeys.  

## Genesis 31

1.  Jacob's Flight from Laban [3heard 1And 2Jacob] the utterances of the sons of Laban, saying, Jacob has taken all the things  of our father. And by the things  of our father he has produced all  this glory.

2. And Jacob saw the face  of Laban; and behold, he was not for him as yesterday and the third day before.

3. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Jacob, Return to the land  of your father, and to  your family! and I will be with you.

4. [3sending 1And 2Jacob], called Leah and Rachel to the plain where [3were 1the 2flocks].

5. And he said to them, I see the face  of your father, that it is not towards me as yesterday and the third day before. But the God  of my father was with me.

6. [2also 3you yourselves 1But] know that with all  my strength I have served to your father.

7.  But your father cheated me, and bartered  my wage for the ten lambs. And [4did not 5give 6to him 1the 2God  3of my father] the power to do evil against me.

8. If thus he should have said, The colored will be your wage, then [4would bear 1all 2the 3flocks] colored. And if he should have said, The white will be your wage, then [4would bear 1all 2the 3flocks] white.

9. And God removed all the herds  of your father, and he gave them to me.

10. And it came to pass when [3were stimulated 1the 2flocks], in the womb conceiving, that I saw [2with 3my eyes 1them] in  sleep. And behold, the he-goats and the rams ascended upon the flocks, and the she-goats white-mixed and colored and ashen speckled.

11. And [4said 5to me 1the 2angel  3of God] during sleep, Jacob. And I said, What is it?

12. And he said, Look up with your eyes, and see the he-goats and the rams ascending upon the flocks, and the she-goats -- white-mixed and colored and ashen speckled! For I have seen as much as [3to you 1Laban 2does].

13. I am  God, the one appearing to you in the place of God, of which you anointed to me there a monument, and vowed to me there a vow. Now then, rise up and go forth from out of  this land! And go forth into the land  of your birth!

14. And answering Rachel and Leah said to him, Is there not to us still a portion or inheritance in the house  of our father?

15. Are we not [2as 3the 4aliens 1considered] to him? For he has sold us, and by eating up a thing devoured  our silver.

16. All the riches and the glory which [4removed 1the 2God  3of our father] will be ours and  our children's. Now then as much as [2has said to you  1God], you do!

17. [3rising up 1And 2Jacob], took  his wives, and  his children upon the camels.

18. And he took away all  his possessions, and all  his belongings, which he procured in  Mesopotamia, and all his things to go forth to Isaac  his father, in the land of Canaan.

19. And Laban set out to shear  his flocks, [3stole 1and 2Rachel] the idols  of her father.

20. [3hid the fact from 1And 2Jacob] Laban the Syrian,  so as not to announce to him that he is running away.

21. And he ran away, himself and  all of his. And he passed over the river, and he advanced unto the mountain of Gilead.

22. And it was announced to Laban the Syrian on the [2day  1third] that Jacob ran away.

23. And taking all the ones of his brethren with himself, he pursued after him [3journey 2days 1seven]. And he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.

24. [3came 1And  2God] to Laban the Syrian during sleep in the night, and he said to him, Guard! lest at any time you should speak [2against 3Jacob 1evil]. 

25.  Laban Quarrels with Jacob And Laban overtook  Jacob. And Jacob pitched  his tent in the mountain. And Laban stationed  his brethren in the mountain of Gilead.

26. [3said 1And 2Laban]  to Jacob, What did you do? Why did you secretly run away, and ransacked me, and took away  my daughters as captives taken by sword?

27. For if you announced to me, I would have sent out even you with gladness, and with music, and tambourines, and harps.

28. And not am I worthy to kiss  my children, and  my daughters. Now then [2unwisely 1you acted].

29. And now [2is strong  1my hand] to do evil against you. But the God  of your father yesterday said to me, saying, Guard yourself! lest at any time you should speak [2against 3Jacob 1evil].

30. Now then, you go! For with desire you desired to go forth unto the house  of your father; why did you steal  my gods?

31. And answering Jacob said  to Laban, For I said, Lest at any time you should remove  your daughters from me, and all  my things.

32. And Jacob said, By whomsoever you should find  your gods, he shall not live before  our brethren. Recognize what is from me of the things of yours, and take them! And he did not recognize among what was his -- not one thing. [3did not 4know 1But 2Jacob] that Rachel  his wife stole them.

33. And entering, Laban searched in the house of Leah, and he did not find. And he came forth from out of the house of Leah, and he searched the house of Jacob, and in the house of the two maidservants, and he did not find. And he entered also into the house of Rachel.

34. And Rachel took the idols, and put them in the packsaddles of the camel, and sat on them.

35. And she said  to her father, Do not [2heavily 1bear], O master, I shall not be able to rise up before you, for the  custom  of women is to me. [3searched 1And 2Laban] in the entire  house, and he did not find the idols.

36. [3was provoked to anger 1And 2Jacob], and he quarreled with Laban. And responding Jacob said  to Laban, What is  my offence? and what is  my sin, that you pursued after me?

37. and that you searched all the items  of my house? What did you find from all the items  of your house? Put here before  your brethren and  my brethren, and let them reprove between the two of us!

38. These  twenty years I am with you;  your flocks and  your goats were not barren, and the rams  of your flocks I did not eat.

39. That taken by wild beasts I have not brought to you. I paid for them by myself, even thefts by day, and thefts by night.

40. I was  [4by day 1burning with 2the 3sweltering heat], and with the icy coldness of the night. And [3departed  2sleep 1my] from  my eyes.

41. These  twenty years I am in  your residence. I served you fourteen years for  [2two 3daughters 1your], and six years among  your sheep, and you cheated  my wage by ten ewe-lambs.

42. Unless the God  of my father Abraham, and the fear of Isaac was with me, now then would [2me empty 1you have sent].  My humiliation and the toil  of my hands God saw, and he reproved you yesterday.

43. And responding Laban said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the cattle my cattle; and all as much as you see is mine, and the property of my daughters. What shall I do with these women today or the children of them whom they bore? 

44.  Laban and Jacob Make a Covenant Now then, come here, we should ordain a covenant, I and you, and it will be a testimony between me and you.

45. [3taking 1And 2Jacob] a stone, established it as a monument;

46. [3said 1And 2Jacob] to his brethren, Collect together stones! And they collected together stones. And they made a hill. And they ate there upon the hill.

47. And [2called 3it 1Laban], Hill of the Witness, but Jacob called it, The Hill is Witness.

48. [3said 1And 2Laban],  this hill witnesses between me and you today. Because of this [5was called 1the 2name 3of the 4place], Hill Witnesses.

49. And the vision, which he said, Let God look between me and you, is that we will leave the other from the other.

50. If you shall humble  my daughters, if you should take wives over  my daughters, you see no one [2with 3us 1is] seeing --  God is witness between me and between you.

51. And Laban said  to Jacob, Behold,  this hill, and the monument which I stood between me and you;

52. [2witnesses  1this hill], and the monument which I stood -- it witnesses. For if I pass over, I to you, neither shall you pass over to me  beyond this hill and  this monument, for evil.

53. The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor judges between us.

54. And Jacob swore by an oath according to the fear  of his father Isaac. And he sacrificed a sacrifice in the mountain, and he called  his brethren; and they ate and drank, and they went to sleep in the mountain.

55. [3rising up 1And 2Laban] in the morning, kissed the sons and  daughters of his, and he blessed them. And Laban turned and went forth to  his place.  

## Genesis 32

1.  Jacob Fears Esau And Jacob went forth into  his own way. And having looked up, he saw the camp of God encamped. And [4met with 5him 1the 2angels  3of God].

2. [3said 1And 2Jacob], when he saw them, [2the camp 3of God 1This is]. And he called the name  of that place, Camps.

3. [3sent 1And 2Jacob] messengers in front of him to Esau  his brother, into the land of Seir into the region of Edom.

4. And he gave charge to them, saying, Thus you shall say to my master Esau; Thus says  your servant Jacob, [2with 3Laban 1I sojourned], and passed time until the present.

5. And came to me oxen, and donkeys, and sheep, and manservants, and maidservants. And I sent to announce to my master Esau, that [2might find  1your servant] favor before you.

6. And [3returned 1the 2messengers] to Jacob, saying, We came to  your brother Esau. And behold, he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him.

7. [3feared 1And 2Jacob] exceedingly, and he was perplexed. And he divided the people, the one with himself, and the oxen, and the sheep into two camps.

8. And Jacob said, If Esau should come into [2camp 1one] and should smite it, [4will be 1the 3camp  2second] for  delivering.

9. [3said 1And 2Jacob], The God  of my father Abraham, and the God  of my father Isaac, O lord, the one saying to me, Run to the land  of your birth! and [2good 3to you 1I will do].

10. It is fit to me for all righteousness, and of all truth, of which you did to your servant; for with  [2my rod 1this] I passed over  this Jordan, and now I exist in two camps.

11. Rescue me from the hand  of my brother, from the hand of Esau! For I fear him, lest coming he should strike me, and the mother with children.

12. But you, you said, [3good 2you 1I will do], and I will establish  your seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be counted by the multitude.

13. And he went to sleep there  that night. And he took [2of which 3he brought 1gifts], and he sent to Esau  his brother;

14. goats -- two hundred; he-goats -- twenty; sheep -- two hundred; rams -- twenty;

15. camels nursing and  their offspring -- thirty; oxen -- forty; bulls -- ten; donkeys -- twenty; and foals -- ten.

16. And he gave them by hand to his servants a flock alone. And he said to his servants, You go forth in front of me, and [2a space 1make] between flock and flock.

17. And he gave charge to the first, saying, If [3should meet you 1Esau  2my brother], and he should ask you, saying, Who are you? and where might you go? and who are these  going before you?

18. You shall say,  Your servant Jacob [2gifts 1has sent] to my master Esau. And behold, he is behind us.

19. And he gave charge to the first, and to the second, and to the third, and to all the ones going before behind  these flocks, saying, According to  this saying you speak to Esau when  you find him!

20. And you shall say, Behold,  your servant Jacob comes after us. For he said, I will appease  his face by the gifts  going before him; and after this I will see  his countenance, for perhaps he will favorably receive  my person.

21. And [3went before 1the 2gifts]  his face. And he went to sleep  that night in the camp.

22. And rising  that night, he took the two wives, and the two maidservants, and the eleven children of his, and he passed over the ford of the Jabbok.

23. And he took them, and passed over the rushing stream, and he caused to pass over all the ones of his. 

24.  Jacob Wrestles with God [3was left behind 1And 2Jacob] alone, and [2wrestled 1a man] with him until morning.

25. And he saw that he was not able to prevail against him; and he touched the wide part  of his thigh, and he paralyzed the wide part of the thigh of Jacob in  his wrestling with him.

26. And he said to him, You send me away! [4ascended 1for 2the 3dawn].  And he said, No way will I send you away if [2not 4me 1you should 3bless].

27. And he said to him, What  [3name 2your 1is]?  And he said, Jacob. 

28.  Jacob's Name Changed to Israel And he said to him, [3not 2shall 5be called 4any longer  1your name] Jacob, but Israel will be  your name; for you grew in strength against God, and against [2men 1mighty].

29. [3asked 1And 2Jacob] and said, Announce to me  your name! And he said, Why is this you ask  my name, which is wonderful? And he blessed him there.

30. And Jacob called the name  of that place, Sight of God. For I saw  God face to face, and [3was delivered 1my  2life].

31. [4arose 1And 5to him 2the 3sun] when he went by the form  of God, but he was limping in his thigh.

32. Because of this, no way [4eat 1do the 2sons 3of Israel] the nerve by which he was paralyzed, which is upon the wide part of the thigh, until  this day. For he touched the wide part of the thigh of Jacob, of the nerve, in which he was paralyzed.  

## Genesis 33

1.  Jacob and Esau Reunite [3looking up 1And 2Jacob] saw. And behold, Esau  his brother was coming, and four hundred men with him. And Jacob divided the servants unto Leah and unto Rachel, and the two maidservants.

2. And he made the two maidservants and  their sons go in first, and Leah and  her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last.

3. But he went forth in front of them, and did obeisance on the ground seven times, while approaching to his brother.

4. And Esau ran up to meet him. And taking hold of him, he kissed him. And he fell upon  his neck. And he kissed him, and they [2wept 1both].

5. And Esau looking up, he saw the women and the children. And he said, What [2these 3to you 1are]?  And he said, The children which God showed mercy on  your servant.

6. And [5drew near 1the 2maidservants 3and  4their children], and did obeisance.

7. And Leah drew near and  her children, and they did obeisance. And after this [4drew near 1Rachel 2and 3Joseph], and they did obeisance.

8. And he said, What [2these 3to you 1are], all  these camps which I have met?  And he said, that [2should find  1your servant] favor before you, O master.

9. [3said 1And 2Esau], There is to me much, O brother, let [3be 4yours 2things 1your]!

10. [3said 1And 2Jacob], If I found favor before you, take the gifts by  my hands! Because of this I saw  your face, as if one may have seen the face of God, and you shall think well of me.

11. Take the things of my blessing, which I brought to you! for [2showed mercy 3on me  1God], and there is to me all things. And he forced him, and he took.

12. And he said, Departing we will go  straight.

13. And he said to him,  My master knows that the children are tender, and the sheep and the oxen are giving birth to me. If then I should drive them [2day 1one more 6will die 3all 4the 5cattle].

14. Let [2go forth  1my master] in front of  his servant! and I shall gain strength in the way according to the ease of the trek  before me, and according to the foot of the youngsters, until  my coming to  my master in Seir.

15. [3said 1And 2Esau], I will leave behind with you some of the people of the ones with me.  And he said, Why this? It is enough that I found favor before you, O lord.

16. [3returned 1And 2Esau] in  that day unto  his journey to Seir.

17. And Jacob departed to Tents. And he made himself there a residence, and  [3for his cattle 1he made 2tented shelters]. On account of this they call the name  of that place, Tents.

18. And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he returned back from  Mesopotamia Syria. And he camped before the face of the city.

19. And he acquired the portion of the field which sat there  by his tent, from Hamor father of Shechem, for a hundred lambs.

20. And he set up there an altar, and called upon the God of Israel.  

## Genesis 34

1.  Dinah is Humbled by Shechem And went forth Dinah, the daughter whom Leah bore  to Jacob, to study the daughters of the native inhabitants.

2. And [2beheld 3her 1Shechem], the son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of the land. And taking her, he went to bed with her, and humbled her.

3. And he took heed to the soul of Dinah the daughter of Jacob. And he loved the virgin, and he spoke concerning the thought  of her virgin state.

4. And said Shechem to Hamor  his father, saying, Take for me  this maidservant for a wife.

5. And Jacob heard that [4defiled 1the 2son 3of Hamor] Dinah  his daughter.  But his sons were with  his cattle in the plain. [3remained silent 1And 2Jacob] until  they came.

6. And came forth Hamor the father of Shechem to Jacob to speak to him.

7. And the sons of Jacob came from the plain. And as they heard, [3were vexed 1the 2men], and it was distressing to them exceedingly. For [2an indecent act 1he did] in Israel, going to bed with the daughter of Jacob. And not thus shall it be.

8. And Hamor spoke to them, saying, Shechem  my son prefers [2in his 3soul  1your daughter]. Give her then to him as wife!

9. And be allied by marriage to us!  [3your daughters 1You give 2us], and  [2our daughters 1you take]  for your sons!

10. And [2with 3us 1dwell]! And the land -- behold, it is spacious before you; you dwell and do trade in it, and acquire possessions in it!

11. [3said 1And 2Shechem] to  her father, and to  her brothers, I want to find favor before you, and what ever you should have said we will give.

12. You multiply the dowry exceedingly! and I will give in so far as whatever you should have said to me. And you shall give to me  this child as wife. 

13.  Treachery of Jacob's Sons [5responded 1And 2the 3sons 4of Jacob]  to Shechem and Hamor  his father with treachery. And they spoke to them, for they defiled Dinah  their sister.

14. And said to them Simeon and Levi the brothers of Dinah, We shall not be able to do  this matter, to give  our sister to a man who has a foreskin, for it is scorn to us.

15. Only in this we will be like you, and dwell among you, if you should become as us and we you, in the circumcision [3of yours 1of every 2male].

16. And we will give  our daughters to you, and from  your daughters we will take to ourselves wives, and we will live by you, and we will be [2race 1one].

17. But if you should not listen to us, of the being circumcised, taking  our daughter, we shall go forth.

18. And [3were pleasing 1the 2words] before Hamor, and before Shechem the son of Hamor.

19. And [3did not 4pass time 1the 2young man]  to do  this word, for he clung to the daughter of Jacob. And he was most honorable of all of the ones in the house  of his father.

20. [6came 1And 2Hamor 3and 4Shechem  5his son] to the gate  of their city, and spoke to the men  of their city, saying,

21.  These men are peaceable with us; let them live upon the land, and let them trade in it! And the land, behold, it is spacious before them;  [4of their daughters 1we shall take 2to ourselves 3wives], and  [2daughters 1we shall give our] to them.

22. In this only will [3be like 4us 1the 2men],  to dwell with us, so as to be [2people 1one] -- in the being circumcised of us every male, as also they have been circumcised.

23. And  their cattle, and the four-footed animals, and  their possessions -- [2not 4ours 1will they 3be]? Only in this, should we be like them, and they will live with us.

24. And they listened to Hamor and Shechem  his son, and all the ones going forth at the gate  of their city. And they were circumcised in the flesh  of their foreskin -- every male.

25. And it came to pass in the [2day  1third], when they were in  misery, [11taking 1the 2two 3sons 4of Jacob 5Simeon 6and 7Levi 8brothers 9of Dinah 10each]  his sword, even entered to the city safely, and killed every male.

26.  Also Hamor and Shechem  his son they killed by the mouth of the sword. And they took  Dinah from the house  of Shechem, and went forth.

27. And the sons of Jacob entered unto the wounded, and plundered the city in which [3was defiled 1Dinah  2their sister].

28. And  their sheep, and  their oxen, and  their donkeys, as much as was in the city, and as much as was in the plain, they took.

29. And all  their persons, and all  their belongings, and  their women they captured. And they plundered as much as was in the city, and as much as was in the houses.

30. [3said 1And 2Jacob] to Simeon and Levi, [2me detested 1You have made], so as [3wicked 1for me 2to be] to all the ones dwelling the land, among both the Canaanites and among the Perizzites. And I am very few in number. And gathering against me, they shall cut me down, and I shall be obliterated, I and  my house.

31.  And they said, But as a harlot they treated  our sister.  

## Genesis 35

1.  Jacob Builds an Altar at Beth-el [3said 1And  2God] to Jacob, Rising up, ascend unto the place Beth-el! And live there, and make there an altar  to God! to the one appearing to you in the running away from the face of Esau  your brother.

2. [3said 1And 2Jacob]  to his house, and to all the ones with him, Take away  [3gods 1the 2alien] from your midst, and cleanse and change  your robes!

3. And rising up, let us ascend unto Beth-el, and let us make there an altar  to God! to the one taking heed of me in the day of affliction, who was with me, and preserved me in the way which I went.

4. And they gave  to Jacob  [3gods 1the 2alien], which were in  their hands, and the ear-rings  in  their ears. And [2hid 3them 1Jacob] under the turpentine tree, the one in Shechem. And he destroyed them unto  today's day.

5. And Israel lifted away from Shechem. And there was a fear of God upon the cities  round about them. And they did not pursue after the sons of Israel.

6. [3came 1And 2Jacob] into Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, which is Beth-el, he and all the people who were with him.

7. And he built there an altar, and he called the name of the place, Beth-el, for there [2appeared 3to him  1God] in  his running away from the face of Esau  his brother.

8. [6died 1And 2Deborah 3the 4nurse 5of Rebekah], and they entombed her below Beth-el, under the acorn tree, and Jacob called the name of it, Acorn tree of Mourning. 

9.  God Changes Jacob's Name to Israel [3appeared 1And  2God]  to Jacob still in Luz, when he came from out of Mesopotamia  of Syria. And [2blessed 3him  1God].

10. And [2said 3to him  1God],  Your name shall not be called any longer Jacob, but Israel will be  your name. And he called  his name Israel.

11. [3said 1And 4to him  2God], I am  your God. Grow and multiply! Nations and gatherings of nations will be from you, and kings [2from  3your loin 1shall come forth].

12. And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, [3to you 1I give 2it]. And to your seed after you I shall give  this land.

13. [3ascended 1And  2God] from him, from the place where he spoke with him.

14. And Jacob set up a monument in the place in which [2spoke 3with 4him  1God] -- [2monument 1a stone]. And he offered upon it a libation, and he poured upon it olive oil.

15. And Jacob called the name of the place in which [2spoke 3with 4him 5there  1God], Beth-el. 

16.  Death of Rachel [3departed 1And 2Jacob] from Beth-el, and he pitched  his tent beyond the tower of Gader. And it came to pass when he approached Chabratha,  to come into  Ephrath, Rachel bore. And in the giving birth she suffered birth pangs.

17. And it came to pass in  her harshly bearing, [3said 4to her 1the 2midwife], Be of courage! for also this [3to you 1is 2a son].

18. And it came to pass in  her letting go the soul, for she was dying, she called  his name, Son of my Grief;  but the father called  his name, Benjamin.

19. [3died 1And 2Rachel], and she was entombed in the way of Ephrath, this is Beth-lehem.

20. And Jacob set up a monument for  her memorial. This is the monument upon the tomb of Rachel, until  this day.

21. And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in  that land, Reuben went and bedded with Bilhah, the concubine  of his father Jacob. And Israel heard, and [2wicked 1it appeared] before him. 

22.  Generations of Jacob and the Death of Isaac [5were 1And 2the 3sons 4of Jacob] twelve.

23. The sons of Leah, the first-born of Jacob, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun.

24. And the sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin.

26. And the sons of Zilpah the maidservant of Leah, Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, the ones who were born to him in Mesopotamia  of Syria.

27. [3came 1And 2Jacob] to Isaac  his father in Mamre, in a city of the plain -- this is Hebron, in the land of Canaan, where [4sojourned 1Abraham 2and 3Isaac].

28. And were the days of Isaac which he lived, [3years 1a hundred 2eighty].

29. And failing, Isaac died. And he was added to  his family, older and full of days. And [7entombed 8him 1Esau 2and 3Jacob  5two 6sons 4his].

And Esau went from the land of Canaan, from the face of Jacob  his brother.

## Genesis 37

1.  Joseph's Dreams [3dwelt 1And 2Jacob] in the land of which [2sojourned  1his father] in the land of Canaan.

2. These are the generations of Jacob. And Joseph [2ten 3and 4seven 5years old 1was] tending the sheep  of his father with  his brothers, being young among the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, the wives  of his father. And they brought against Joseph [2fault 1a bad] to Israel  their father.

3. But Jacob loved  Joseph beyond all  his sons, for [3the son 4of old age 1he was 2to him]. And he made for him [2garment 1a colored].

4. [3seeing 1And  2his brothers] that [4him 1the 2father 3was fond of] over all  of his sons, they detested him, and were not able to speak to him, not one thing peaceable.

5. [3dreaming 1And 2Joseph] a dream, reported it to his brothers.

6. And he said to them, Hear  this dream which I dreamed!

7. I imagined you all were binding sheaves in the middle of the plain. And there rose up  my sheaf, and it was straight up. [4moving around 1And  3sheaves 2your], did obeisance to  my sheaf.

8. [3said 1And 4to him  2his brothers], Do you mean in reigning you will reign over us, or in dominating you will dominate us? And they added still to detest him because of  his dreams, and because of  his words.

9. And he saw [2dream 1another]. And he described it to his father, and to his brothers. And he said, Behold, I dreamed [2dream 1another]; as if the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars did obeisance to me.

10. And [2reproached 3him  1his father], and said to him, What  is this dream which you dreamed? Is it so indeed in having come I will come also, and  your mother, and  your brothers, to do obeisance to you upon the ground?

11. [3envied 1And 4him  2his brothers],  but his father kept the saying.

12. [3went 1And  2his brothers] to graze the sheep  of their father in Shechem.

13. And Israel said to Joseph, Did not  your brothers tend in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Behold, I am ready.

14. [3said 1And 4to him 2Israel], In going see if [2are in health  1your brothers] and the sheep, and announce it to me! And he sent him from the valley  of Hebron. And he came into Shechem.

15. And [2found 3him 1a man] wandering in the plain. [4asked 1And 5him 2the 3man], saying, What do you seek?

16.  And he said,  [2my brothers 1I seek]; report to me where they graze!

17. [4said 1And 5to him 2the 3man], They have departed from here. For I heard them saying, Let us go unto Dothan. And Joseph went after  his brothers, and found them in Dothan. 

18.  Joseph Sold into Egypt And they spied him far off before  his approaching to them. And they acted wickedly  to kill him.

19. And said each to  his brother, Behold,  that dreamer comes.

20. Now then, come, let us kill him and toss him into one of the wells! And we shall say, [2wild beast 1A ferocious] devoured him. And we shall see what will be  of his dreams.

21. [3hearing 1And 2Reuben], rescued him from out of  their hands. And he said, Do not strike him as far as his life.

22. [3said 1And 4to them 2Reuben], You should not shed blood, put him into one  of these wells of the ones in the wilderness, [4a hand 1and 3not 2bear] against him, that he might rescue him from out of  their hands, and that he might give him to his father.

23. And it came to pass when Joseph came to  his brothers, they took [4off 5Joseph  3garment 1the 2colored], the one around him.

24. And taking him, they tossed him into the well. But the well was empty, [3water 1it did not 2have].

25. And they sat to eat bread. And looking up with the eyes they saw. And behold, journeying Ishmaelites having come from Gilead, and  their camels full of incenses, and balm, and balsam. And they were going leading down into Egypt.

26. [3said 1And 2Judah] to  his brothers, What profit if we kill  our brother, and hide  his blood?

27. Come let us give him  to these Ishmaelites, and the hands of ours, let them not be upon him! for he is our brother, and [2flesh 1he is our]. [3hearkened 1And  2his brothers].

28. And [2came near  1the men], the Midianite merchants, and they drew out and hauled  Joseph from out of the well. And [3rendered  4for Joseph 1the 2Ishmaelites] twenty pieces of gold. And they led  Joseph into Egypt.

29. [3returned 1And 2Ruben] upon the well, and he did not see  Joseph in the well, and he tore  his clothes.

30. And he turned towards  his brothers, and he said, The boy is not, and I, where shall I go yet?

31. And taking the garment  of Joseph, they slew a kid of the goats, and tainted the garment in the blood.

32. And they sent  [3garment 1the 2colored], and they carried it to their father, and said, This we found, do you recognize if the garment  [2son 1is of your] or not?

33. And he recognized it, and said, The garment  [2of my son 1is], [2wild beast 1a ferocious] devoured him, a wild beast seized  Joseph.

34. [3tore 1And 2Jacob]  his clothes, and placed sackcloth upon  his loin, and mourned for  his son [2days 1many].

35. [6came together 1And 2all  3his sons 4and  5daughters]. And they came to comfort him, and he did not want to be comforted, saying that, I will go down to  my son in mourning into Hades. And [2wept 3for him  1his father].

36. And the Midianites gave  Joseph into Egypt  to Potiphar the castrato of Pharaoh -- the chief guard.  

## Genesis 38

1.  Judah and Tamar And it came to pass in  that time, Judah went from  his brothers, and he arrived unto before a certain man of Adullam, whose name was Hirah.

2. And [2saw 3there 1Judah] a daughter of a Canaanite man, whose name was Shuah. And he took her, and entered to her.

3. And she conceived and bore a son, and she called  his name, Er.

4. And she conceived and bore a son still again, and she called  his name, Onan.

5. And adding she bore a son, and she called  his name, Shelah. And she was in Chezib when she bore them.

6. And Judah took a wife for Er  his first-born, whose name was Tamar.

7. And it came to pass Er the first-born of Judah was wicked before the lord; and [2killed 3him  1God].

8. [3said 1And 2Judah]  to Onan, Enter to the wife  of your brother, and ally to her by marriage, and raise up seed to your brother!

9. [3knowing 1And 2Onan] that [4not 6his 3will 5be 1the 2seed] -- that it came to pass whenever he entered to  [2wife  1his brother's], he discharged upon the ground,  to not give seed to his brother.

10. [3wicked 1And 2it appeared] before  God that he did this; and he put to death also this one.

11. [3said 1And 2Judah] to Tamar  his daughter-in-law, You sit as a widow in the house  of your father! until [4older 3becomes 1Shelah  2my son]. For he said, Lest at any time [3should die 2also 1this one] as also  his brothers. [3going forth 1And 2Tamar] settled in the house  of her father.

12. [4multiplied 1And 2the 3days], and [5died 1Shuah 2the 3wife 4of Judah]. And being comforted, Judah ascended to the shearing  of his sheep, himself and Hirah  his shepherd the Adullamite, unto Timnath.

13. And it was reported to Tamar  his daughter-in-law, saying, Behold,  your father-in-law ascends to Timnath, to shear  his sheep.

14. And removing the garments of the widowhood from herself, she put around a lightweight covering, and bedecked herself, and sat by the gates of Enaim, which is in the byway of Timnath. For she knew that [3older 2was 1Shelah], but he did not give her to him as wife.

15. And [2seeing 3her 1Judah], assumed her to be a harlot. For she covered up  her face, and [3not 1he recognized 2her].

16. And he turned aside to her in the way. And he said to her, Allow me to enter to you. For he did not know that [2his daughter-in-law 1she is]. And she said, What will you give to me, if you should enter to me?

17. And he said, I will send to you a kid of the goats from out of  my flocks. And she said, You should give a deposit until  you send it.

18. And he said, What  deposit shall I give to you?  And she said,  Your ring, and the pendant, and the rod  in  your hand. And he gave them to her, and he entered to her. And [2in 3the womb 1she conceived] from him.

19. And rising up she went forth. And she removed  her lightweight garment from herself, and put on the garments  of her widowhood.

20. [3sent 1And 2Judah] the kid of the goats by the hand  of his shepherd the Adullamite, to deliver by him to the woman the deposit. And he did not find her.

21. And he asked the men  of the place, Where is the harlot, the one being in Enaim upon the way? And they said, There was no [2here 1harlot].

22. And he returned to Judah, and said, I did not find her, and the men, the ones from the place, say, There was no [2here 1harlot].

23. [3said 1And 2Judah], Let her have them, but lest at any time we should be ridiculed, I indeed sent  this kid, but you have not found her.

24. And it came to pass after three months, it was announced  to Judah, saying, [3fornicated 1Tamar  2your daughter-in-law]. And behold, [2in 3the womb 1she has one] out of harlotry. [3said 1And 2Judah], Lead her out, and let her be incinerated!

25. [3her 1And 2while leading], she sent to  her father-in-law, saying, From the man whom these things are I [2in 3the womb 1have one]. And she said, Recognize whose  ring and  pendant and  rod these are!

26. [3realized 1And 2Judah], and said, Tamar has done justice rather than I, because I did not give her Shelah  my son. And he did not add any longer  to know her.

27. And it came to pass when she was bearing, that thus there were twins in  her womb.

28. And it came to pass in  her bearing, the one put forth first the hand. And taking it, the midwife tied upon  his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This one will come forth prior.

29. And as he retracted the hand,  straightway came forth  his brother.  And she said, Why was [2cut 3because of 4you 1the barrier]? And she called  his name, Pharez.

30. And after this came forth  his brother, of which was upon  his hand the scarlet thread. And she called  his name Zarah.  

## Genesis 39

1.  Joseph in Potiphar's House And Joseph was carried down into Egypt. And [2acquired 3him 1Potiphar], the eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief guard, an Egyptian man, from out of the hands of the Ishmaelites, the ones that led him there.

2. And the lord was with Joseph. And he was a man succeeding in things. And he was in the house by  his master the Egyptian.

3. [3saw 1And  2his master] that the lord was with him, and whatever as much as he should do, the lord prospered the way by  his hands.

4. And Joseph found favor before  his master. And he was well-pleasing to him, and he placed him over  his house; and all as much as was his he gave through the hand of Joseph.

5. And it came to pass after  placing him over  his house, and over all as much as was his, that the lord blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph; and he became a blessing for his master in all  his possessions in the house, and in  his fields.

6. And he committed to care all as much as was his into the hand of Joseph. And he did not know the things about his own -- not one thing, except the bread which he ate. And Joseph was good to the sight, and handsome  in appearance -- exceedingly. 

7.  Potiphar's Wife And it happened after  these things, and [4put 1the 2wife  3of his master]  her eyes upon Joseph. And she said, Come to bed with me!

8. But he was not willing. And he said to the wife  of his master, If  my master does not know on account of me one thing in  his house, and all as much as is his he gave into  my hands,

9. and not exists in  this house one thing outside of me, nor is [2secretly removed 3from 4me 1one thing], besides you, on account of  you [2his wife 1being], then how should I do  [2thing  1this wicked], and sin before  God?

10. And when she spoke to Joseph day by day, and he did not obey her to sleep with her,  to be intimate with her.

11. And it came to pass on such a day, Joseph entered into the house to do  his works, and no one was  in the house inside.

12. And she drew him by his clothes, saying, Come to bed with me! And leaving behind  his clothes in  her hands, he fled and went forth outside.

13. And it came to pass as she saw that leaving behind  his clothes in  her hands, he fled and went forth outside,

14. that she called the ones being in the house, and said to them, saying, See! he brought in to us a Hebrew servant to mock us. He entered to me, saying, Come to bed with me! And I yelled [2voice 1a great].

15. And in  his hearing that [2was raised  1my voice], and I yelled, leaving behind  his clothes by me, he fled, and he went forth outside.

16. And she left the clothes by herself, until [3came 1the 2master] into  his house.

17. And she spoke to him concerning  these things, saying, There entered to me the Hebrew servant, whom you brought in to us, to mock me. And he said to me, I will come to bed with you.

18. But as he heard that I raised  my voice, and I yelled, leaving behind  his clothes by me, he fled, and went forth outside.

19. And it happened as [2heard  1his master] the words  of his wife, as much as she spoke to him, saying, Thus [2did 3to me  1your servant], that he was enraged with anger. 

20.  Joseph Cast into Prison And [3taking 1the 2master] Joseph, put him into the fortress, in the place in which the prisoners of the king were held there in the fortress.

21. And the lord was with Joseph, and he poured down upon him mercy; and he gave to him favor before the chief jailer.

22. And [3gave 1the 2chief jailer] the jail over to the hand of Joseph, and all the ones being taken away, as many as were in the jail, and all as much as they do there, he was doing.

23. For not was the chief jailer of the jail knowing anything concerning him -- not one thing. For all was through the hand of Joseph, because of the reason the lord [2with 3him 1being]. And as much as he did, the lord prospered the way in  his hands.  

## Genesis 40

1.  Joseph Interprets Dreams And it came to pass after  these things, [6sinned 1the 2chief wine taster 3of the 4king 5of Egypt], and the chief baker against their master the king of Egypt.

2. And Pharaoh was provoked to anger over  [2two 3eunuchs 1his] -- over the chief wine taster and over the chief baker.

3. And he put them under guard in the jail, into the place where Joseph had been taken away there.

4. And [3combined 1the 2chief jailer]  them to Joseph, and he stood beside them. And they were some days under  guard.

5. And [2saw 1both] a dream in one night. And the vision of the dream of the chief wine taster and the chief baker, the ones who were in service to the king of Egypt, the ones being in the jail, was this.

6. [3entered 1And 4to 5them 2Joseph] in the morning, and he saw them, and they were disturbed.

7. And he asked the eunuchs of Pharaoh, who were with him under  guard, by  his master, saying, Why is it that  your faces are looking downcast today?

8.  And they said to him, [2a dream 1We saw], and the interpreting it is not. [3said 1And 4to them 2Joseph], [2not 6through  7God 3the 4explanation 5of them 1Is]? Describe them then to me.

9. And [3described 1the 2chief wine taster]  his dream to Joseph. And he said, In  my sleep there was a grapevine before me.

10. And in the grapevine three lower branches; and it flourished offering [2buds 1mature] -- the clusters of the grape.

11. And the cup of Pharaoh was in  my hand, and I took the grape cluster and squeezed it into the cup, and gave the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.

12. And [2said 3to him 1Joseph], This is the interpretation of it. The three lower branches [2three 3days 1are].

13. In yet three days and Pharaoh will remember  your office, and restore you to  your office of chief wine taster, and you will give the cup to Pharaoh, into  his hand according to  [3office 1your  2former], as you were of the wine servers.

14. But remember me of yourself, whenever good happens to you, and you shall do with me an act of mercy. And you shall remind [2concerning 3me  1Pharaoh], and lead me from  this fortress.

15. For by stealth I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here I did not do anything, but they put me into  this pit.

16. And [3saw 1the 2chief baker] that rightly he interpreted, and he said  to Joseph, I also saw a dream, and I imagined three bins of groats, lifted upon  my head.

17. And in the bin  above, items of all  kinds of things of which Pharaoh eats -- the work of a baker. And the birds of the heaven ate them from the bin  upon  my head.

18. And answering Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it. The three bins [2three 3days 1are].

19. Yet in three days and Pharaoh will remove  your head from you, and hang you upon a timber, and [5will eat 1the 2birds 3of the 4heaven] the flesh from you.

20. And it came to pass in the [2day  1third], [3day 2the birth 1that it was] of Pharaoh, and he made a banquet for all  his servants, and he remembered concerning the chief wine taster, and the office of the chief baker in the midst  of his servants.

21. And he restored the chief wine taster to  his office, and he gave the cup unto the hand of Pharaoh.

22. And the chief baker he hung, as [2interpreted 3to them 1Joseph].

23. And [3remembered not 1the 2chief wine taster]  Joseph, but forgot him.  

## Genesis 41

1.  Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams And it came to pass after two years of days, Pharaoh saw a dream. He imagined standing at the river.

2. And behold, as if from the river ascended seven oxen good to the sight and choice in the flesh; and they were grazing in the reed-grass.

3. And another seven oxen ascended after these from out of the river, shameful to the sight and thin in the flesh, and feeding by the oxen by the edge of the river.

4. And [9ate up 1the 2seven 8oxen  3shameful 4and 5thin 6in the 7flesh] the seven oxen  good to the sight and  choice. [3arose 1And 2Pharaoh].

5. And he dreamed the second time. And behold, seven [4ears of corn 5ascended 6in 7the 9lower branch 8one 1choice 2and 3good].

6. And behold, seven ears of corn, thin and destroyed by the wind grew up after them.

7. And [7swallowed down 1the 2seven 6ears of corn  3thin 4and 5destroyed by wind] the seven [4ears of corn  1choice 2and  3full]. [3arose 1And 2Pharaoh], and it was a dream.

8. And it came to pass in the morning and [2was disturbed  1his soul]. And sending, he called all the expositors of Egypt, and all  her wise men. And [2described 3to them 1Pharaoh]  his dream. And there was no one  reporting it  to Pharaoh.

9. And [3spoke 1the 2chief wine taster] to Pharaoh, saying,  My sin I call to mind today.

10. Pharaoh was provoked to anger against his servants, and he put us under guard in the house of the chief guard -- both me and the chief baker.

11. And we saw a dream, both in [2night 1one], I and he, each according to  his dream saw.

12. And there was there with us a young Hebrew servant of the chief guard. And we described to him, and he interpreted to us.

13. And it came to pass as he interpreted to us, so also it came to pass, both me being restored to  my office, and that one being hanged.

14. [3having sent 1And 2Pharaoh], called  for Joseph. And they led him from the fortress, and shaved him, and changed  his apparel, and he came to Pharaoh.

15. [3said 1And 2Pharaoh] to Joseph, [2a dream 1I have seen], and  [2not one interpreting 1there is] it. But I have heard concerning you, saying, In your hearing dreams you interpret them.

16. [3answering 1And 2Joseph]  to Pharaoh said, Without  God [2shall not be answered  1deliverance] to Pharaoh.

17. [3spoke 1And 2Pharaoh]  to Joseph, saying, In  my sleep I imagined standing by the edge of the river.

18. And as if from out of the river ascended seven oxen, good to the sight and choice in the flesh, and they fed at the reed-grass.

19. And behold, [2seven 3oxen 1another] ascended after them from the river, in a sorry state and shameful to the sight, and thin in the flesh, what thing [2I saw not 1such as] [2in 3the entire 4land 5of Egypt 1a shameful thing].

20. And [7ate up 1the 2seven 6oxen  3shameful 4and 5thin] the seven oxen -- the first, the good and the choice.

21. And they entered into  their bellies. And it did not [2apparent 1become] that they entered into  their bellies. And  their appearance was shameful, as also in the beginning. And after awakening, I went back to bed.

22. And I saw again in  my sleep, even as if seven ears of corn ascended in [2lower branch 1one], full and good.

23. And another seven ears of corn, thin and destroyed by the wind grew up next to them.

24. And [7swallowed down 1the 2seven 6ears of corn  3thin 4and 5destroyed by the wind] the seven [4ears of corn  1good 2and  3full]. I told it then to the expositors, and there was no one  reporting it to me.

25. And Joseph said  to Pharaoh, The dream to Pharaoh is one. As much as  God does, he showed to Pharaoh.

26. The seven [2oxen  1good 4seven 5years 3are], and the seven [2ears of corn  1good 4seven 5years 3are]; the dream of Pharaoh is one.

27. And the seven [2oxen  1thin], the ones ascending after them, [2seven 3years 1are]; and the seven [4ears of corn  1thin 2and 3destroyed by the wind 6seven 7years 5are] -- there will be seven years of famine.

28. And the saying which I have said to Pharaoh, [3as much  1God 2will do] to show to Pharaoh.

29. Behold, for seven years there comes [2prosperity 1great] in all the land of Egypt.

30. [5shall come 1But 2seven 3years 4of famine] after these, and they shall forget the fullness  being in all the land Egypt, and [3will consume 1the 2famine] the land.

31. And [3shall not 4be realized 1the 2prosperity] in the land because of the famine  being after these things. [4strong 1For 2it will be 3exceedingly].

32. And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it is because [5will be true 1the 2saying  3by  4God], and God will hasten  to do it.

33. Now then, look about for a man intelligent and discerning, and place him over the land of Egypt!

34. And let Pharaoh make and place toparchs over the land. And let them take a fifth of all the produce of the land of Egypt of the seven years  of prosperity!

35. And let them bring together all the foods  [3seven 5years  2coming  4good 1of these]! And let them bring together the grain under the hand of Pharaoh! foods [2in 3the 4cities 1to be guarded].

36. And [4shall be 1the 2foods  3being guarded] for the land in the seven years of the famine, which will be in the land of Egypt, and [3shall not be obliterated 1the 2land] in the famine.

37. [4was pleasing 1And 2the 3saying] before Pharaoh, and before all  his servants. 

38.  Joseph Made Ruler Over Egypt And Pharaoh said to his servants, Shall we find [2a man 1such] who has spirit of God in him?

39. [3said 1And 2Pharaoh]  to Joseph, Since God showed to you all these things, there is not a man more intelligent and more discerning than you.

40. You will be over  my house, and by  your mouth [3shall obey 1all  2my people]. Except for the throne -- [2will excel 3you 1I].

41. [3said 1And 2Pharaoh]  to Joseph, Behold, I place you today over all the land of Egypt.

42. And Pharaoh removing the ring from  his hand, put it upon the hand of Joseph. And he put on him [2apparel 1fine linen], and he put a collar of gold about  his neck.

43. And he transported him upon  [3chariot  2second  1his]. And [2proclaimed 3in front of 4him 1a herald]. And he placed him over the entire land of Egypt.

44. [3said 1And 2Pharaoh]  to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, without you not [2shall lift 1anyone]  his hand over all the land of Egypt.

45. And Pharaoh called the name of Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah. And he gave to him  Asenath, daughter of Poti-phera, priest of Heliopolis, to him as a wife.

46. And Joseph was [2years old 1thirty] when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. [3went forth 1And 2Joseph] from the face of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.

47. And [3produced 1the 2land] in the seven years  prosperity of sheaves.

48. And was brought together all the foods of the seven years in which there was  prosperity in the land of Egypt. And he put the foods in the cities. Foods of the plains of the city of the places round about it, he put in it.

49. And Joseph gathered together grain as the sand of the sea, much exceedingly, until they were not able to count it, [3no 1for 2there was] number.

50.  And to Joseph were born [2sons 1two] before the coming of the seven years  of famine, which [2bore 3to him 1Asenath], the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of Heliopolis.

51. [3called 1And 2Joseph] the name of the first-born, Manasseh, for [3me forget 2made  1God] all  my miseries, and all of the things  of my father.

52. And the name of the second he called, Ephraim, for [2increased 3me  1God] in the land of my humiliation.

53. And went by the seven years  of prosperity, which came to pass in the land of Egypt.

54. And [5began 1the 2seven 3years  4of famine] to come as Joseph said. And there became famine in all the earth; but in all the land of Egypt there were bread loaves.

55. And [5hungered 1all 2the 3land 4of Egypt]. [4cried out 1And 2the 3people] to Pharaoh for bread loaves. [3said 1And 2Pharaoh] to all the Egyptians, You go to Joseph, and what ever he says to you, you do!

56. And the famine was upon the face of all the earth. [3opened 1And 2Joseph] all the granaries, and sold to all the Egyptians.

57. And all the regions came to Egypt to buy from Joseph, [4prevailed 1for 2the 3famine] in all the earth.  

## Genesis 42

1.  Joseph's Brothers Seek Food in Egypt [3seeing 1And 2Jacob] that there is grain for sale in Egypt, said to  his sons, Why are you lazy?

2. Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy for us a small amount of foods! that we should live, and not die.

3. [5went down 1And 2the 3brothers 4of Joseph], the ten, to buy grain from Egypt.

4.  But Benjamin the brother of Joseph was not sent with  his brothers. For he said, Lest at any time should come to pass to him an infirmity.

5. [5came 1And 2the 3sons 4of Israel] to buy with the ones coming; [4was 1for 2the 3famine] in the land of Canaan.

6. And Joseph was the ruler of the land; he sold to all the people of the land. [5coming 1And 2the 3brothers 4of Joseph] did obeisance to him upon their face upon the ground.

7. [3seeing 1And 2Joseph]  his brothers recognized and alienated himself from them, and he spoke to them hard. And he said to them, From what place have you come? And they said, From out of the land of Canaan, to buy foods.

8. [3recognized 1And 2Joseph]  his brothers, but they did not recognize him.

9. And Joseph remembered  his dreams, of which he himself saw. And he said to them, You are spies to study the tracks of the place in which you have come.

10.  And they said, Not so, O lord,  your servants came to buy foods.

11. We are all sons of one man; we are peaceable. [2are not  1Your servants] spies.

12. And he said to them, No, but [3the 4tracks 5of the 6land 1you came 2to see].

13.  And they said, [3twelve 1We are  2your servants] brothers in the land of Canaan; and behold,  our younger brother is with  our father today, and the other does not exist.

14. [3said 1And 4to them 2Joseph], This is it that I have said to you, saying that, You are spies.

15. In this you shall appear exposed, by the health of Pharaoh, no way should you go forth from here, if [4should not  3brother 1your  2younger] come here.

16. You send [2from 3you 1one], and take  your brother! But you shall be taken away until  [3apparent 2become  1your sayings], if you be truthful, or not. But if not, by the health of Pharaoh, assuredly you are spies.

17. And he put them in prison [2days 1three].

18. And he said to them  [3day 1on the 2third], You do this and you shall live!  [4God 1For 2I 3fear].

19. If you are peaceable, [3of your brothers 1let 4be held 2one] in the prison! but you yourselves proceed, and take back the purchase  of your provision!

20. And  [4brother 2your  3younger 1you lead] to me! and I will trust  your sayings; but if not you shall die. And they did so.

21. And said each to  his brother, Yes, [3in 4sins 1for 2we are] on account of  our brother, for we overlooked the affliction  of his soul when he besought us, and we did not listen to him, and because of this [2came 3upon 4us  1this affliction].

22. [3answering 1And 2Reuben] said to them, Did I not speak to you, saying, You should not wrong the lad, and you did not hearken to me? And behold,  his blood is required.

23. And they did not know that Joseph heard, for the translator [2between 3them 1was].

24. And turning from them, Joseph wept. And again he came forward to them, and spoke to them. And he took  Simeon from them, and he tied him before them.

25. [3gave charge 1And 2Joseph] to fill up  their containers of grain, and to give back  their silver to each in  his sackcloth, and to give them provisions for the journey. And it became to them so.

26. And placing the grain upon  their donkeys, they went forth from there.

27. [3untying 1And 2one]  his bag, to give fodder to his donkeys where they rested, and he saw  [2bundle  3of silver 1his], for it was upon the mouth of the bag.

28. And he said  to his brothers, [3was given back 4to me 1the 2silver], and behold, this is in  my bag. And it startled  their hearts, and they were disturbed with one another, saying, What is this God did to us? 

29.  Joseph's Brothers Return to Canaan And they came to Jacob  their father in the land of Canaan. And they reported to him all the things coming to pass to them, saying,

30. [7spoke 1The 2man 3the 4master 5of the 6land] to us hard, and put us in prison as spying out the land.

31. And we said to him, We are peaceable, we are not spies.

32. Twelve brothers we are, sons  of our father; the one does not exist, and the younger is with  our father today in the land of Canaan.

33. [8said 1And 9to us 2the 3man 4the 5master 6of the 7land], By this I will know that you are peaceable, [3of your brothers 1you leave 2one] here with me! and the purchase of the provision  for your house having taken, you go forth!

34. And you lead to me  [3brother 1your  2younger]! and I shall know that [2not 3spies 1you are], but that you are peaceable, and  [3your brother 1I will give back 2to you], and [2in the 3land 1you can trade]!

35. And it happened in  their emptying  their sackcloths, and there was [3in each  1a bundle  2of silver] in  their sackcloth. And they saw the bundles  of their silver to them, and  their father, and they feared.

36. [4said 1And 5to them 2Jacob  3their father], You are making me childless; Joseph is not, Simeon is not, and  will you take Benjamin? Upon me [3happened 2these things 1all].

37. [3said 1And 2Reuben] to his father, saying, The two sons of mine you may kill if I do not lead him to you. You give him into  my hand, and I will lead him to you.

38.  And he said, [2shall not 3go down  1My son] with you, for  his brother died, and he alone is left behind. And suppose it shall come to pass that he be infirm in the way which ever you go, and you will lead me  in old age with distress into Hades.  

## Genesis 43

1.  Joseph's Brothers Return to Egypt But the famine grew in strength upon the land.

2. And it came to pass when they completed eating up the grain which they brought from Egypt, that [2said 3to them  1their father], In again going, you buy us a small amount of foods!

3. [3said 1And 4to him 2Judah], saying, [3bore witness 4by testifying 5to us 1The 2man], the master of the land, saying, You shall not see  my face if [4should not  3brother 1your  2younger 6with 7you 5come].

4. If  then, you send  our brother with us, we will go down, and we will buy foods for you.

5. But if you do not send  our brother with us, we will not go, for the man said to us, saying, You shall not see my  face if [4should not  3brother 1your  2younger 6with 7you 5be].

6. [3said 1And 2Israel], Why did you do evil to me announcing to the man that there is to you a brother?

7.  And they said, In asking, [3asked 4of us 1the 2man] and  our family, saying, Does [2still  1our father] live, and if there is to us a brother. And we reported to him according to  this questioning. We did not know that he would say to us, You bring  your brother!

8. [3said 1And 2Judah] to Israel  his father, You send the lad with me, and rising up let us go, that we may live and not die, and we and you and  our belongings.

9. I will look out for him. [3from out of 4my hand 1You seek 2him]. If I do not lead him to you, and set him before you, I will be sinning against you all the days.

10. [2if 4not 1For 3we slowed], already even we should have returned twice.

11. [4said 1And 5to them 2Israel  3their father], If so it is, this you do! You take from the fruits of the earth in  your containers, and bring to the man gifts  of balm, and  of honey, and incense, and balsam, and turpentine, and walnuts!

12. And  [3silver 2double 1you take] in  your hands. And the silver  being returned in  your bags, return it with you, perhaps it is by ignorance!

13. And  [2your brother 1you take], and rising go down to the man!

14.  And my God give to you favor before the man, even to send  your brother, the other one, and  Benjamin. [3I indeed 1For 2as much as] have been made childless, I have been made childless.

15. [4receiving 1And 2the 3men]  these gifts, and the [2silver 1double] they took in  their hands, and  Benjamin, and rising up they went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

16. [3saw 1And 2Joseph] them, and  Benjamin  his brother, the one born of the same mother. And he said to the one over  his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay the things offered for sacrifices, and prepare! [5with 6me 1for 4will eat 2the 3men] bread loaves  at midday.

17. [4did 1And 2the 3man] as Joseph said. And he brought the men into the house of Joseph.

18. [4seeing 1And 2the 3men] that they were brought into the house of Joseph, said, On account of the silver  returned in  our bags in the beginning we are brought in --  to extort us, and to place charge upon us,  to take us as servants, and  our donkeys.

19. And coming forward to the man, the one over the house  of Joseph, they spoke to him in the vestibule of the house,

20. saying, We beseech you, O master, we went down in the beginning to buy foods,

21. and it happened when we came to  rest up, and we opened  our bags, that thus, the silver was in each  of his bag.  [3our silver 4with 5the weight 1We returned 2now] in  our hands,

22. and [3silver 2other 1we brought] with ourselves to buy foods, we do not know who put the silver in  our bags.

23. And he said to them, Kindness be to you, do not fear.  Your God, and the God  of your fathers gave to you treasures in  your bags, and  your silver in approving I receive. And he led out to them  Simeon.

24. And he brought water to wash  their feet. And he gave fodder to their donkeys.

25. And they prepared the gifts until  [2came 3at 1Joseph] midday. For they heard that [3there 1he was about 2to dine].

26. [3entered 1And 2Joseph] into the house, and they brought to him the gifts which they had in  their hands, into the house. And they did obeisance to him upon their face upon the ground.

27. And he asked them, How have you been? And he said to them, Is [2in health  1your father], the old man whom you spoke of? Still he lives?

28.  And they said, He is in health --  your servant  our father, still lives. And he said, Blessed be  that man  by God. And bowing they did obeisance to him.

29. And looking up with  his eyes, he saw Benjamin  his brother, the one born of the same mother. And he said, This is  your brother the younger whom you spoke to me of bringing? And he said,  God show mercy to you child.

30. [3was disturbed 1And 2Joseph]. [3contracted 1For  2his innards] over  his brother, and he was seeking to weep, and he entered into the storeroom to weep there.

31. And he washed  his face, and coming forth he controlled himself, and said, You place the bread loaves.

32. And they placed a setting to him alone, and to them by themselves, and to the Egyptians  dining with them by themselves, [4were not 1for 5able 2the 3Egyptians] to eat [2with 3the 4Hebrews 1bread loaves], [3an abomination 1for 2it is] to the Egyptians.

33. And he seated before himself the first-born according to  their seniority, and the younger according to his youth. [5were looking amazed 1And 2the 3men 4each] at  his brother.

34. And they lifted away the portions from him to them. [5was magnified 1And 2the 3portion 4of Benjamin] over the portions of all -- five-fold over  those. And they drank and became intoxicated with him.  

## Genesis 44

1.  Joseph's Cup And Joseph gave charge to the one over  his house, saying, Fill the bags of the men with foods, as much as they are able to lift away. And put in each the silver at the mouth of the bag.

2. And  [3drinking cup 1my  2silver] put into the bag of the younger, and the value  of his grain. And it happened according to the word of Joseph, as he said.

3. In the morning light shone through, and the men were sent, they and  their donkeys.

4. [3going forth from 1And 2their] the city, not [2distance 1at a far], and Joseph said to the one over  his house, In rising up, pursue after the men, and you shall overtake them! And you shall say to them, For what reason did you recompense bad for good? Why did you steal my  [2drinking cup  1silver]?

5. [2not 1Is this] in which [2drinks  1my master]? And he [2an omen 1foretells] by it? [2the wicked things 1You completed] which you have done.

6. And having found them, he said to them according to  these words.

7.  And they said to him, Why speaks the master in  these words? May it not be  for your servants to do according to  this word;

8. since the  silver which we found in  our bags we returned to you from the land of Canaan. How then would we steal from out of the house  of your master silver or gold?

9. By whom ever [3should be found 1the 2drinking cup]  of your servants, let him die. [3also 2we 1And] will be servants to your master!

10.  And he said, And now as you say, so it will be. By whom ever [3should be found 1the 2drinking cup], will be my servant, and you all shall be pure.

11. And they hastened, and [2lowered 1each]  his bag upon the ground, and [2opened 1each]  his bag.

12. And he searched [2from 3the 4older 1beginning] until he came to the younger. And he found the drinking cup in the bag  of Benjamin.

13. And they tore  their cloaks, and [2placed 1each]  his bag upon  his donkey, and returned to the city.

14. [3entered 1And 2Judah] and  his brothers to Joseph, while he was there. And they fell before him upon the ground.

15. [3said 1And 4to them 2Joseph], What is  this you did? Did you not know that [5an omen 4shall foretell  1a man 2such as 3I]?

16. [3said 1And 2Judah], How shall we contradict the master, or what shall we speak, or how shall we be justified?  For God found the injustice  of your servants. Behold, we are servants to our master, both we and by whom was found with the drinking cup.

17. [3said 1And 2Joseph], Let it not be to me to do  this thing. The man by whom was found with the drinking cup, he will be my servant. But you all ascend with safety to  your father.

18. And approaching to him, Judah said, I beseech O lord, let [2speak  1your servant] before you, and be not enraged with your servant, for you are after Pharaoh!

19. O lord you asked  your servants, saying, [2you 1Have] a father or brother?

20. And we said to the master, There is to us a father, an older man, and [2child 4old age 1a younger 3in his], and  his brother died, and he alone was left behind  of his mother,  and his father loved him.

21. And you said to your servants, Lead him to me! and I will care for him.

22. And we said to the master, [3is not able 1The 2child] to leave  his father; and if he should leave  his father, he will die.

23. And you said to your servants, If [4does not 5go down  3brother 1Your  2younger] with you, you shall not proceed to see  my face.

24. And it happened when we ascended to  your servant our father, we reported to him the words  of our master.

25. [3said 1And  2our father], Proceed again, and buy for us a small amount of foods!

26. And we said, We will not be able to go down; but if then  [3brother 1our  2younger] goes down with us, we will go down; for not will we be able to see the face of the man,  [4brother 2our  3younger 1if] is not being with us.

27. [4said 1And  2our father  3your servant] to us, You know that [4two 2bore 3to me  1my wife];

28. and [3went forth 1the 2one] from me, and you said that, [2devoured by wild beasts 1He was]. And I did not see him as far as now.

29. If then you should take also this one from  my face, and comes to pass to him an infirmity in the way, then know that you will lead me  in old age with distress into Hades.

30. Now then, if I should enter to  your servant [3father 1and 2our], and the child should not be with us, then know his life depends on  this one's life.

31. And it will be in  his seeing [3not 4being 1the 2child] with us, he will come to an end, and [2will lead  1your servants]  to old age  your servant [3father 1and 2our] with distress into Hades.

32.  For your servant has looked out for the child for  my father, saying, If I do not lead him to you, [2sinning 1I will be] against my father all the days.

33. Now then, I will remain to you as a servant instead of the child, as a domestic servant  of my master. But let the child ascend with  his brothers.

34. For how shall I ascend to the father of the child not being with us, that I should not see the bad things which will find  my father?  

## Genesis 45

1.  Joseph Reveals Himself to His Brothers And [2was not 3able 1Joseph] to withhold of all the ones standing beside him. But he said, Send all from me! And  [2stood beside 1no one]  Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.

2. And he let go with a voice of weeping. [5heard 1And 2all 3the 4Egyptians], and [2audible 1it became] into the house of Pharaoh.

3. [3said 1And 2Joseph] to  his brothers, I am Joseph, [3still  2father 1does my] live? And [3were not 4able 1the 2brothers] to respond to him, for they were disturbed.

4. [3said 1And 2Joseph] to  his brothers, Approach to me! And they approached. And he said, I am Joseph  your brother, whom you delivered into Egypt.

5. Now then do not fret, nor [2hard 3to you 1let it appear] that you delivered me here; [5for 1for 6life 3sent 4me  2God] in front of you.

6. For this second year a famine is upon the earth, and still remaining are five years in which there is no plowing nor harvest.

7. [3sent 1For 4me  2God] in front of you, that there may be left to you a vestige upon the earth, and to nourish to you [2remnant 1a great].

8. Now then, you did not send me here, but  God. And he made me as father to Pharaoh, and master of all  his house, and ruler of all the land of Egypt.

9. Hastening then, you ascend to  my father and say to him! Thus says  your son Joseph. [2made 3me  1God] master of all the land of Egypt. Come down then to me! and you should not wait.

10. And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me, you and  your sons, and the sons  of your sons,  your sheep and  your oxen, and as much as is yours.

11. And I will nourish you there. For there is still five years of famine; that you shall not be obliterated -- you and  your sons, and all  your possessions.

12. Behold,  your eyes see, and the eyes [2Benjamin  1of my brother] that  my mouth  is speaking to you.

13. Report then to my father all  my glory  in Egypt, and as much as you saw! And hastening, bring down  my father here!

14. And falling upon the neck of Benjamin  his brother, he weeped upon him. And Benjamin weeped upon  his neck.

15. And kissing all  his brothers, he wept on them. And after these things [2spoke  1his brothers] to him.

16. And [3was proclaimed forth 1the 2report] into the house of Pharaoh, saying, [4have come 1The 2brothers 3of Joseph]. [3rejoiced 1And 2Pharaoh], and  his attendant.

17. [3said 1And 2Pharaoh] to Joseph, Speak to your brothers! This you do, fill  your carriages and go forth into the land of Canaan!

18. And taking up  your father, and  your possessions, come to me! And I will give to you all the good things of Egypt, and you shall eat the marrow of the land.

19.  And you charge these to take for themselves wagons from out of the land of Egypt  for your children, and  your wives! And taking up  your father come!

20. And you should not be sparing to the eyes  of your items, [3the 1for 2all] good things of Egypt will be unto you.

21. And they did thus, the sons of Israel. [3gave 1And 2Joseph] to them wagons, according to the sayings by Pharaoh the king. And he gave to them provisions for the journey.

22. And to all he gave double robes. But to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of gold, and five changings of robes.

23. And to his father he sent according to the same, and ten donkeys carrying of all the good things of Egypt; and ten mules carrying bread loaves to his father for the journey.

24. [3sent out 1And 2Joseph]  his brothers. And they went. And he said to them, Do not be provoked to anger in the way!

25. And they ascended from out of Egypt. And they came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob  their father.

26. And they announced to him, saying that,  Your son Joseph lives, and he rules all the land of Egypt. And [2receded  3in his thought 1Jacob], for he did not trust them.

27. And they spoke to him all the sayings of Joseph, as much as he said to them. And seeing the wagons which Joseph sent, so as to take him, [5rekindled 1the 2spirit 3of Jacob  4their father].

28. [3said 1And 2Israel], [2a great thing 3to me 1It is] if [3still 1Joseph  2my son] lives. In going I will see him before  dying.   

## Genesis 46

1.  Jacob and His Family Move to Egypt [3departing 1And 2Israel], and all  of his, he came upon the Well of the Oath. And he sacrificed a sacrifice to the God  of his father Isaac.

2. [3said 1And  2God]  to Israel in a vision in the night, saying, Jacob, Jacob!  And he said, What is it?

3. And he says to him, I am the God  of your fathers; do not fear to go down into Egypt! [4into 1For 6nation 5a great 2I will make 3you] there.

4. And I will go down with you into Egypt. And I will transport you to the end. And Joseph will put  his hands upon  your eyes.

30. And Israel said to Joseph, I will gladly die from  now on, since I have seen  your face, for still you live.

9. And Jacob said  to Pharaoh, The days of the years  of my life which I sojourned are a hundred thirty years; small and severe have become the days of the years  of my life; they did not attain to the days of the years of the life  of my fathers, which days they sojourned.

10. And Jacob having blessed  Pharaoh, he went forth from him.

17. And they led  their cattle to Joseph. And [2gave 3to them 1Joseph] bread loaves in return for the horses, and for the sheep, and for the oxen, and for the donkeys. And he nourished them with bread loaves in exchange for all  of their cattle in  that year.

18. [4went by 1And  3year 2that], and they came to him in the [2year  1second], and said to him, Lest at some time we should be obliterated from  our master -- for since [3has dissipated 1the 2silver], and the possessions, and the cattle to you, the master, and there has not been left behind to us before  our master, but only  our own body and  our land,

19. that then we might not die before you, and the land should be made desolate, you acquire us and  our land for bread loaves, and we will be to you and  our land, servants  to Pharaoh! Give us seed! that we should sow, and we should live and should not die, and the land will not be made desolate.

21. And the people were reduced to slavery to him as servants from the uttermost parts of the boundaries of Egypt, unto the uttermost parts,

22. except the land of the priests only [2did not 3acquire 4this 1Joseph], [4a 5portion 1for 3gave 6as a gift 7to the 8priests 2Pharaoh]. And they ate the portion which [2gave 3to them 1Pharaoh]. On account of this they did not give up  their land.

23. [3said 1And 2Joseph] to all the Egyptians, Behold, I have acquired you and  your land today  for Pharaoh. Take to yourselves seed, and sow the land!

24. And there will be  produce of it, and you will give the fifth part  to Pharaoh, and the four parts will be for you yourselves, for seed in the earth, and for food to you, and to all the ones in  your houses.

25. And they said, You have delivered us; we found favor before  our master, and we will be servants to Pharaoh.

26. And [2established it 3to them 1Joseph] as an order until  this day for the land of Egypt,  for Pharaoh to take a fifth, except of the land of the priests only, which was not to Pharaoh.

30. But I shall be gone to sleep with  my fathers, then you shall lift me from out of Egypt, and entomb me in  their burying-place.  And he said, I will do according to  your saying.

31. And he said to him, Swear by an oath to me! And he swore by an oath to him. And Israel did obeisance upon the top  of his cane.  

## Genesis 48

1.  Jacob Blesses Joseph's Sons And it came to pass after  these things, and it was announced  to Joseph that,  Your father is troubled. And taking up  [2two 3sons 1his],  Manasseh and  Ephraim, he came to Jacob.

2. And it was reported  to Jacob, saying, Behold,  your son Joseph comes to you. And Israel growing strong sat upon the bed.

3. And Jacob said  to Joseph,  My God was appeared to me in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me.

4. And he said to me, Behold, I will increase you, and I will multiply you, and I will make you into a gathering of nations. And I will give to you  this land, and to your seed after you, for [2possession 1an eternal].

5. Now then,  [2two 3sons 1your], the ones born to you in the land of Egypt, before  my coming to you in Egypt, are mine, Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mine.

6. And the progeny, who ever should be procreated after these will be yours. By the name  of their brothers they shall be called in  those lots.

7. But I, when I came from Mesopotamia  of Syria, [3died 1Rachel  2your mother] in the land of Canaan at my approaching down by the course of the horses of Habratha of the land, before  coming into Ephrath. And I buried her in the way of the course of the horses -- this is Beth-lehem.

8. [3seeing 1And 2Israel] the sons of Joseph, said, Who are these to you?

9. [3said 1And 2Joseph] to his father, [2my sons 1They are] whom [2gave 3to me  1God] here. And Jacob said, Lead [2forward 3to me 1them] that I may bless them.

10. And the eyes of Israel were weighed down because of  old age, and he was not able to see. And they approached to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.

11. And Israel said to Joseph, Behold,  [2of your face 1I was not deprived]; and behold, [2showed 3to me  1God]   your seed.

12. And [2led 3them 1Joseph] from  his knees, and they did obeisance to him with their face upon the ground.

13. [3taking 1And 2Joseph  5two 6sons 4his],  with Ephraim at the right, [2from 3the left 1but] of Israel,  and Manasseh at the left, [2from 3the right 1but] of Israel, and he approached them to him.

14. [3stretching out 1And 2Israel] the [2hand  1right] put it upon the head of Ephraim, and this one was the younger; and the left upon the head of Manasseh; crosswise with the hands.

15. And he blessed them, and he said, The God in whom [2were well-pleasing  1my fathers] in his presence -- Abraham and Isaac; the God  maintaining me from my youth until  this day;

16. the angel  rescuing me from all  evils, bless  these boys! And [2shall be called upon 3them  1my name], and the name  of my fathers -- Abraham and Isaac. And may they multiply into [2multitude 1a great] upon the earth.

17. [3seeing 1And 2Joseph] that [2put  1his father]  [2hand  1his right] upon the head of Ephraim, [2wrong 3to him 1it appeared]. And Joseph took hold of the hand  of his father to remove it from the head of Ephraim, to the head of Manasseh.

18. [3said 1And 2Joseph] to his father, Not so father, for this one is the first-born; place  your right hand upon  his head.

19. And he would not, but said, I know child, I know; and this one will be for a people, and this one will be raised up high. But  [3brother 1his  2younger 5greater 6than he 4will be], and  his seed will be a multitude of nations.

20. And he blessed them in  that day, saying, By you Israel shall be blessed, saying, [2make 3you  1God] as Ephraim and as Manasseh! And he put  Ephraim in front of  Manasseh.

21. [3said 1And 2Israel]  to Joseph, Behold, I die, and God will be with you, and he will return you to the land  of your fathers.

22. And I give to you [2portion 1a chosen out] above  your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow.  

## Genesis 49

1.  Jacob Blesses the Remaining Sons [3called 1And 2Jacob]  his sons, and said, Come together that I may announce to you what will meet to you upon the last of the days!

2. Gather and hear, O sons of Jacob, hear Israel  your father!

3. Reuben my first-born, you are my strength and the beginning of my children, stubborn to bear, and stubborn self-willed.

4. Overflowing as water, you should not erupt. For you ascended upon the marriage-bed  of your father. Then you defiled the strewn bed of which you ascended.

5. Simeon and Levi -- brothers. They completed injustice by their sects.

6. [5into 6their counsel 1May 3not 4come 2my soul], and [5with  6their joint-conspiracy 1may 3not 4be established  2my insides]. For in  their rage they killed men, and in  their passion they hamstrung a bull.

7. Accursed is  their rage, for it was self-willed. And accursed is their vehement anger, for it was hardened. I will divide them in Jacob, and disseminate them in Israel.

8. Judah, may [3have praised you  2your brothers].  Your hands are upon the back  of your enemies. [4will do obeisance to 5you 1The 2sons  3of your father];

9. [3cub 2a lion 1Judah is]. From a bud, O son of mine, you ascended. Reclining, you went to bed as a lion; and as a cub who will rouse him?

10. [2shall not fail 1A ruler] from Judah, and one leading from  his thighs, until whenever should come the things reserved to him. And he is expectation of nations.

11. Binding [2to 3a grapevine  1his foal], and with the fetter the foal  of his donkey. He shall wash [2in 3wine  1his apparel], and in the blood of the grape  his wrap-around garment.

12. [2causing joy  1His eyes] away from wine, and the white  of his teeth than milk.

13. Zebulun [2on the coast 1shall dwell], even himself by the mooring of boats; and he shall extend until Sidon.

14. Issachar [2the 3good 1desired], taking rest between the lots.

15. And seeing the rest, that it was good, and the earth, that it was plentiful, he placed  his shoulder to the toil, and became a man for farming.

16. Dan will judge  his people, as even one tribe in Israel.

17. And let Dan become a serpent upon the way, lying in wait upon the road, biting the heel of the horse. And [3shall fall 1the 2horseman] upon the rear places,

18. [2for the 3deliverance 1remaining about] of the lord.

19. Gad, a marauder will maraud against him. But he will maraud against him by feet.

20. Asher, plentiful is his  bread, and he will give a delicacy to rulers.

21. Naphtali, a trunk springing up giving [2in 3the 4offspring 1beauty].

22. [2a son 3increasing 1Joseph is]; [2son 3increasing 1zealous]; [3son 1my 2younger]; to me you returned!

23. against whom with deliberation reviled. And [3pressed against 4him 1the masters 2of the bowmen],

24. and [2were broken 3with 4might  1their bows], and [5were loosened 1the 2nerves 4arms 3of their hand's] through the hand of the mighty one of Jacob; from there the one strengthening Israel by means of God  of your father.

25. And [2gave help 3to you  1my God], and blessed you with the blessing of heaven above, and the blessing of earth having all things; because of the blessing of breasts and of the womb;

26. a blessing of your father and of your mother -- he excelled in strength over the blessing [2mountains 1of the stable], and beyond the blessings [2hills 1of everlasting]; they will be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top [2whom 3he took the lead 1of the brothers].

27. Benjamin, [2wolf 1a predacious 4in the 5early morning 3shall eat], yet even in the evening he distributes provisions.

28. All these sons of Jacob -- twelve. And these words [2said 3to them  1their father]. And he blessed them each. According to  his blessing he blessed them.

29. And he said to them, I am added to  my people. Entomb me with  my fathers in the cave which is in the field of Ephron the Hittite!

30. in the [2cave  1double], in the one before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham acquired; the cave of Ephron the Hittite, for possession of a memorial.

31. There they entombed Abraham and Sarah  his wife. And there they entombed Isaac and Rebekah  his wife. And there they entombed Leah,

32. in a property of the field, and of the cave  being in it, the one from the sons of Heth.

33. And Jacob rested giving orders to his sons. And lifting up  his feet upon the bed he failed. And he was added to  his people.  

## Genesis 50

1.  Jacob Entombed in Mamre And Joseph falling upon the face  of his father, wept over him, and kissed him.

2. And Joseph assigned to his servants, to the embalmers to embalm  his father. And [3embalmed 1the 2embalmers]  Israel.

3. And they accomplished embalming him in forty days, for thus they counted down the days of the burial. And [2mourned 3him 1Egypt] seventy days.

4. And when [3went by 1the 2days] of the mourning, Joseph spoke to the mighty ones of Pharaoh, saying, If I found favor before you, speak into the ears of Pharaoh! saying,

5.  My father bound me by an oath before  his coming to an end, saying, In the memorial which I dug myself, in the land of Canaan, there entomb me! Now then, ascending, I will entomb  my father, and I will return back.

6. And Pharaoh said  to Joseph, Ascend, entomb  your father! just as he bound you by an oath.

7. And Joseph ascended to entomb  his father. And went up with him all the servants of Pharaoh, and the elders  of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

8. and all the whole family of Joseph, and  his brothers, and all the house hold  of his father, and the kin.  And the sheep and the oxen were left behind in the land of Goshen.

9. And went up with him also chariots and horsemen. And [3became 1the 2camp 5great 4exceedingly].

10. And they came upon the threshing-floor of Atad, which is on the other side of the Jordan. And they lamented him by beating the breast, great and strong, exceedingly. And he made the mourning  of his father seven days.

11. And [6saw 1the 2inhabitants 3of the 4land 5of Canaan] the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad. And they said, [4mourning 3a great 1This 2is] to the Egyptians. On account of this they called the name  of that place, Mourning of Egypt, which is on the other side of the Jordan.

12. And [2did 3to him 4thus  1his sons], as he gave charge to them.

13. And [2took 3him  1his sons] into the land of Canaan. And they entombed him in the [2cave  1double] which Abraham acquired; the cave for a possession of a memorial from Ephron the Hittite, over against Mamre.

14. And Joseph returned to Egypt, himself and  his brothers, and all the ones going up with him to entomb  his father.

15. [5knowing 1And 2the 3brothers 4of Joseph] that [2died  1their father], said, Lest at any time [2should resent 3us 1Joseph], and with a recompense, recompense to us all the bad things which we demonstrated against him,

16. that they having come to Joseph, said,  Your father bound us by an oath before  he came to an end, saying,

17. So say to Joseph, You forgive them the injustice and  their sin! for the wicked way they demonstrated against you. And now you accept the injustice of the attendants of the God  of your father! And Joseph wept during their speaking to him.

18. And coming to him, they said, See! we are your servants.

19. And [2said 3to them 1Joseph], Do not fear!  for [2of God 1I am].

20. You planned concerning me for evil,  but God planned concerning me for good, that  it should be as it is today, that he might maintain [2people 1many].

21. And he said to them, Do not fear! I will maintain you, and  your residence. And he comforted them, and spoke of them in the heart.

22. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and  his brothers, and all the whole family  of his father. And Joseph lived [3years 1a hundred 2ten].

23. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children unto the third generation. And the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born upon Joseph's thighs.

24. And Joseph said to his brothers, saying, I die, and visiting, [2will visit 3you  1God], and lead you from out of  this land, into the land which [2swore by an oath  1God] to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

25. And Joseph bound by an oath the sons of Israel, saying, In the visitation in which God will visit you, even you shall join in carrying off  my bones from here with you.

26. And Joseph came to an end -- [3years old 1a hundred 2ten]. And they entombed him, and they placed him in the coffin in Egypt.
