## Jeremiah 1

1.  Jeremiah Appointed Prophet The saying  of God which came unto Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who dwelt in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.

2. As [3came 1the word  2of God] to him in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, [4year 3thirteenth 1in 2the] of his kingship.

3. And it took place in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.

4. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

5. Before  my shaping you in the belly I knew you; and before  your coming forth from out of the womb I sanctified you; [3prophet 4unto 5nations 1I appointed 2you].

6. And I said, O Being One, Master, O lord, behold, I do not know how to speak, for [3younger 1I 2am].

7. And the lord said to me, Do not say that! [3younger 1I 2am]. For to all whom ever I should send you, you shall go; and according to all as much as I should give charge to you, you shall speak.

8. You should not be fearful from in front of them, for [2with 3you 1I am],  to rescue you, says the lord.

9. And the lord stretched  his hand to me, and touched  my mouth. And the lord said to me, Behold, I have placed  my words in  your mouth.

10. Behold, I have ordained you today over nations, and over kingdoms, to root out, and to raze, and to loosen, and to rebuild, and to plant.

11. And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, [2staff 1A walnut].

12. And the lord said to me, [2well 1You have seen]; for I am vigilant over  my words  to do them.

13. And [3came to pass 1the word 2of the lord] of a second time to me, saying, What do you see? and I said, A kettle being fired up, and the face of it towards the face of the north.

14. And the lord said to me, From the face of the north shall burn away the evils upon all the ones dwelling in the land.

15. For behold, I call together all the kingdoms of the north, says the lord; and they shall come, and [2shall put 1each]  his throne upon the thresholds of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all the walls  round about, and upon all the cities of Judah.

16. And I shall speak to them with judgment concerning all  their evil, as they abandoned me, and they sacrificed to strange gods, and did obeisance to the works  of their hands.

17. And you, gird  your loin and rise up, and speak to them all as much as I should give charge to you! You should not be fearful from in front of them, nor should you be terrified before them, for [3with 4you 1I 2am]  to rescue you, says the lord.

18. Behold, I have made you in  today's day as [2city 1a fortified], and as [2wall 3of brass 1a fortified] all together against the kings of Judah, and  its rulers, and to the people of the land.

19. And they shall wage war against you; but in no way shall they be able to prevail against you, because [3with 4you 1I 2am]  to rescue you, said the lord.  

## Jeremiah 2

1.  Israel Abandons The LORD And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

2. Go, and yell into the ears of Jerusalem! saying, Thus says the lord, I remembered the mercy of your youth, and the love of your consecration,  for you to follow after the holy one of Israel, says the lord;

3. Holy Israel to the lord, the beginning of his offspring. All the ones devouring him shall offend; evils shall come upon them, says the lord.

4. Hear the word of the lord, O house of Jacob, and every family of the house of Israel!

5. Thus says the lord, What [4find  3fathers 2did your 5in 6me 1trespass] that they left far from me, and went after the vain things, and acted in folly?

6. And they said not, Where is the lord, the one directing us from out of the land of Egypt, the one steering us in the wilderness, in [4land 1a vast 2and 3untrodden], in a land waterless and unfruitful, in a land in which no [2traveled through 3in 4it 1man], and no [2dwelt 1man] there?

7. And I led you unto  Carmel,  to eat the fruits of it, and the good things of it. And you entered, and defiled  my land; and  my inheritance you made into an abomination.

8. The priests said not, Where is the lord? And the ones resisting the law have not made acknowledgment to me; and the shepherds were impious to me; and the prophets prophesied  by Baal, and [2after 3unprofitable things 1they went].

9. On account of this, still I will arbitrate for you, says the lord; and for the sons  of your sons I will arbitrate.

10. For go into the islands of the Chittim, and see! And [2unto 3Kedar 1send], and comprehend exceedingly! And see! if [2have taken place 1such things]

11. if [2changed 1nations] their gods, and these are not gods!  But my people changed  their glory by which they do not derive benefit.

12. [3is amazed 1The 2heaven] by this, and shuddered over it much, exceedingly, says the lord.

13. For two and wicked things [2did  1my people] to me; they abandoned the spring of water of life, and they dug for themselves cisterns having been broken, the ones which are not able [2water 1to hold].

14.  [3a servant 1Is 2Israel] or [2native-born 1is he]? Why did [2for 3plunder 1he become]?

15. Upon him [2roar 1the lions], and [6gave out  7their voice 1the ones who 2ordered  3his land 4for 5extinction]. And  his cities they razed so as for  no one to dwell.

16. And the sons of Memphis and Tahapanhes knew you, and were mocking you.

17. Were not these things done to you for your forsaking me, says the lord  your God?

18. And now, what is it to you and the way of Egypt,  to drink the water of Sihor? And what is it to you in the way of the Assyrians,  to drink water of the rivers?

19. [2shall correct 3you  1Your defection], and  your evil shall reprove you. And know and see that [3is bitter 4to you  1your forsaking 2me]! says the lord  your God. And I thought not well in you, says the lord  your God.

20. For from the eon you broke  your yoke, and tore up  your bonds. And you said, I will not serve, but I will go upon every [2hill 1high], and underneath every [2tree 1shady]; there I will disperse in  my harlotry.

21. But I planted you a grapevine bearing fruit -- all true. How are you turned into bitterness --  [2grapevine  1a strange]?

22. If you should wash in bleach, and should multiply [2to yourself 1soap], still you are spotted in  your iniquities before me, says the lord.

23. How will you say, I was not defiled, and [2after  3Baal 1I went not]? Behold  your ways in the cemetery, and know what you did! [3in the evening 1Her voice 2shrieks].

24.  Her ways widen over waters of the wilderness; in the desires of her soul she was being carried by the wind; she was delivered up to them, who will turn her? All the ones seeking her shall not tire; in  her humiliation they shall find her.

25. Turn  your foot from [2way 1the rough], and  your throat from thirst!  But she said, I will be manly. For I loved strangers, and [2after 3them 1went].

26. As shame of a thief whenever he should be captured, so shall [4be ashamed 1the 2sons 3of Israel]; they, and  their kings, and  their rulers, and  their priests, and  their prophets.

27. [2to the 3tree 1They said] that, [4father 3my 2are 1You]; and to the stone, You engendered me. And they turned [2against 3me 1their backs], and not their faces. And in the time  of their evils they shall say, Rise up and deliver us!

28. And where are  your gods which you made for yourself? Shall they rise up and deliver you in the time  of your ill-treatment, no. For according to the number  of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the corridors  of Jerusalem, they sacrificed to Baal.

29. Why do you speak to me? You all acted impious, and you all acted lawlessly against me, says the lord.

30. In vain I struck  your children. [2correction 1They received not]. A sword devoured  your prophets, as a lion  annihilating. And you feared not.

31. Hear the word of the lord! Thus says the lord, Did [2a wilderness 1I become]  to Israel, or a land being made barren? Why said  my people, We will not be lorded over, and we shall not come to you any longer?

32. Will [2forget 1the bride]  her bridal ornament, and the virgin  her breastband?  But my people forgot me for days which there is no number.

33. What [3yet 1good device 2will you] apply in  your ways  to seek affection? It will not be thus. But even you did wicked  to defile  your ways.

34. And in  your hands was found blood [2souls 1of innocent]. [3not 4in 5ditches 1I found 2them], but upon every oak.

35. And you said, I am innocent, but turn  his rage from me! Behold, I judge against you, in  your saying, I sinned not.

36. For you are disdained very much of the repeating a second time  of your ways. And from Egypt you shall be disgraced, as you were disgraced by Assyria.

37. For even from here you shall go forth, and  your hands will be upon  your head. For the lord thrusted away  your hope, and you shall not be prosperous in it.  

## Jeremiah 3

1.  The Harlotry of Israel If [2should send away 1a husband]  his wife, and she should go forth from him, and becomes [2man 1to another], shall by returning she return to him yet again? Shall not by defiling [2be defiled  1that woman]? But you fornicated with [2shepherds 1many], and you have returned to me, says the lord.

2. Lift  your eyes unto the upright way, and see where you have not been defiled! [2upon 3the 4ways 1You have sat] for them as a crowbar having been made desolate, and defiled the land in  your harlotries, and in  your evils.

3. And you had [2shepherds 1many] for your occasion for stumbling; the appearance of a harlot became to you; you cast shame to all.

4. Was it not until now you called me even, Father? and, Head  of your virginity?

5. Shall it abide into the eon, or shall it be guarded for victory? Behold, you spoke and did  these evils, and have prevailed. 

6.  The LORD Divorces Israel And the lord said to me in the days of Josiah the king, You saw what [4did 5to me 1the 2house  3of Israel]. She went upon every [2mountain 1high], and underneath every tree of the woods, and she committed harlotry there.

7. And I said after  her committing harlotry all these things, [2to 3me 1Turn]! And she turned not. And [4saw  5her breach-of-contract 1the 2 covenant-breaker 1Judah].

8. And I beheld (for on account of all of which she was overtaken by them [4committed adultery 1the 2house  3of Israel], and I sent her out and gave to her a scroll certificate of divorce into  her hands) that [4feared not 1the 2covenant-breaker 3Judah], and went and committed harlotry even herself.

9. And [2was 3nothing to her  1her harlotry]; and she committed adultery with the wood and the stone.

10. And in all these things [4turned not 5to 6me 1the 2covenant-breaker 3Judah] with [2whole  3heart 1her], but with a lie.

11. And the lord said to me, [2justified  3her soul 1Israel] above the covenant-breaker Judah.

12. Go and read  these words towards the north! And you shall say, Return to me, O house  of Israel, says the lord! And in no way shall I firmly fix  my face against you. For [2merciful 1I am], says the lord, and I shall not be infuriated with you into the eon.

13. Only know  your iniquity! For it is against the lord  your God you acted impious, and dispersed  your ways unto strangers underneath every tree of the woods;  but my voice you obeyed not, says the lord. 

14.  The Gathering of Israel from All Nations Return, [2sons 1O revolting], says the lord! For I shall lord over you. And I shall take you, one from out of a city, and two from out of a family, and I will bring you into Zion.

15. And I will appoint to you shepherds according to  my heart, and they shall tend you, tending with higher knowledge.

16. And it will be if you should be multiplied, and should grow upon the land, says the lord, in  those days, they shall not say any more, Ark of the covenant of holy Israel. It shall not ascend upon the heart, nor be named, nor shall it be examined, and it shall not be done any more.

17. In  those days and in  that time they shall call  Jerusalem, The throne of the lord; and shall be brought together unto her all the nations; and they shall not go any more after the [2thoughts  3of their heart  1wicked].

18. In  those days [4shall come together 1the 2house 3of Judah] with the house  of Israel. And they shall come together from the land of the north, and from all the places upon the earth which I caused [2to inherit  1their fathers].

19. And I said, May it be, O lord, for you said, I shall arrange you among children, and I shall give to you [2land 1a choice] (the inheritance of God almighty) of nations. And I said, [3father 1you shall call 2me]; and [3from 4me 1you shall not 2be turned].

20. Only as [2annuls 1a wife] against the one being with her, so [4annulled 5against 6me 1the 2house 3of Israel], says the lord.

21. A voice from the lips was heard of weeping and supplication of the sons of Israel. For they transgressed in  their ways; they forgot God their holy one.

22. Turn! [2sons 1O turning], and I shall heal  your brokenness. Behold, thus we shall be to you, for you [2the lord  3our God 1are].

23. Really [9for 10a lie 8were 1the 2hills 3and 4the 5powers 6of the 7mountains]. Only through the lord  our God is the deliverance  of Israel.

24. But the shame consumed the efforts  of our fathers from our youth;  their sheep and  their calves,  their sons and  their daughters.

25. We were gone to bed in  our shame, and [2covered 3us  1our dishonor]. For before  our God [4sinned 1we 2and  3our fathers] from our youth until  this day, and we hearkened not of the voice of the lord  our God.  

## Jeremiah 4

1.  The LORD Calls Israel to Return If Israel should return, says the lord, to me, he shall be returned. And if he should remove  his abominations from  his mouth, and [2from  3in front 4of me 1should show reverence],

2. and should swear by an oath, The lord lives, with truth, in equity and in righteousness; then they shall bless [2by 3him 1nations]. And by him they shall give praise to God in Jerusalem.

3. For thus says the lord to the men of Judah, and to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, Plow to yourselves fields prepared for plowing! and you should not sow among thorn-bushes.

4. Circumcise yourselves to your God, and circumcise the hardness of your heart, O men of Judah, and O ones dwelling in Jerusalem! lest [2should go forth 3as 4fire  1my rage], and shall be kindled, and there will not be  one extinguishing from in front of the wickednesses of your practices. 

5.  The Coming Destruction of Jerusalem Announce in  Judah, and hearken in Jerusalem! Say! Signify with a trumpet unto the land! Cry out great! Say! Be gathered together! and, We should enter into the [2cities  1walled].

6. In taking up your things, flee unto Zion! Hasten, do not stand! for [3evils 1I 2bring] from the north, and [2destruction 1great].

7. [2ascended 1The lion] from out of  his lair, utterly destroying nations. He lifted away and came forth from out of  his place,  to make the earth for desolation; and  your cities shall be demolished, so as to not dwell them.

8. Concerning these things gird yourselves with sackcloths, and lament, and shout! because [5shall not 6be turned 1the 2rage 3of the anger 4of the lord] from you.

9. And it will be in that  day, says the lord, [5shall perish 1the 2heart 3of the 4king], and the heart of the rulers; and the priests shall be amazed, and the prophets shall wonder.

10. And I said, O master, O lord, Surely indeed in beguiling you beguiled  this people, and  Jerusalem, saying, Peace will be to you; whereas [3shall touch 1the 2sword] unto  their soul.

11. In  that time they shall say  to this people, and  to Jerusalem, There is a spirit of addiction to a delusion in the wilderness; the way of the daughter  of my people is not to purity, nor to holiness.

12. A spirit of fullness shall come to me; but now I shall speak my judgments against them.

13. Behold, as a cloud he shall ascend, and [2as 3a blast  1his chariots]. Lighter than eagles are his horses. Woe to us, for we are in misery.

14. Wash [2from 3evils  1your heart], O Jerusalem! that you should be delivered. For how long shall [3exist 4in 5you 1the devices 2of your miseries]?

15. Because a voice of one announcing from out of Dan shall come; and [5shall be heard 1the misery 2from out of 3mount 4Ephraim].

16. Remind nations! Behold, announce in Jerusalem! Confederacies are come from out of a land far off, and they uttered [2against 3the 4cities 5of Judah 1their voices].

17. As ones guarding a field they have come upon her round about; for you neglected me, says the lord.

18.  Your ways and  your practices did these things to you; this is  your evil, for it is bitter, for it touched unto  your heart.

19.  My belly,  my belly aches, and the senses  of my heart. [2is irresistibly led  1My soul]. [2is being thrown into a spasm  1My heart]. I shall not keep silent, for [3the sound 4of a trumpet 2heard  1my soul], a cry of war,

20. and of misery. Conflict is being called upon, for [4is in misery 1all 2the 3land] suddenly. [3languishes 1The 2tent]; [2have been pulled apart  1my hide coverings].

21. For how long shall I see ones fleeing, hearing the sound of a trumpet?

22. For the ones leading  my people [3me 1do not 2know]; [3sons 2foolish 1they are], and not discerning. They are wise  to do evil, but the [2good 1doing] they have not recognized.

23. I looked upon the earth, and behold -- nothing; and into the heaven, and [3not 2were  1its lights].

24. I beheld the mountains, and they was trembling, and all the hills were being disturbed.

25. I looked, and behold, [2did not exist 1a man], and all the birds of the heaven were terrified.

26. I beheld, and behold,  Carmel was desolate, and all the cities being set on fire by fire from the countenance of the lord; and from the countenance of the anger of his rage they were removed from view.

27. Thus says the lord, [5desolate 4will be 1All 2the 3earth]; [4unto completion 1but 2in no way 3will I do it].

28. Upon these things let [3mourn 1the 2earth], and let [4be darkened 1the 2heaven 3above]! Because I have spoken, and I shall not change my mind. I advanced it, and I will not turn from it.

29. From the sound of a horseman, and tightly stretched bow, [3withdrew 1every  2place]; they have entered into the caves, and [2in 3the 4sacred groves 1they were hid]; and [2upon 3the 4rocks 1they ascended]. Every city they abandoned; [2does not 3dwell 4in 5them 1man].

30. And you, what shall you do? If you should put on scarlet, and should be adorned with an ornament of gold; and if you should rub antimony on  your eyes, [2is in 3vain 1your finery]; [2thrusted you away  1your lovers],  [3life 2your 1they seek].

31. For [2a sound 3as 4women travailing 1I heard];  your moaning as one giving birth for the first time. The voice of the daughter of Zion shall faint, and [2shall weaken  1her hands]; saying, Woe am I, for [2fails  1my soul] over the ones being done away with.  

## Jeremiah 5

1.  The Rebellion of Israel Run about in the streets of Jerusalem, and see! And know, and seek in  her squares! if there should be found a man; if there is one having equity, and seeking trust -- and I will be kind to them, says the lord.

2. As the lord lives, they say, On account of this do they not [2with 3lies 1swear by an oath]?

3. O lord,  your eyes look unto trust. You whipped them, and they were not pained. You finished them off entirely, but they did not want to take correction. They solidified  their faces above a rock, and they did not want to turn towards you.

4. And I said, perhaps they are poor, because they are not able. For they do not know the way of the lord, and the equity of God.

5. I will go to the stout men and speak to them, for they recognized the way of the lord, and the equity of God. And behold, with one accord they broke the yoke, they tore up the bonds.

6. On account of this [2smote 3them 1a lion] from out of the forest; and the wolf [3unto  4their houses 1annihilated 2them]; and a leopard acted vigilant over  their cities. All the ones going forth from them shall be hunted; for they multiplied their impiety, they strengthened in  their rejection.

7. What kind [4for these things 1of kindness 2should happen 3to you]? Your sons abandoned me, and they swore by an oath by the ones not being gods. And I have filled them, and they committed adultery, and [2in 3the houses 4of harlots 1rested up].

8. [3horses 2sex-crazed 1They became]; each [2over 3the 4wife  5of his neighbor 1snorting].

9. Shall [4over 5these things 2not 1I 3visit]? says the lord. or [2a nation 1to such] shall not [2take vengeance  1my soul]?

10. Ascend upon  her battlements, and raze! [4unto completion 1But 2you should not 3do it]. Destroy  her supports! for  [2of the lord 1they are not].

11. For in disrespecting they disrespected against me, says the lord, even the house of Israel, and the house of Judah.

12. They have lied to their lord, and they said, [3not so 2are 1These things]; there shall not come upon us bad things, and the sword and hunger we will not see.

13.  Our prophets were into the wind, and the word of the lord does not exist among them. Thus it shall be to them.

14. On account of this, thus says the lord almighty, Because you spoke  this word, behold, I have given  my words into  your mouth as fire, and  this people as wood, and it shall devour them. 

15.  The Coming Destruction Behold, I bring upon you a nation at a distance, O house of Israel, says the lord. [2nation 1A strong], a nation from the eon, a nation of which you shall not hear the voice  of its language.

16. All strong men; his quiver is as a tomb being open.

17. And they shall devour  your harvest, and  your bread loaves. And they shall devour  your sons, and  your daughters. And they shall devour  your sheep, and  your calves. And they shall devour  your vineyards, and  your fig groves, and  your olive groves. And they shall thresh  [2cities  1your fortified], (upon which you rely upon them,) by the broadsword.

18. And it will be in  those days, says the lord  your God, in no way will I appoint you unto completion.

19. And it will be whenever you should say, For what reason did [3do 1the lord  2our God] to us all these things? That you shall say to them, Because you abandoned me, and served strange gods in  your land. Thus shall you serve strangers in a land not of yours.

20. Announce these things unto the house of Jacob, and let it be heard in  of Judah!

21. Hearken indeed to these things, [4people 1O moronish 2and 3heartless]! They have eyes, and they do not see; they have ears, and they do not hear.

22. Will [3me 1you not 2fear], says the lord? or before my face will you not show veneration? the one ordering the sand for a limit to the sea [2order 1as an eternal], and the sea shall not pass over it; and it shall be disturbed but it will not be prevailing; and [2shall resound  1its waves], but shall not pass over it.

23.  But to this people there became [2heart 1an unhearing], and a resistance of persuasion. They turned aside and departed.

24. And they have not said in  their heart, We should indeed fear the lord  our God, the one giving to us [4rain 1the early 2and 3late] according to its season of the fullness of the order of harvest, and he guarded it for us.

25.  Your lawless deeds turned aside these things. And  your sins removed the good things from you.

26. For [2were found 3among  4my people 1impious men]. And [2a snare 1they set] to corrupt men; and they conceive their plan.

27. As a snare having been set is full of birds, so  their houses are full of treachery. On account of this they were magnified, and enriched.

28. They became fat and violated equity. They judged not the case of the orphan, and [2for the case 3of the widow 1they judged not].

29. Shall I not [2for 3these  1watch], says the lord? or to [2a nation 1such] shall I not avenge  my soul?

30. A change of state and causes for shuddering was taken place upon the earth.

31. The prophets prophesied unjustly, and the priests clapped  their hands; and  my people have loved it so. And what will you do in the times after these things?  

## Jeremiah 6

1.  Destruction from the North Grow in strength, O sons of Benjamin, from the midst  of Jerusalem! And in Tekoa signify by trumpet! And over Beth-haccerem lift a sign! For bad things look from the north, and [2destruction 1great] is happening.

2. And [2shall be removed  1your haughtiness], O daughter of Zion.

3. [3unto 4her 2shall come 1Shepherds] and  their flocks; and they shall pitch [2against 3her 1tents] round about. And [2shall tend 1each]  with his hand.

4. Make preparations against her for war! Rise up! for we should ascend upon her at midday. Woe to us, for [3has declined 1the 2day], for [5fail 1the 2shadows 3of the 4day].

5. Rise up! for we should ascend at night, and utterly destroy  her foundations.

6. For thus says the lord of the forces, Cut down  her trees! Discharge [2against 3Jerusalem 1a force], O [2city 1lying]! Complete tyranny is in her.

7. As [2cools 1a well] its water, so [2cools 1evil] her. Impiety and misery shall be heard in her before her face always.

8. In misery and with a whip you shall be corrected, O Jerusalem, lest [2should depart  1my soul] from you; lest I should make you an untrodden land, which shall not be settled in.

9. For thus says the lord of the forces, Glean! Glean [4as 5a grapevine 1the 2remnants  3of Israel]! Return as one gathering the vintage returns unto  his basket!

10. To whom should I speak, and testify, and he shall hearken? Behold, [2are uncircumcised  1their ears], and they are not able to hear. Behold, the word of the lord became to them as a scorning; in no way shall they be willing to hear it.

11. And  [2my rage 1I filled], and I waited, but not finished them off entirely. I will pour out upon the simple ones outside, and upon the gathering of young men together; for man and woman shall be seized; the elder with the one full of days.

12. And [2shall be transferred  1their houses] to others, with fields and  their wives together. For I will stretch out  my hand against the ones dwelling  this land, says the lord.

13. For from their small and unto great all have completed lawless deeds; from the priest and unto false prophet, all acted falsely.

14. And they repaired the destruction  of my people treating it with contempt, and saying, Peace. And where is peace?

15. They were shamed for they failed; but neither as ones being disgraced were they disgraced; and  their dishonor they knew not. On account of this they shall fall in  their downfall, and in time of their visitation they shall perish, said the lord.

16. Thus says the lord, Stand upon the ways, and behold! and ask [2roads 3of the lord 1of eternal]! and see what kind is the [2way  1good]! and proceed in it! and you will find purification to your souls. And they said, We will not go.

17. I have placed over you watchmen; hearken to the sound of the trumpet! But they said, We will not hearken.

18. On account of this, [3heard 1the 2nations], and the ones tending  their flocks.

19. Hearken, O earth! Behold, I will bring upon  this people bad things -- the fruit of their rejection. For  my word they heeded not, and  my law they have thrust away.

20. Why [5to me 2frankincense 3from out of 4Sheba 1do you bring], and cinnamon from out of a land far off?  Your whole burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and  your sacrifices have not delighted me.

21. On account of this, thus says the lord, Behold, I impute upon  this people weakness, and [4shall weaken 5in 6it 1fathers 2and 3sons] together; neighbor and  his near one shall perish.

22. Thus says the lord, Behold, a people comes from the north, and nations shall be awakened from the end of the earth.

23. Bow and pike they shall hold. It is audacious, and will not show mercy. Its sound is as the sea swelling up. Upon horses and chariots it shall deploy as fire for war against you, O daughter of Zion.

24. We heard the report of them; [2were disabled  1our hands]; affliction holds us down; pangs as a woman giving birth.

25. Do not go forth into a field, and [3in 4the 5ways 1do not 2proceed]! For a broadsword of the enemies sojourns round about.

26. Daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth! Strew ashes! [3mourning 4as of a beloved one 1You shall observe 2for yourself] by beating the breast pitiably. For suddenly [2shall come 1misery] upon you.

27. [3as an approver 1I have appointed 2you] among peoples being tried; and you shall know in  my trying  their way.

28. All are unhearing, going crookedly; as brass and iron [2all 3being corrupted 1they are].

29. [2failed 1The bellows] at the fire; [2failed 1the lead]; [3in 4vain 1the silversmith 2works silver]; their wickednesses do not melt away.

30. [4silver 3rejected 1Call 2them]! for [2rejected 3them 1the lord].  

## Jeremiah 7

1.  Judah's Idolatry and Immorality The word which came to Jeremiah from the lord, saying, Stand upon the gate of the house of the lord, and read there  this word! And say,

2. Hear the word of the lord all Judea!

3. Thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Set right  your ways and  your practices! and I will settle you in  this place.

4. Rely not upon yourselves with [2words 1lying], for  thoroughly they will not benefit you in your saying, The temple of the lord, [2the temple 3of the lord 1it is].

5. For if in setting right, you should set right  your ways, and  your practices, and in doing you should execute equity between a man and between  his neighbor,

6. and [3the foreigner 4and 5orphan 6and 7widow 1you should not 2tyrannize over]; and [4blood 3innocent 1you should not 2pour out] in  this place; and [3after 4strange gods 1you should not 2go] for your hurt;

7. then I will settle you in  your place, in the land which I gave to your fathers from the eon, and unto the eon.

8. But since you rely upon [2words 1lying], from where you will not be benefitted;

9. and you murder, and you commit adultery, and steal, and swear upon an oath unjustly, and burn incense  to Baal, and go after strange gods whom you do not know,

10. it is to be wickedness to you. And you came and stood before me in the house which [2is called  1my name] upon in it. And you said, We have kept a distance  to do all  these abominations.

11. [2is not 3a cave 4of robbers  1My house], of which [2is called  1my name] upon in it there before you. And behold, I have seen, says the lord.

12. For go unto  my place! the one in Shiloh, where I encamped  my name before it there prior. And see what I did to it because of the countenance of evil of my people Israel!

13. And now, because you have done all  these works, and I spoke to you, and [3not 1you heard 2me]; and I called you, and you were not responding;

14. I also will do to this house (of which [2is called  1my name] upon in it, upon which you relied upon it, and the place which I gave to you and to your fathers,) as I did to Shiloh.

15. And I will throw you away from my face, as I threw away  your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.

16. And you, do not pray for  this people! and do not petition  to show them mercy! and do not make a vow! and do not come forward to me concerning them! for I will not listen to you.

17. Or do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?

18.  Their sons collect together wood, and  their fathers kindle a fire, and  their women knead dough  to make cakes to the military of the heaven; and they offered libations to strange gods, that they should provoke me to anger.

19. Do [2not 4me 1they 3provoke] to anger, says the lord? Do they not provoke themselves that [2should be disgraced  1their faces]?

20. On account of this, thus says the lord, Behold, [2anger 3and 4rage 1my] is poured upon  this place, and upon the men, and upon the cattle, and upon every tree of the field, and upon the produce of the land; and it shall be kindled and not extinguished.

21. Thus says the lord,  [2your whole burnt-offerings 1Gather together] with  your sacrifices, and eat meats!

22. For I spoke not to  your fathers, and I did not give charge to them in the day I led them from out of the land of Egypt concerning whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.

23. But only  this saying gave I charge to them, saying, Hearken to  my voice! and I will be to you for a God, and you will be to me for a people. And go in all  my ways! in which ever I should give charge to you, so even it might be good to you.

24. And they did not listen to me, and they did not take heed with their ear, but they went by the thoughts  [3heart 1of their  2evil]; and they became for the rear, and not for the front.

25. From which day [2went forth  1their fathers] from out of the land of Egypt, and until  this day, even I sent to you all  my servants of the prophets by day; and at dawn also I sent.

26. And they did not listen to me, and [2did not 3take heed  1their ear], and they hardened  their neck above  their fathers.

27. And you shall say to them this  word, and they will not listen to you. And you shall call them, and they will not respond to you.

28. And you shall say to them, This is the nation which hearkened not to the voice of the lord  their God, nor received instruction. [2failed  1Trust] from their mouth.

29. Shear  your head, and throw away! And take upon your lips wailing! for the lord rejected and thrust away the generation  doing these things. 

30.  The Shrine of Tophet For [4did 1the 2sons 3of Judah]  wicked before me, says the lord. They arranged  their abominations in the house which [2is called  1my name] upon it,  to defile it.

31. And they built the shrine  of Tophet, which is in the ravine of the son of Hinnom,  to incinerate  their sons and  their daughters by fire; which I did not give charge to them, and did not consider in  my heart.

32. On account of this, Behold, days come, says the lord, and they shall not say any more, Shrine  of Tophet, and Ravine of the Son of Hinnom, but, The Ravine of the ones Being done away with. And they shall entomb in  Tophet, on account of  [2not 3existing 1a place].

33. And [4will be 1the 2dead  3of this people] for food to the birds  of heaven, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and there will not be one frightening them away.

34. And I will depose from out of the cities of Judah, and from out of the corridors of Jerusalem the voice of ones being glad, and the voice of ones rejoicing, the voice of the groom, and the voice of the bride; for [5for 6desolation 4will be 1all 2the 3land].  

## Jeremiah 8

1.  Israel Refuses to Repent In  that time, says the lord, They shall bring forth the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones  of its rulers, and the bones of the priests, and the bones  of their prophets, and the bones of the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, from out of  their burying-places.

2. And they shall freshen them to the sun, and to the moon, and to all the stars, and to all the military of the heaven, which they loved, and which they served, and whom they went after them, and whom they held to, and to whom they did obeisance to them. They shall not be lamented, and they shall not be entombed. And they will be for an example on the face of the earth.

3. For they took  death rather than  life, even to all the ones remaining to the ones being left behind from  that generation, in every place of which ever I shall push them there.

4. For thus says the lord, Shall the one falling, not be raised up? or the one turning, not return?

5. Why turned  this people [2rejection 1in an impudent], and they hold firmly to their resolve, and they do not want  to return?

6. Give ear indeed, and hearken! [2not 3rightly 1Will they] speak? There is not a man repenting from  his evil, saying, What did I do? [3stopped 1The one 2running] from  his race, as a horse sweating in his snorting.

7. Even the stork in the heaven knew  her time, and the turtle-dove and the swallow of the field. The sparrows guard the times of their entrances.  But my people knew not the judgments of the lord.

8. How shall you say that, [3wise 2are 1We], and the law of the lord [2with 3us 1is]? For [4vain 3became 2rush reed pen 1the lying] to the scribes.

9. [2are ashamed 1The wise men], terrified, and convicted; for the word of the lord they rejected; what wisdom is in them?

10. On account of this, I give  their wives to others, and  their fields to the heirs. For from small unto great all [2a fondness of money 1pursue]. And from prophet unto priest all commit lies.

11. And treating the broken daughter  of my people with dishonor, saying, Peace peace; and there was not peace.

12. They have been shamed, for [2an abomination 1they did]. And with shame they were not ashamed, and to be ashamed they did not know. On account of this they shall fall in the midst of ones falling. In the time of his visit they shall fall, says the lord.

13. And they shall gather  of their produce, says the lord. There is no grape on the grapevines, and there are no figs on the fig-trees, and the leaves have flown down.

14. For why do we sit? Come together, and we should enter into the [2cities  1fortified], and we should be disowned there; for  God disowned us, and gave us to drink water of bile, for we sinned before him.

15. We have gathered together for peace, and there were no good things in the time of healing, but behold, anxiety.

16. From out of Dan we shall hear the sound [2swift 3horses 1of his]. From the sound of snorting of the ones riding his horses [4shall be shaken 1all 2the 3land]. And he shall come and devour the land, and the fullness of it -- the city, and the ones dwelling in it.

17. For behold, I send out against you serpents putting to death, ones which are not charmed; and they shall bite you;

18. incurably with the grief of your heart being perplexed.

19. Behold, the sound of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land far off.  [2the lord 3not 1Is] in Zion? or [3king 2no 1is] there? For they provoked me to anger by  their idolatrous carvings, and by [2vanities 1strange].

20. [2went 1Summer]; [2passed 1harvest], and we have not been delivered.

21. Upon destruction of the daughter of my people I have been enveloped in darkness; in perplexity [2prevailed over 3me 1pangs] as a woman giving birth.

22. And  [3balm 2no 1is] in Gilead? and [3physician 2no 1Is] there? Why did [2not 3ascend 1a healing] for the daughter of my people?  

## Jeremiah 9

1.  The LORD Leaves His People Who will give my head water, and my eyes a spring of tears, that I shall weep for  [2my people 1this] day and night, the ones being slain of the daughter of my people?

2. Who shall give to me [3of 4the 5wilderness 1a post house 2at the end]? for I shall leave  my people, and I shall go forth from them, for they all commit adultery; a convocation of ones annulling covenant.

3. And they stretched tight  their tongue as a bow; a lie and no trust grows in strength upon the earth. For [2from 3evils 4unto 5evils 1they went], and [2me 3not 1they knew], says the lord.

4. [2each 4of  5his neighbor 1Let 3take guard], and [3upon 4their brethren 1let them not 2rely]! For every brother [2with the heel 1shall stomp], and every friend [2deceitfully 1shall go].

5. Each [2against  3his friend 1shall mock]. [3truth 1In no way 2shall they speak]. [2has learned  1Their tongue] to speak falsely. They wronged, and stopped not  to turn back.

6. Interest upon interest, treachery upon treachery; they have not wanted to behold me, says the lord.

7. On account of this, Thus says the lord of the forces, Behold, I shall set them on fire, and try them. What will I act before the face of the wickedness of the daughter of my people?

8. [3arrow 2is a piercing  1Their tongue]; [4deceitful 1the 2words  3of their mouth]; [3to 4his neighbor 1one speaks 2peaceably], and in himself he has  hatred.

9. Shall [3upon 4these 1I not 2visit], says the lord? or, [5on 7a people 6such 3not 1shall 4take vengeance  2my soul]? 

10.  A Lamentation Over Jerusalem Concerning the mountains, take up a lamenting! and for the roads of the wilderness, a wailing! For they failed by there not being men. They heard not the sound of the existence of winged creatures of the heaven. And  the cattle receded -- they were set out.

11. And I will give  Jerusalem for displacement, and for a home of dragons. And the cities of Judah [2for 3extinction 1I will appoint], so as  to not be dwelt in.

12. Who is the [2man  1discerning]? then let him perceive this! And the word of the mouth of the lord is with him, let him announce to you on account of why [3was destroyed 1the 2land]! It was lit on fire as a wilderness, so as  to not travel through it.

13. And the lord said to me, On account of  their abandoning  my law which I put before their face, and they have not hearkened to  my voice;

14. but went after the things pleasing  their heart -- the evil thing; and after the idols which [2taught 3them to worship  1their fathers].

15. On account of this, thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them distresses, and I will cause them to drink water of bile.

16. And I will disperse them among the nations which [2not 1they knew], nor  their fathers. And I will send [3as a successor 4upon 5them 1the 2sword], until  they are completely consumed by it.

17. Thus says the lord, Call the wailing women and let them come! And to the wise women send, and let them utter their voice!

18. And let them take upon you a lamentation! And let [2lead down  1your eyes] tears! And  [2your eyelids 1let] flow water!

19. For a voice of lament was heard in Zion, saying, O how we became in misery. We were disgraced very much, for we abandoned the land, and threw away  our tents.

20. Hear indeed, O women, the word of God! And let [2receive  1your ears] the words of his mouth! And teach  your daughters a lamentation! and let every woman teach  her neighbor wailing!

21. For [2ascended 1death] through  your windows; it entered into  your land  to obliterate infants outside, and young men from the squares.

22. And [4will be 1the 2dead  3of men] for an example upon the face of the plain  of your land; and as grass after being mowed, and there will not be  one gathering.

23. Thus says the lord, Let not [2boast 1the 2wise man] in  his wisdom! And let not [3boast 1the 2strong man] in  his strength! And let not [3boast 1the 2rich man] in  his riches!

24. But in this [2let him boast  1boasting]! To perceive and to know me, that I am the lord, the one having mercy, and judgment, and righteousness upon the earth. For [2is in 3these things  1my will], says the lord.

25. Behold, days come, says the lord, and I will visit upon all having been circumcised of their uncircumcision;

26. upon Egypt, and upon Judah, and upon Edom, and upon the sons of Ammon, and upon the sons of Moab, and upon every one shaving round about his face -- of the ones dwelling in the wilderness. For all the nations are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the house of Israel uncircumcised of their heart.  

## Jeremiah 10

1.  A Warning against Vain Idols Hear the word of the lord! which he spoke to you, O house of Israel.

2. Thus says the lord, [3according to 4the 5ways 6of the 7nations 1Do not 2learn]! And from the signs of the heaven do not fear! for [2are fearing 3them 1nations].

3. For the laws of the nations are vain. An idol is a tree [2from out of 3the 4forest 1being cut], the work of a fabricator, even a molten casting.

4. [3in silver 4and 5gold 2being bedecked 1It is]. By a hammer and nail they stiffen them,

5. and they do not move. [2a silver 3turned piece 1It is] -- they do not speak. Being lifted they shall be lifted, for they shall not mount themselves. You should not fear them, for in no way should they do evil, and [2good 1there is no] in them.

6. There is not one likened to you, O lord. Great are you, and great  is your name in  strength.

7. Who shall not fear you, O king of nations? For to you it is becoming. For among all the wise of the nations, and among all  their kingdoms, there is not one likened to you.

8. At the same time [2foolish 3and 4unthinking 1they are]. [4a teacher 5of vanities 1Their 2tree 3is].

9. [2silver 1Amalgamated] from Tarshish; [2shall come 1gold] from Uphaz; and by the hand of goldsmiths [2works 3of craftsmen 1they are all]. [3blue 4and 5purple 1They shall put on 2them].

10. Thus you shall say to them, The gods who [3the 4heaven 5and 6the 7earth 1did not 2make] let them be destroyed from the earth, and from beneath  this heaven!

11. The lord is the one making the earth by  his strength; erecting the world by  his wisdom; and by  his intellect he stretched out the heaven,

12. and the multitude of water in the heaven; and he led clouds from the end of the earth; [2lightnings 3for 4the rain 1he made], and he brought out winds from his treasuries.

13. [3was made moronish 1Every 2man] from knowledge; [3was disgraced 1every 2goldsmith] over  his carved idols; for [2false 1they cast] in a furnace; there is no breath in them.

14. They are vanities, [2works 1mocking]. In the time of their visitation they shall be destroyed.

15. [2is not 1Such] the portion  of Jacob, for the one shaping  all things is he, and Israel is the rod of his inheritance -- the lord of forces is his name. 

16.  The Coming Destruction He gathered [2from outside  1his support] dwelling in choice vessels.

17. For thus says the lord, Behold, I trip up the ones dwelling  this land. And I will squeeze them out so that it should be found.

18. Woe over your destruction, [2is painful  1your wound]. And I said, Really this  is my wound, and it overtook me.

19.  My tent is in miserable condition, it was destroyed; and all  of my hide coverings were pulled apart.  My sons and  my sheep are no more; there is no more place  for my tent, nor a place  for my hide coverings.

20. For the shepherds were unwise, and  [3the lord 1they do not 2seek]. On account of this [4comprehended not 1all 2the 3sheep of the pasture], and are dispersed.

21. [3a sound 4of a report 1Behold 2there comes], and [2quake 1a great] from out of the land of the north,  to order the cities of Judah for extinction, and a bed for ostriches.

22. I know, O lord, that [4is not  3of man 1the 2way] his own; nor shall a man go and keep [2straight 1his goings].

23. Correct us, O lord, only with equity, and not in rage! that [2not 4us few 1you should 3make].

24. Pour out  your rage upon the nations! the ones not knowing you; and upon kingdoms which  [2your name 1called not upon]. For they devoured  Jacob, and completely consumed  Israel, and  [2his pasture 1made desolate].  

## Jeremiah 11

1.  Judah Breaks Covenant with The LORD The word  coming from the lord to Jeremiah, saying,

2. Hear the words  of this covenant! And you shall speak to the men of Judah, and to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem.

3. And you shall say to them, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, Accursed is the man who shall not hearken to the words  of this covenant,

4. of which I gave charge to your fathers in the day I led them from out of the land of Egypt, from out of the furnace  of iron, saying, Hearken to  my voice, and do all as much as I give charge to you! And you will be to me for a people, and I will be to you for God.

5. So that I should establish  my oath which I swore by an oath to your fathers,  to give to them a land flowing milk and honey, as  this day. And I answered and said, May it be, O lord.

6. And the lord said to me, Read all  these words in the cities of Judah, and outside of Jerusalem! saying, Hear the words  of this covenant, and do them!

7. For bearing witness together I bore witness to your fathers in the day in which I led them out of the land of Egypt until  this day. Rising early I bore witness saying, Hear  my voice! And they did not hear, and they inclined not  their ear; but they went each in the deformity  [3heart 1of his  2evil]. And [5entered 6unto 7them 1all 2the 3words  4of this covenant] of which I commanded  to be done.

8. But they did not do.

9. And the lord said to me, [2is found 1A conspiracy] among the men of Judah, and among the ones dwelling in Jerusalem.

10. They returned unto the iniquities  of their fathers, of the ones prior, the ones not wanting to listen to  my words. And behold, they went after strange gods,  to serve them; and [4effaced 1the 2house 3of Israel] and the house of Judah,  my covenant which I ordained with  their fathers.

11. On account of this, thus says the lord, Behold, I bring upon them evils of which they shall not be able to come forth from out of them. And they shall cry out to me, and I will not listen to them.

12. And [7shall go 1the cities 2of Judah 3and 4the ones 5dwelling 6in Jerusalem], and they shall cry out to  their gods to whom they burn incense to them; the ones who shall not deliver them in the time  of their evils.

13. For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah. And according to the number of the streets  of Jerusalem you arranged shrines  to burn incense  to Baal.

14. And you, pray not for  this people, and do not petition concerning them with supplication and prayer! For I will not listen in the time in which they call upon me, in the time of their affliction.

15. What [2did the 3one being loved 4in  5my house 6do 1abomination]? Shall vows and [2meats 1holy] remove from you  your evils, or by these will you evade?

16. [6olive tree 4a beautiful 5well-shaded 7to the 8sight 2called 1The lord  3your name]. In the sound of its being lopped [2was lit 1a fire] unto it; [2were made useless  1her tender branches].

17. And the lord of the forces, the one having planted you, spoke [2against 3you 1evils]; against the evils of the house of Israel, and the house of Judah. For they did it to themselves,  provoking me to anger in  their burning incense  to Baal. 

18.  Jeremiah's Life is Threatened O lord, make it known to me! and I shall know. Then I knew  their practices.

19. But I am as a little lamb, guileless, being led  for a sacrifice, not knowing. Against me they devised a device, saying, Come, and we should put wood for  his bread, and we should obliterate him from the land of the living; and  his name in no way shall be remembered any longer.

20. O lord of the forces, judging just things, trying the kidneys and the hearts, may I behold  [2exacted by 3you 1the punishment] on them. For to you I revealed  my right action.

21. On account of this, Thus says the lord against the men of Anathoth, the ones seeking  my life, the ones saying, In no way should you prophesy in the name of the lord, and if you do not agree you shall die by  our hands.

22. On account of this, thus says the lord of the forces, Behold, I will make a visit unto them.  Their young men [2by 3the sword 1shall die]; their sons and  their daughters shall come to an end in famine.

23. And [2left 1there will not be] of them. For I will bring evils upon the ones dwelling in Anathoth, in the year of their visitation.  

## Jeremiah 12

1.  Jeremiah Questions God You are righteous, O lord, that I may plead to you. [4only 5concerning judgments 1I will speak 2to 3you]. Why is it that the way of the impious prospers? [5prospered 1All 2the ones 3disrespecting 4in wickedness].

2. You planted them, and they were rooted. They produced children, and they produced fruit. [3near 2are 1You]  their mouth, and at a distance from  their kidneys.

3. And you, O lord, know me. You have tried  my heart before you. Gather them as a flock for a sacrifice, and purify them for the day of slaughter!

4. For how long will [3mourn 1the 2land], and all the grass of the field be dried, because of the evils of the ones dwelling in it? [4were removed from view 1The cattle 2and 3the winged creatures]; for they said, [2shall not 3see  1God] our ways. 

5.  God Answers Jeremiah Your  feet run, and they cause you to faint. How will you make preparations to ride upon horses? and [2in 3the land 4of your peace 1you have relied]. How will you do in the neighing of the Jordan?

6. For even  your brethren and the house  of your father, even they disregarded you; and they yelled out; [2at  3your rear 1they assembled]; you should not trust in them when they speak with you good words.

7. I have abandoned  my house; I let go  of my inheritance; I gave the one being loved of my soul into the hands of her enemies.

8. [2became  1My inheritance] to me as a lion in the forest; she uttered [2against 3me  1her voice]; on account of this I detested her.

9. Is not the cave of a hyena  my inheritance to me, the cave round about her against her? Proceed, bring together all the wild beasts of the field, and let them come  to eat her!

10. [2shepherds 1Many] corrupted  my vineyard, they tainted  my portion; they made [2portion 1my desirable] for [2wilderness 1an untrodden].

11. It was appointed for extinction by destruction; on account of me [5in extinction 4was obliterated 1all 2the 3land], for there is no man putting it to heart.

12. Upon every mountain pass in the wilderness [2came 1the ones causing misery]. For the sword of the lord shall devour from one tip of the land unto the other tip of the land; there is no peace to all flesh.

13. You sowed wheat, and [2thorn-bushes 1harvested].  Their lots shall not benefit them. Be ashamed of your boasting, because of scorn before the lord!

14. For thus says the lord, Concerning all the [2neighbors  1wicked] of the ones touching  my inheritance, which I portioned to my people Israel -- behold, I draw them away from  their land, and  Judah I will cast out from the midst of them.

15. And it will be after  [2casting 4out 1my 3them], I will return, and I will show mercy on them, and I will settle them each in  his inheritance, and each in  his land.

16. And it will be if in learning they should learn the way  of my people,  to swear by an oath to my name, saying, As the lord lives; as they taught  my people to swear by an oath to Baal, then they shall be edified in the midst  of my people.

17. But if they should not return, then I shall lift away that nation by removal and destruction, says the lord.  

## Jeremiah 13

1.  The Loincloth Thus says the lord, Proceed and acquire for yourself [2loincloth 1a flaxen linen], and put it around  your loin! and  [3water 1you shall not 2go through].

2. And I acquired the loincloth according to the word of the lord, and I put it around  my loin.

3. And came to pass the word of the lord to me of a second time, saying,

4. Take the loincloth, the one around  your loin, and arise, and proceed unto the Euphrates, and hide it there in the hole of the rock!

5. And I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as [2gave charge 3to me 1the lord].

6. And it came to pass after [2days 1many], and the lord said to me, Arise! Proceed unto the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth! the one which I gave charge to you  to hide it there.

7. And I went unto the Euphrates, and I dug, and I took the loincloth from out of the place where I hid it there. And behold, it was ruined, which in no way should it be used for anything.

8. And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

9. Thus says the lord, Thus shall I corrupt the insolence of Judah, and the insolence of Jerusalem;

10.  this great insolence of the ones not wanting to obey  my words, and having gone in straightness  [3heart 1of their  2wicked], and having gone after strange gods,  to serve to them, and  to do obeisance to them; and they will be as  this loincloth which shall not be used yet for anything.

11. For just as [3cleaves 1the 2loincloth] around the loin  of a man, so I cleaved to myself the house  of Israel, and all the house of Judah, says the lord;  to be to me for [2people 1a famous], and for a boasting. And for glory; and they did not hearken to me. 

12.  The Leather Wine Bag And you shall say to the people  this word, Thus says the lord, the God of Israel. Every leather bag shall be filled of wine. And it will be if they should say to you, Is it in not knowing that we shall not know that every leather bag shall be filled with wine?

13. And you shall say to them, Thus says the lord, Behold, I shall fill all the ones dwelling  this land, and  their kings, the ones sitting down of the sons  of David upon  their throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and  Judah, and all the ones dwelling in Jerusalem with strong drink.

14. And I will disperse them, a man and  his brother, and  their fathers, and  their sons in the same way; I will not long after them, says the lord, and I will not spare, and I will not pity at their ruin. 

15.  Threat of Captivity Hear, and give ear, and do not be encouraged! for the lord spoke.

16. Give to the lord your God glory! before the darkening, and before the stumbling  of your feet upon [2mountains 1dark]. And you shall await for light, and there is the shadow of death, and they shall be put into darkness.

17. But if you should not hearken, secretly [2shall weep  1your soul] from in front of insolence; and [2shall lead down  1your eyes] tears. For [4was broken up 1the 2flock 3of the lord].

18. Say to the king! and to the ones being in power, Be humbled, and sit down! for [4was demolished 5from 6your head 2crown 3of glory 1your].

19. The cities, the ones towards the south were closed up, and there was not  one opening. Judah was resettled, they completed in it [2resettlement 1a complete].

20. Lift up  your eyes, O Jerusalem, and behold the ones coming from the north! Where is the flock which was given to you, the sheep of your glory?

21. What shall you say whenever they should visit you, and you taught them [4against 5yourself 1lessons 2for 3rule]? Shall not pangs control you as a woman giving birth?

22. And if you shall say in  your heart, Why have [2met up 3with me 1these things]? On account of the magnitude  of your iniquity [2were uncovered  1your posteriors], to make an example of  your heels.

23. If [2shall change 1the Ethiopian]  his skin, and the leopard  her colors, then you shall be able [2good 1to do] while learning the bad.

24. And I scattered them as sticks being carried by the wind into a wilderness.

25. Thus  your lot and  portion  for your resisting me, says the lord; as you forgot me and hoped upon lies.

26. And I will uncover  your rear unto  your face, and [2shall be seen  1your dishonor].

27. Your adultery, and  your snorting, and the alienation  of your harlotry upon the hills, and in the fields I have seen --  your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem, for you were not cleansed to follow after me. For how long yet?  

## Jeremiah 14

1.  Famine and the Sword Devour Judah And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah concerning the drought.

2. Judea mourned, and  her gates are emptied, and are enveloped in darkness upon the earth; and the cry  of Jerusalem ascended.

3. And  her great men sent  their younger ones for water. They came upon the wells and did not find water. They returned  their receptacles empty.

4. And the works of the land failed, for there was no rain. [3were ashamed 1The 2farmers], they covered  their head.

5. And the hinds in the field gave birth, and abandoned it, for there was no pasturage.

6. [2donkeys 1The wild] stood upon the groves, and drew wind as dragons; [2failed  1their eyes], for there was no grass.

7. Since  our sins opposed us, O lord, do for us because of  your name! For [2are many  1our sins] before you. Against you we sinned.

8. You are the endurance of Israel, O lord, delivering in time of evils. Why did you become as a sojourner upon the earth, and as a native-born turning aside for lodging?

9. Will you be as a man sleeping, or as a man not being able to deliver? But you [2among 3us 1are], O lord, and  your name is called upon us; you should not forget us.

10. Thus says the lord to this people, They loved to move their feet, and spared not, and  God prospered not the way among them. Now [3shall be remembered 1the 2iniquity], and he visited  their sins.

11. And the lord said to me, Do not pray for  this people for good!

12. For if they should fast, I will not listen to  their supplication. And if they should bring whole burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, I will not think well of them. For by sword and by famine [3unto 4death 1I 2will finish them off entirely]. 

13.  The LORD Speaks against the False Prophets And I said, O Being One, O lord. Behold, the prophets prophesy and say, You shall not see a sword, nor shall hunger be among you; for truth and peace I shall appoint upon the land, and in  this place.

14. And the lord said to me, [4lies 1the 2prophets 3prophesy] in  my name. I did not send them, and I did not give charge to them, and I did not speak to them. For [2visions 1lying], and divinations, and omens, and the resolves of their own heart they prophesy to you.

15. On account of this, thus says the lord, concerning the prophets, of the ones prophesying [2in  3my name 1lies], and I did not send them, who say, Sword and famine will not be upon  this land. By [2death 1a diseased] [3shall die 4and 5by 6hunger 7they shall be finished off entirely 1the 2prophets],

16. even the people to whom they prophesy to them. And they will be tossed in the streets of Jerusalem from in front of the sword, and of the famine. And there will not be one entombing them, even  their wives, and  their sons, and  their daughters. And I shall pour out against them  for their evils.

17. And you shall say to them  this word, Lead down [2into  3your eyes 1tears] day and night, and let them not stop! For [2defeat 1by a great 5was defeated 3the daughter 4of my people], even by [3beating 2grievous 1an exceedingly].

18. If I should go forth into the plain, then behold, ones slain by sword. And if I should enter into the city, then behold, the misery of famine. For priest and prophet were gone into a land which they did not know. 

19.  A Supplication to The LORD Did by rejecting you reject  Judah? and [3from 4Zion 2removed itself  1has your soul]? Why did you smite us, and there is no healing for us? We waited for peace, but there was no good; for a time of healing, but behold, only disturbance.

20. We knew, O lord, our sins, the iniquities of our fathers. For we sinned before you.

21. Abate, on account of  your name! You should not destroy the throne of your glory. Remember! you should not efface  your covenant, the one with us!

22.  Is there one among the idols of the nations causing rain, and shall [2the 3heaven 1an idol give] its fullness, no. Is it not you being he, O lord  our God. And we shall wait on you, for you made all these.  

## Jeremiah 15

1.  The LORD will Avenge And the lord said to me, If [4should stand 1Moses 2and 3Samuel] before my face [2is not  1my soul] for them. Send out  this people from my face, and let them go forth!

2. And it will be if they should say to you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall say to them, Thus says the lord, As many as for death, to death; and as many as for sword, to sword; and as many as for famine, to famine; and as many as for captivity, to captivity.

3. And I will avenge against them four forms, says the lord; the sword unto slaughter, and the dogs for tearing in pieces, and the wild beasts of the earth, and the winged creatures of the heaven for solid food and corruption.

4. And I will deliver them up for distresses to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for all which he did in Jerusalem.

5. Who will spare over you, O Jerusalem? And who will show timidity against you? Or, who shall return to say, Peace to you?

6. You turned from me, says the lord; [2back 1you shall go]. And I will stretch out  my hand, and I shall utterly destroy you; and no longer shall I spare them.

7. And I will scatter them in a dispersion in the gates of my people. They were made childless; they destroyed  my people because of  their evils.

8. [2were multiplied  1Their widows] above the sand of the sea; I brought [2against 3the mother 1young men], misery in midday. I cast upon her sudden trembling and anxiety.

9. [4was emptied 1The one 2giving birth to 3seven]. [2suffered misfortune  1Her soul]; [2set  1her sun] even in the middle of the day. She was disgraced and berated. Of the ones remaining of them [2to 3the sword 1I will give] before  their enemies, says the lord. 

10.  Jeremiah's Woe Woe, O mother, as how you bore me a man adjudicating and litigating in all the earth. I derived no benefit, nor did [2benefit 3me 1anyone].  My strength failed among the ones cursing me.

11. May it be, O lord master, of their prospering in a time of their affliction for good against the enemy.

12. Shall it be known that iron and a wrap-around garment of brass  is your strength, no.

13. And  of your treasures I will give an equivalent, on account of all  your sins, and in all  your borders.

14. I will reduce you to slavery round about  your enemies, in the land which you knew not. For a fire has been kindled because of  my rage; [2against 3you 1it shall be kindled].

15. O lord, remember me, and visit me, and acquit me from the ones pursuing me -- not for leniency! Know how I took [2on account of 3you 1scorning]!

16. even by the ones disregarding  your words. Finish them off entirely! and [2will be  1your word] to me for gladness and the joy of my heart. For [2has been called  1your name] upon me, O lord almighty.

17. I sat not in their sanhedrin playing about, but I was cautious from in front of your hand. Alone I sat, for [2with bitterness 1I was filled].

18. Why do the ones grieving me prevail over me?  My wound is substantial, from where shall I be healed? In becoming, it became to me as [2water 1false], not having trust.

19. Because of this, thus says the lord, If you should return, and I should restore you, [2before 3my face 1you shall stand]. And if you should lead out the esteemed from the unworthy, [2as 3my mouth 1you will be]. And they shall return to you; and you shall not return to them.

20. And I will appoint you to this people as [2wall 1a fortified] of brass. And they shall wage war against you, but in no way shall they be able to prevail against you; because [2with 3you 1I am]  to deliver you, and to rescue you, says the lord.

21. And I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked ones, and I will ransom you from the hand of pestilent ones.  

## Jeremiah 16

1.  Judgment and Threat of Exile And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me saying,

2. You should not take a wife, and there shall not be engendered to you a son nor daughter in  this place.

3. For thus says the lord, Concerning the sons and the daughters of the ones being engendered in  this place, and concerning  their mothers  giving them birth, and concerning  their fathers  engendering them in  this land;

4. by [2death 1a diseased] they shall die; they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be entombed; for [2an example 3upon 4the face 5of the 6earth 1they will be]. By the sword they shall fall, and in hunger they shall be finished off entirely. And [2shall be  1their corpses] for food to the wild beasts of the earth, and to the winged creatures of the heaven.

5. Thus says the lord, You should not enter into their revelry, and you should not go in  to lament, and you should not mourn them. For I have removed  my peace from  this people, says the lord, even mercy and charity.

6. And [4shall die 1great 2and 3small] in  this land. They shall not be buried, and they shall not be lamented, they shall not beat their chest for them, nor [2cuts 1shall they make], and they shall not be shaven;

7. and in no way should [2be broken 1bread] in their mourning for consolation over one having died; they shall not give a drink for them of a cup for consolation over his father or his mother.

8. [4into 5a residence 6with a banquet 2shall not 3enter 1You] to sit down with them  to eat and to drink.

9. For thus says the lord  God of Israel, Behold, I depose from out of  this place before  your eyes, and in  your days a voice of joy, and a voice of gladness, the voice of the groom, and the voice of the bride.

10. And it will be whenever you should announce to this people all  these matters, then they shall say to you, Why did the lord speak against us all  these evils? What is  our injustice, and what is our sin which we sinned before the lord  our God?

11. And you shall say to them, Because [2abandoned 3me  1your fathers], says the lord; and they set out after strange gods, and they served to them, and did obeisance to them; and they abandoned me, and  [3my law 1they did not 2keep].

12. And you were wicked above  your fathers. And behold, you [2go 1each] after the things pleasing  your heart -- the evils,  to not obey me.

13. And I will throw you away from  this land, into a land which you knew not -- you and  your fathers. And you shall serve there strange gods day and night, the ones that shall not grant mercy to you. 

14.  Future Restoration On account of this, behold, days come, says the lord, and [2not 1they shall 4say 3still], As the lord lives, the one leading up the sons of Israel from out of the land of Egypt.

15. But they shall say, As the lord lives, who led the house of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the places where they were pushed out there. And I shall restore them unto  their land which I gave to their fathers.

16. Behold, I send [2fishermen 1many], says the lord, and they shall fish them. And after these I shall send many hunters, and they shall hunt them upon every mountain, and upon every hill, and from out of the holes of the rocks.

17. For  my eyes are upon all  their ways, and [2were not hid  1their offences] before  my eyes.

18. And I shall recompense double  their iniquities, and  their sins upon which they profaned  my land by the decaying flesh  of their abominations, and by  their lawless deeds in which they filled  my inheritance.

19. O lord my strength and my help and my refuge in a day of evils. To you nations shall come from the ends of the earth. And they shall say, O how false [3acquired  2our fathers 1the idols], and there is no [2in 3them 1benefit].

20. Shall [2make 3for himself 1a man] gods, and these are not gods?

21. On account of this, behold, I will make manifest to them [2in  3this time  1my hand]; and I shall make known to them  my power; and they shall know that my name is the lord.  

## Jeremiah 17

1.  Judah's Sin and Punishment Thus says the lord. The sin of Judah is being written with [2stylus 1an iron] with clawed adamantine being carved upon the tablet  of their heart, and upon the horns  of their shrines.

2. even in the remembering of their sons of their shrines and  their sacred groves upon tree woods, upon the [2hills  1high].

3. O mountain in the plain,  of your wealth and all  of you treasures  [2for plunder 1I shall give];  your heights for sin in all  your boundaries.

4. And you shall be forsaken from  your inheritance which I gave to you. And [3to serve 2you 1I will make] to your enemies in the land which you knew not. For [2fire 1you kindled] in  my wrath; unto the eon it shall blaze.

5. Thus says the lord, Cursed is the man who  [2hope 1has] upon man, and shall fix firmly the flesh of his arm, and [3from 4the lord 1should separate  2his heart].

6. And he will be as the tamarisk  in the wilderness; he shall not see whenever [2come  1good things]. But he shall encamp in salty lands, and in a wilderness in a land brackish which is not dwelt.

7. And being blessed is the man who relies upon the lord, and the lord will be his hope.

8. And he shall be as a tree prospering by waters; and upon a moist place he shall shoot his roots; and he will not be fearful whenever [2comes 1sweltering heat]; and there will be for him tree trunks of the woods. In the year of drought he shall not be fearful, and he shall not stop producing fruit.

9. [3is deep 1The 2heart] beyond all things, and man is, who shall know him?

10. I the lord am examining hearts, trying kidneys,  to give to each according to  his ways, and according to the fruits  of their practices.

11. [2speaks out loud 1The partridge], gathering together what she did not give birth. So the man having his riches but not with equity; in the first half of his days his riches will leave him, and at the last half of his days he will be a fool.

12. [2is a throne 3of glory 4being raised up high 5from 6the beginning 1Our sanctuary].

13. The waiting of Israel, O lord, all the ones forsaking you, let them be disgraced! Ones revolting, [2upon 3the 4ground 1let them be written]! for they abandoned the spring of life -- the lord. 

14.  Sanctify the Day of the Sabbath Heal me, O lord! and I shall be healed. Deliver me! and I shall be delivered. For [3my boasting 1you 2are].

15. Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the lord? Let it come!

16. But I tired not following closely after you; and the day of man I desired not. You have knowledge of the things having gone forth through  my lips; [2before 3your face 1it is].

17. You should not be to me for alienation; but one sparing me in [2day 1the evil].

18. May [4be disgraced 1the ones 2pursuing 3me], and may I not be disgraced myself. May they be terrified, but may I not be terrified myself. Bring upon them [2day 1the wicked]! In double destruction destroy them!

19. Thus says the lord to me, Proceed and stand in the gates of the sons of the people! by which [3enter 1kings 2of Judah], and by which they go forth by them, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.

20. And you shall say to them, Hear the word of the lord, O kings of Judah, and all Judea, and all Jerusalem! O ones entering by  these gates.

21. Thus says the lord, Guard  your souls, and do not lift burdens on the day of the Sabbaths! and you should not carry in through the gates of Jerusalem.

22. And do not bring forth burdens from out of your residences on the day of the Sabbaths! And [2any 3work 1you shall not do]. Sanctify the day of the Sabbaths! as I gave charge to your fathers.

23. And they hearkened not, and leaned not  their ear. And they hardened  their neck over  their fathers  to not hear me, and  to not take instruction.

24. And it will be, if you should hearken to me, says the lord,  to not carry in burdens through the gates  of this city in the day of the Sabbaths, and to sanctify the day of the Sabbaths  to not do any work in it,

25. that there shall enter through the gates  of this city kings and rulers sitting upon the throne of David, and mounting upon [2chariots 3and 4horses 1their], they and  their rulers, the men of Judah, and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem. And [2shall be settled  1this city] into the eon.

26. And they shall come from out of the cities of Judah, and round about Jerusalem, and from out of the land of Benjamin, and from out of the plain, and from out of the mountain, and from out of the country to the south, bringing whole burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and incenses, and manna, and frankincense; bringing praise into the house of the lord.

27. And it will be if you should not hearken to me  to sanctify the day of the Sabbaths,  to lift no burdens, and to not enter through the gates of Jerusalem in the day of the Sabbaths; then I will kindle a fire in  her gates; and it shall devour the plazas of Jerusalem, and it shall not be extinguished.  

## Jeremiah 18

1.  The Potter's House The word  coming to Jeremiah from the lord, saying,

2. Rise up and go down unto the house of the potter! and there you shall hear  my words.

3. And I went down unto the house of the potter. And behold, he was making a work upon the stones.

4. And [3failed 1the 2vessel] which he was making with  his hands. And again he made it [2vessel 1into another] as was pleasing before him  to make.

5. And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

6. Shall as  this potter I not be able  to make you, O house of Israel, says the lord? Behold, as the mortar in the hand of the potter, so are you in  my hands, O house of Israel.

7. At end I shall speak unto a nation or unto a kingdom  to lift them away, and  to destroy them.

8. But should [2turn  1that nation] from  their evils, then I shall change my mind concerning the bad things which I devised  to do to them.

9. And at end I shall speak unto a nation and unto a kingdom  to rebuild and  to plant,

10. and they do the wicked things before me,  to not hear  my voice, then I will change my mind concerning the good things which I spoke  to do for them.

11. And now say to the men of Judah, and to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem! Thus says the lord, Behold, I shape against you bad things, and I devise against you a device! Let [3turn 1indeed 2each] from [3way 1his  2evil], and [3good 1make  2your practices] and  your ways!

12. And they said, We will be manly, for after  our turning, we shall go and each [2the things 3pleasing  6heart 4his  5evil 1shall do].

13. On account of this, Thus says the lord, Ask indeed among the nations! who heard such causes for shuddering which [3did 4exceedingly 1virgin 2Israel]?

14. Shall [2fail 3from 4the rock 1nipples], or snow from the Lebanon range? Will [5turn aside 1water 3forcibly 4by a wind 2being brought]?

15. For [2forgot 3me 1my people]. [2in 3vain 1They burned incense], and they shall weaken in  their ways -- [2roads 1eternal];  to mount roads not having a way for going;

16.  to order up  their land for extinction, and [3hissing 1the 2everlasting]. All the ones traveling through it shall be amazed, and shall shake  their head.

17. As [2wind 1a burning] I will scatter them in front of their enemies. The back and not the front I will show to them in a day of their destruction. 

18.  The Plot to Kill Jeremiah And they said, Come, we should devise against Jeremiah a device, for [2shall not 3perish 1the law] from the priest, nor counsel from the discerning, nor the word from the prophet. Come, for we should strike him in the tongue, and we shall not hear all  his words.

19. Hear me, O lord, and hear the voice  of my right action!

20. Shall [2be recompensed 3for 4good things 1evils], no. For they conversed together things against  my soul. Remember my standing in front of you!  to speak [2for 3them 1good],  to turn  your rage from them.

21. On account of this, give  their sons to famine, and gather them into the hands of swords! Let [2become  1their women] childless and widows, and  [2their men 1let] become men being done away with in death, and  their young men falling by sword in war!

22. Let there become a cry in  their houses! You shall bring upon them robbers suddenly; for they took in hand a word to seize me, and [2snares 1they hid] against me.

23. And you, O lord, knew all together  their plan against me for death. You should not acquit  their iniquities; and  [3their sins 4from 5in front 6of you 1you should not 2wipe away]. Let [2come  1their weakness] before you! In the time of your rage deal with them!  

## Jeremiah 19

1.  The Cemetery of the Slaughter Then the lord said to me, Proceed and acquire a pitcher! one being shaped of earthenware from the elders of the people and of the priests.

2. And you shall go forth into the cemetery of the sons of Hinnom, which is at the thresholds of the gate  of Charsith, and read there all the words! which ever I shall speak to you.

3. And you shall say to them, Hear the word of the lord, O kings of Judah, and O ones dwelling Jerusalem! Thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring upon  this place evils, so that all hearing them, [2shall resound  1his ears].

4. Because they abandoned me, and separated from  this place; and they burned incense in it to strange gods who [2did not 3know 1they] and  their fathers; and the kings of Judah filled  this place [2blood 1of innocent].

5. And they built high places  to Baal  to incinerate  their sons in fire, which I did not give charge nor spoke, and did not consider in  my heart.

6. On account of this, days come, says the lord, and they shall not call  this place still, Downfall, and Cemetery of the son of Hinnom, but Cemetery of the Slaughter.

7. And I will slay the counsel of Judah, and the counsel of Jerusalem in  this place; and I will throw them down by the sword before  their enemies, and by the hands of the ones seeking  their lives. And I will give  their dead for food to the winged creatures of the heaven, and to the wild beasts of the earth.

8. And I will order  this city into extinction, and for a hissing. All  coming upon it shall look downcast, and shall whistle over all  its calamity.

9. And they shall eat the flesh  of their sons, and the flesh  of their daughters; and each [2the 3flesh  4of his neighbor 1shall eat] in the citadel, and in the assault in which [2shall assault 3them  1their enemies], and the ones seeking  their life. 

10.  The Broken Pitcher And you shall break the pitcher before the eyes of the men, of the ones going forth with you.

11. And you shall say to them, Thus says the lord, So I will break  this people, and  this city, as [3was broken 2container 1the earthenware], which is not able to be repaired again. And in  Tophet they shall bury, for there is not a place  to bury.

12. Thus I will do, says the lord,  to this place, and to the ones dwelling in it,  to yield up  this city as the one having fallen into ruin.

13. And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah will be as  a place  having fallen into ruin because of the uncleannesses in all the houses in which they burned incense upon the roofs to all the military of the heaven, and offered libations to strange gods.

14. And Jeremiah came from  Downfall, where [2sent 3him 1the lord] there  to prophesy. And he stood in the courtyard of the house of the lord, and he said to all the people,

15. Thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring upon  this city, and upon all  her cities, and upon  her towns, all the evils which I spoke against her, for they hardened  their neck  to not listen to  my commandments.  

## Jeremiah 20

1.  Jeremiah and Pashur And Pashur heard (the son of Immer the priest, and this one was being ordained leader of the house of the lord)  Jeremiah prophesying  these words.

2. And he struck him, and put him into the dungeon which was by the gate of the house of Benjamin, the upper, which was in the house of the lord.

3. And it came to pass in the next morning, and Pashur led out  Jeremiah from the dungeon. And [2said 3to him 1Jeremiah], [3not 5Pashur 2called 1the lord  4your name], but instead, Refugee.

4. Because thus says the lord, Behold, I give you for displacement with all  your friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and  your eyes shall see it. And you and all Judah I will give into the hands of the king of Babylon; and they shall displace them, and shall cut them in pieces with swords.

5. And I will put  all the strength  of this city, and all  its toils, and all the treasures of the king of Judah into the hands of his enemies, and they shall lead them into Babylon.

6. And you and all the ones dwelling in  your house shall go into captivity; and in Babylon you shall die, and there you shall be entombed, you and all  your friends to whom you prophesied lies to them. 

7.  Jeremiah's Complaint You deceived me, O lord, and I was deceived. You held and prevailed. I became for laughter. Every day I continue being sneered at.

8. For [3bitter 4word 2with my 1I shall laugh], [2rebellion 3and 4misery 1I will call upon]; for [4became 1the 2word 3of the lord] for scorning to me, and for taunting all day.

9. And I said, in no way shall I name the name of the lord, and in no way shall I speak yet in  his name. And it became as [2fire 1a burning], blazing in  my bones; and I am weakened from all sides, and I am not able to bear up.

10. For I heard the fault of many gathering together round about, saying, Rise up together against him! And, We should rise up together against him -- all [2men 3friends 1his]. Give heed to  his thought! if he should be deceived, and we shall prevail against him, then we shall take  our vengeance on him.

11. But the lord is with me as [2warrior 1a strengthening]. On account of this they pursued, but [3to comprehend 1they were not 2able]. They were shamed exceedingly; for they did not comprehend their dishonor, which through the eon will not be forgotten.

12. O lord, trying just things, perceiving the kidneys and heart; may I behold the [2by 3you 1punishment] on them. For to you I uncovered  my pleas in defense.

13. Sing to the lord! Praise him! for he rescued the soul of the needy from out of the hand of the most substantial ones.

14. Cursed is the day in which I was birthed in it, the day in which [2gave birth to 3me  1my mother]; let it not be longed for!

15. Cursed is the man  announcing good news to my father, saying, There was birthed to you a male child, [2making merry 1they are].

16. [1Let 3be  2that man] as the cities which the lord eradicated in rage, and he did not repent! Let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shout at midday!

17. For he did not kill me in the womb of my mother, for [2to be 3to me  1my mother] my burying-place, and the womb [2conception 1an everlasting].

18. Why is this that I came forth from out of the womb  to see toils and miseries; and [2continue 3in 4shame  1my days]?  

## Jeremiah 21

1.  The Coming Destruction from Babylon The word  coming from the lord to Jeremiah, when [3sent 4to 5him  1king 2Zedekiah]  Pashur son of Melchiah, and  Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,

2. You ask [3for 4us 1the 2 lord]! for the king of Babylon has set by us; if the lord will do according to all  his wonders, and the king shall go forth from us.

3. And [2said 3to 4them 1Jeremiah], Thus you shall say to Zedekiah,

4. Thus says the lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I turn back the weapons  of warfare which are in  your hands, and by which you wage war with them against the Chaldeans, the ones hemming you in who are outside the wall; and I will gather them into the midst  of this city.

5. And I shall wage war myself against you with a hand being stretched out, and with [2arm 1a fortified] with rage and [2anger 1great].

6. And I will strike all the ones dwelling in  this city, men and the cattle. By [2death 1a great] even they shall die.

7. And after these things, thus says the lord, I will deliver up  Zedekiah king of Judah, and  his servants, and the people, the one surviving in  this city from  death, and from  famine, and from the sword, into the hands of their enemies, of the ones seeking  their lives. And they shall cut them in pieces by the mouth of the sword; I will not spare against them, and in no way shall I pity them.

8. And [2to  3this people 1you shall say], Thus says the lord, Behold, I put before your face the way  of life, and the way  of death.

9. The one being settled in  this city shall die by the sword and by famine; and the one going forth to join with the Chaldeans, the ones hemming you in, shall live; and [2will be  1his life] for spoils, he shall live.

10. For I firmly fixed  my face against  this city for bad, and not for good, says the lord. Into the hands of the king of Babylon it shall be delivered up, and he shall incinerate it by fire. 

11.  Judgment on the House of David O house of the king of Judah, hear the word of the lord!

12. O house of David, Thus says the lord; Arbitrate [2in the morning 1judgment], and straighten out, and rescue the one being torn in pieces from the hand of the one wronging him! so that [2should not 3be lit 4as 5a fire  1my anger], and it should be kindled, and there will not be  one extinguishing it.

13. Behold, I am against you, O one dwelling the valley of Sor; the plain country of the ones saying, Who shall terrify us? Or who shall enter to  our home?

14. And I will look about upon you, and I will kindle a fire in  her forest. And it shall devour all the things round about her.  

## Jeremiah 22

1.  The Word against the King's House Thus says the lord, Go, and go down to the house of the king of Judah! And you shall speak there  this word.

2. And you shall say, Hear the word of the lord, O king of Judah, O one sitting down upon the throne of David, you and  your servants, and  your people, and the ones entering  by these gates!

3. Thus says the lord, Execute equity and righteousness, and rescue the one being plundered from out of the hand of the one wronging him! And the foreigner, and orphan, and widow, do not tyrannize! And do not be impious! And [4blood 3innocent 1you should not 2pour out] in  this place.

4. For if doing you should do  this word, then [2shall enter 3in 4the 5gates  6of this house 1kings] sitting down upon the throne of David, and mounting upon chariots, and horses, they and  their children, and  their people.

5. But if you should not do  these words, according to myself I swear by an oath, says the lord, that [3for 4desolation 2will be  1this house].

6. For thus says the lord against the house of the king of Judah. You are Gilead to me, head  of Lebanon. Should I not make you desolate, cities not being dwelt in?

7. And I will bring upon you an annihilating man, and  his hewing axe. And they shall cut down  [2chosen 3cedars 1your], and shall put them into the fire.

8. And [3shall go 2nations 1many] through  this city. And they shall say each to  his neighbor, Why did the lord do thus to [3city 1this  2great]?

9. And they shall say, Because they abandoned the covenant of the lord  their God, and did obeisance to strange gods, and they served to them.

10. Do not weep for the one having died, nor lament him! Weep! by weeping for the one going forth, for he shall not return again, nor shall he see the land of his fatherland. 

11.  The Word against Shallum For thus says the lord against Shallum, son of Josiah king  of Judea, who reigned for Josiah  his father, who came forth from out of  this place, He shall not return there again.

12. But in the place where I displaced him, there he shall die, and  this land he shall not see again.

13. O the one building his house with no righteousness, and  his rooms without equity; for to him the neighbor works without pay, and  his wage in no way shall he give over to him.

14. You built to yourself a house well-proportioned, with upper rooms ventilated, separated by windows, and being boarded by cedar, and being coated in vermilion.

15. Should you reign, because you are provoked with Ahaz  your father? Shall they not eat and shall they not drink? It is best for you to execute equity and [2righteousness 1fair].

16. They did not know, they did not judge with equity to the humble, nor with equity to the needy. [2this not 1Is] because of [2not 3knowing 1your] me, says the lord?

17. Behold, [2are not  1your eyes] nor  your heart good, but they are for  your desire for wealth, and for the [3blood  2innocent  1pouring out], and for offences, and for murder,  to do them.

18. On account of this, thus says the lord against Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Woe against  this man. In no way should they lament him, saying, O brother. Nor shall they weep over him, saying, Alas, O lord.

19. As the burial of a donkey he shall be buried; being scraped away he shall be tossed beyond the gate of Jerusalem.

20. Ascend unto  Lebanon, and cry out! And [3unto  4Bashan 1give out  2your voice], and yell unto the end of the sea! for [3were defeated 1all  2your lovers].

21. I spoke to you in  your transgression, and you said, I will not hearken. This  is your way from your youth, you hearkened not to  my voice.

22. All  your shepherds shall tend the wind, and  your lovers [2into 3captivity 1shall go forth]; for then you shall be ashamed, and shall be disgraced because of all the ones being fond of you.

23. O one dwelling in  Lebanon, nesting among the cedars, you shall groan in the [2coming 3to you 1griefs], pangs as one giving birth. 

24.  The Word to Coniah As I live, says the lord, Though in coming to pass [6should become 1Coniah 2son 3of Jehoiakim 4king 5of Judah] a seal upon  [2hand  1my right], from there will I pull you out.

25. And I will deliver you up into the hands of the ones seeking  your life, whom you are cautious from in front of them, even into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king  of Babylon, and into the hands of the Chaldeans.

26. And I will throw you and  your mother, the one giving birth to you, into a land of which you were not birthed there; and there you shall die.

27. And unto the land which they made a vow in their souls, there in no way shall they return.

28. Coniah is disgraced as a vessel which there is no need of; for he was cast forth and cast into a land which he did not know.

29. O land, O land, hear the word of the lord!

30. Thus says the lord, Write up  this man [2banished by public proclamation 1as a man]! For in no way should there be anything grown from out of  his seed, a man sitting down upon the throne of David, ruling again in  Judah.  

## Jeremiah 23

1.  Two Kinds of Shepherds O the shepherds, the ones scattering and destroying the sheep  of my pasture.

2. On account of this, thus says the lord, the God of Israel, against the shepherds, the ones tending  my people; You scattered  my sheep, and pushed them out, and did not visit them. Behold, I shall take vengeance upon you, against  [2wicked 3practices 1your].

3. And I will take in the ones remaining  of my people upon all the earth of which place I pushed them there; and I shall place them into  their pasture, and they shall grow and be multiplied.

4. And I shall raise up to them shepherds  tending them, and they shall not be fearful any more, nor shall they be terrified, nor shall they be seeking after, says the lord.

5. Behold, days come, says the lord, and I will raise up to David [2dawn 1a just]; and [2shall reign 1a king], and shall perceive, and shall execute equity and righteousness upon the earth.

6. In  his days Judah shall be delivered, and Israel shall encamp complying. And this  is his name, which [2shall call 3him 1the lord] -- Josedek.

7. On account of this, behold, days come, says the lord, and they will not say any longer, As the lord lives, who led the house of Israel from out of the land of Egypt.

8. But as the lord lives, who led up and gathered all together the seed of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the places of which they were pushed there; and he restored them unto  their land.

9. In the prophets [2was broken  1my heart]; in me [3were shaken 1all  2my bones]; I became as a man being broken, and as a man constrained by wine, from the countenance of the lord, and from the countenance of the beauty of his glory.

10. For [4of adulterers 3is full 1the 2land]. For from the countenance of these things [3mourned 1the 2land]; [5were dried up 1the 2pastures 3of the 4wilderness]; and [2became  1their race] wicked, and  their strength not thus. 

11.  The Wicked Priests and Prophets For priest and prophet were tainted; and in  my house I saw their wickedness, says the lord.

12. On account of this let [2become  1their way] to them for a slip in dimness! And they shall be tripped up and shall fall in it. Because I shall bring upon them bad things in the year of their visitation, says the lord.

13. And among the prophets of Samaria I beheld violations of the laws; they prophesied by Baal, and they misled  my people  Israel.

14. And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen causes for shuddering -- committing adultery and going by lies, and taking hold of hands of wicked ones  [2to not 3be turned 1for each] from  [3way 1his  2wicked]. They [2became 3to me 1all] as Sodom, and the ones dwelling in it as Gomorrah.

15. On account of this, thus says the lord of the forces to the prophets; Behold, I will feed them grief, and I shall give them to drink [2water 1bitter]; for from the prophets of Jerusalem [2came forth 1contamination] to all the land.

16. Thus says the lord the almighty, Do not hearken to the words of the prophets! of the ones prophesying to you. For they frame in folly [2for themselves 1a vision]. From their heart they speak, and not from the mouth of the lord.

17. They say to the ones thrusting away the word of the lord, Peace will be to you; and to all the ones going  by their wants, and to all  going in a delusion of his heart, [2shall not come 3upon 4you 1Evils].

18. For who stood in the garrison of the lord, and beheld and heard  his word? Who gave ear and heard?

19. Behold, a quaking by the lord, and anger shall go forth in a rumbling. [2contracting 3upon 4the 5impious 1It shall come].

20. And [4shall not turn away 1the 2rage 3of the lord] until whenever he should execute it, and until whenever he should establish it according to the enterprise of his heart. At the latter end of the days they shall comprehend them.

21. I did not send the false prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, and they prophesied.

22. And if they stood with my support, and they hearkened  to my words, then  my people would have turned from  [2wicked 3practices 1their].

23. [3a God 4being near 1I 2am], says the lord, and not a God at a distance.

24. Shall any be hid in secret, and I not see him, says the lord, no. Is it not that [3the 4heaven 5and 6the 7earth 1I 2shall fill], says the lord?

25. I heard what [3speak 1the 2prophets] who prophesy [2by  3my name 1lies], saying, I dreamed a dream.

26. For how long shall it be in the heart of the prophets  prophesying lies, and in  their prophesying the wants  of their heart?

27. The ones devising ways  to forget  my name by  their dreams, which [2was described 1each] to  his neighbor; as [2forgot  1their fathers]  my name in service to  Baal.

28. The prophet by which the dream is, let him describe  his dream! and the one by which  my word is truly with him, let him describe  my word in truth! What is the straw to the grain? Thus are  my words, says the lord.

29. Are not  my words as fire blazing, says the lord? and as a hewing axe beating the rock?

30. Behold, I am against the prophets, says the lord  God, the ones stealing  my words each from  his neighbor.

31. Behold, I am against the prophets, says the lord, the ones casting out prophecies of the tongue, and slumbering of their own slumber.

32. Behold, I am against the prophets  prophesying [2dreams 1false], and of whom described them, and misled  my people by  their lies, and in  their delusions; and I [3not 1sent 2them], and I did not give charge to them, and [3a benefit 2not 1they derived]  for this people, says the lord. 

33.  The Concern of The LORD And if [2should ask 3you  1this people], or priest, or prophet, saying, What is  the concern of the lord? then you shall say to them, You are the concern, and I will dash you down, says the lord,

34. and the prophet, and the priest, and the people, the ones who should say, The concern of the lord; even I will punish  that man, and  his house.

35. Thus you shall say each to  his neighbor, and each to  his brother, What did the lord answer? And what did the lord speak?

36. And the concern of the lord name not again! for the concern to the man will be  his word. And you distorted the words of the living God.

37. Thus you shall say to the prophet, What spoke the lord  our God?

38. On account of this, thus says the lord, Because you said  this word, The concern of the lord, that I sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The concern of the lord.

39. On account of this, behold, I will take and dash you down, and the city which I have given to you and to your fathers.

40. And I shall put upon you [2scorn 1eternal] and [2dishonor 1eternal], which shall not be forgotten.  

## Jeremiah 24

1.  Two Baskets of Figs [2showed 3to me 1The lord] two reed baskets of figs, being situated in front of the temple of the lord, after  [4resettled 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon]  Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the rulers, and the craftsmen, and the bondmen, from out of Jerusalem, and led them into Babylon.

2. The [2reed basket  1one] was of [3figs 2better 1exceedingly] as the [2figs  1early]; and the [2reed basket  1other] was of [3figs 2bad 1exceedingly] which shall not be eaten because of their badness.

3. And the lord said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs, the [2figs  1better 4better 3are exceedingly], and the bad ones [2bad 1exceedingly] which cannot be eaten because of their badness.

4. And came to pass the word of the lord to me saying,

5. Thus says the lord  God of Israel, As  [2figs  1these better], so shall I recognize the Jews being resettled whom I have sent out of  this place into the land of the Chaldeans for good.

6. And I shall firmly fix  my eyes upon them for good, and I shall restore them into  this land. And I will rebuild them, and in no way demolish; and I will plant them, and in no way will I pluck them up.

7. And I will give them a heart  for them to know me, that I am the lord. And they will be to me for a people, and I will be to them for God. For they shall turn towards me with [2entire 3heart 1their].

8. And as the [2figs  1bad] which shall not be eaten because of their badness, thus says the lord, So will I deliver up  Zedekiah king of Judah, and  his great men, and the rest of Jerusalem  being left behind in  this land, and the ones dwelling in Egypt.

9. And I will appoint them for being dispersed into all the kingdoms of the earth, and they will be for scorning, and for a parable, and for hatred, and for a curse in every place where I shall push them there.

10. And I will send against them the famine, and the plague, and the sword, until whenever they should fail from the land which I gave to them, and to their fathers.  

## Jeremiah 25

1.  The Captivity of Judah The word  coming to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the [2year  1fourth]  of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah; it was [2year 1the first]  to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;

2. which [4spoke 1Jeremiah 2the 3prophet] to all the people of Judah, and to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, saying,

3. In the thirteenth year of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah, and until  this day for twenty and three years, that [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, and I spoke to you rising early and speaking, and you listened not.

4. And I sent to you  my servants the prophets, [2them at dawn 1sending] (and you did not listen, and you did not take heed with your ears),

5. saying, Turn indeed each from  [3way 1his  2wicked], and from  [2wicked 3practices 1your]! and you shall dwell upon the land which I gave to you and to your fathers from the eon and unto the eon.

6. Go not after strange gods  to serve them! and  to do obeisance to them, so that you should not provoke me to anger by the works  of your hands so as for me to afflict you.

7. And you hearkened not to me.

8. On account of this, thus says the lord, Since you trusted not  my words,

9. behold, I send and I shall take the family of the north, and I will lead them upon  this land, and against the ones dwelling it, and against all the nations  round about it. And I will make them quite desolate. And I will appoint them for extinction, and for hissing, and for [2scorn 1everlasting].

10. And I will destroy from them the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom, and the voice of the bride, the scent of perfumed liquid, and the light of a lamp.

11. And [4will be 1all 2the 3land] for extinction, and [2shall serve  1these nations] to the king  of Babylon seventy years.

12. And in the fulfilling the seventy years, I will take vengeance upon the king of Babylon, and upon  that nation  of their unrighteousness, says the lord, and upon the land of the Caldeans. And I will appoint them for [2extinction 1everlasting].

13. And I will bring upon  that land all  my words which I spoke against it, all the things being written in  this scroll;

14. as many things as Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations, for they laid service against them when they were [2nations 1many] and [2kings 1great]. And I will recompense to them according to  their works,  according to the actions  of their hands. 

15.  The Cup of The LORD's Wrath Thus said the lord  God of Israel, Take the cup  [2wine  1of this undiluted] from out of my hand! and you shall give to drink all the nations to whom I send you unto them.

16. And they shall drink, and vomit forth, and shall be driven mad from in front of the sword of which I shall send in the midst of them.

17. And I took the cup from out of the hand of the lord, and I gave to drink all the nations to whom [3sent 4me 1the 2 lord] unto them;

18.  Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the king of Judah, and his rulers --  to appoint them for desolation, and for an untrodden land, and for a hissing, and for a curse as  this day;

19. even  Pharaoh king of Egypt, and  his children, and  his great men, and all  his people,

20. and all  his consolidations, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and  Ashkelon, and  Gaza, and  Ekron, and the remaining of Ashdod,

21. and  Edom, and  Moab, and the sons of Ammon,

22. and all the kings of Tyre, and the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the ones on the other side of the sea,

23. and  Dedan and Tema, and Buz, and all being shaven around his face,

24. and all the kings  of Arabia, and all the consolidations of the ones resting up in the wilderness,

25. and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,

26. and all the kings from the east wind, the ones at a distance, and of the ones near, each with  his brother, and all the kingdoms, the ones upon the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach shall drink with them.

27. And you shall say to them, thus said the lord almighty, Drink, be intoxicated, and vomit forth, and fall, and in no way rise up from in front of the sword! of which I send in the midst of you.

28. And it will be whenever they should not want to take the cup from out of  your hand so as to drink, then you shall say, Thus said the lord of the forces, By drinking you shall drink.

29. For in the city upon which [2is named  1my name] by it, I begin to afflict. And you by cleansing in no way shall be cleansed, for [3a sword 1I 2shall call] upon all the ones settling down upon the earth, says the lord of the forces.

30. And you shall prophesy against them all  these words, and shall say, The lord from on high shall execute from  [2place  1his holy] he shall give his voice; [2a word 1he will execute] against  his place; and thus as ones gathering vintage shall be answered, and against the ones settling upon the earth shall come ruin,

31. upon a part of the earth. For judgment is by the lord among the nations; he himself pleads to all flesh; but the impious shall be given to the sword, says the lord.

32. Thus said the lord of the forces, Behold, evils come from nation upon nation, and [2tempest 1a great] goes forth from end of the earth.

33. And there will be slain by the lord in that day from a part of the earth, even unto into a part of the earth; in no way shall they be lamented, and in no way shall they be gathered, and in no way shall they be buried, for [2dung 3upon 4the face 5of the 6earth 1they will be].

34. Shout, O shepherds, and cry out! And beat the chest, O rams of the flocks! For [2were filled  1your days] for slaughter, and you shall fall as the [2rams  1choice].

35. And [2shall perish 1flight] from the shepherds, and safety shall flee from the rams of the flocks.

36. A sound of a cry of the shepherds, and a shout of the rams, for the lord annihilated  their pastures.

37. And [4shall cease 1the 2rest places  3of peace] from the face of the anger of the rage of the lord.

38. He abandoned [2as 3a lion 1his lodging], for [2became  1their land] an untrodden place from in front of the [2sword  1great].  

## Jeremiah 26

1.  Jeremiah Speaks in the Courtyard In the beginning of the reign of king Jehoiakim son of Josiah came  this word from the lord.

2. Thus said the lord, Stand in the courtyard of the house of the lord! and you shall execute an order to all Judah, to the ones coming to do obeisance in the house of the lord, all the words which I ordered to you to execute to them; you should not remove a thing.

3. Perhaps they shall hear, and shall be turned each from  [3way 1his  2evil], and I will cease from the bad things which I devise  to do to them because of  [2evil 3practices 1their].

4. And you shall say, Thus said the lord, If you should not hearken to me  to go by  my laws which I put before your face,

5. to listen to the words  of my servants the prophets whom I sent to you at dawn, (for I sent, and you hearkened not to me;)

6. then I will appoint  this house as Shiloh, and  this city I will appoint for a curse to all the nations of the earth.

7. And they heard (the priests, and the false prophets, and all the people)  Jeremiah speaking  these words in the house of the lord. 

8.  Jeremiah Seized And it came to pass of Jeremiah ceasing speaking all which the lord ordered to him to say to all the people, that they seized him -- the priests, and the false prophets, and all the people, saying, To death he shall die,

9. for you prophesied in the name of the lord, saying, [3as 4Shiloh 2will be  1This house], and  this city shall be made desolate of ones dwelling it. And [4held an assembly 1all 2the 3people] against Jeremiah in the house of the lord.

10. And [4heard 1the 2rulers 3of Judah]  these words, and they ascended from the house of the king unto the house of the lord; and they sat in the thresholds [3gate 4of the lord 1of the 2new].

11. And [6said 1the 2priests 3and 4the 5false prophets] to the rulers, and to all the people, The judgment of death belongs  to this man, for he prophesied against  this city, as you heard with  your ears.

12. And Jeremiah said to all the rulers, and to all the people, saying, The lord sent me to prophesy against  this house and against  this city all the words which you heard.

13. And now, [3better 1you make  2your ways], and  your works, and hearken to the voice of the lord  your God! and the lord will cease from the evils which he spoke against you.

14. And behold, I am in your hands; do to me as is advantageous to you, and as best for you!

15. But only in knowing know! that if you do away with me, [4blood 3innocent 1you 2have imputed] against you, and against  this city, and against the ones dwelling in it. For in truth [2has sent 3me 1the lord] to you to speak into  your ears all  these words.

16. And [7said 1the 2rulers 3and 4all 5the 6people] to the priests and to the false prophets; There is not due to this man a judgment of death, for upon the name of the lord  our God he spoke to us.

17. And there rose up men of the elders of the land, and they said to all the gathering  of people, saying,

18. Micah the Morasthite was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the lord of the forces; Zion [2as 3a field 1shall be plowed], and Jerusalem [2for 3a storehouse of fruits 1will be], and the mountain of the house shall be turned into a sacred grove.

19. Did, by doing away, [7do away with 8him 1Hezekiah 2king 3of Judah 4and 5all 6Judah]? Was it not they feared  the lord, and they beseeched  in front of the lord, and the lord ceased from the evils which he spoke against them? And we did [2evils 1great] against our souls.

20. And there was another man prophesying in the name of the lord, Urijah son of Shemaiah from Kirjath-jearim; and he prophesied concerning  this city, and concerning  this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.

21. And [7heard  1king 2Jehoiakim 3and 4all 5the 6rulers] all  his words, and sought to kill him. And Urijah heard and feared and fled and entered into Egypt.

22. And [3sent 1the 2king] men into Egypt, Elnathan son of Achbor, and men with him into  Egypt.

23. And they led him from there, and brought him to the king; and he struck him by the sword, and tossed him into the tomb of the sons of his people.

24. Only the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so as to not deliver him into the hands of the people so as to not do away with him.  

## Jeremiah 27

1.  Bonds and Collars In the beginning of the kingdom of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah came to pass  this word to Jeremiah from the lord, saying,

2. Thus said the lord, Make to yourself bonds and collars, and put them around  your neck!

3. And you shall send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the sons of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hands of their messengers, of the ones coming in Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.

4. And you shall order them [2to  3their lords 1to say], Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel; Thus you shall say to  your lords,

5. I made the earth, and the men, and the cattle, the ones upon the face of the earth, by  [3strength 1my  2great] and by  [3arm 1my  2high], and I shall give it to whom ever it seems fit in my eyes.

6. And now I gave all the earth to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to serve to him, and the wild beasts of the field to work for him.

7. And to his son, and to the son  of his son, unto the coming time  of his land, and also of him. And [3shall serve 4to him 2nations 1many], and [2kings 1great].

8. And the nation, and the kingdom, as many as should not serve Nebuchadnezzar king  of Babylon, and as many as should not put  their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, by the sword, and by pestilence, and by famine I shall visit them, said the lord, until they should falter by his hand.

9. And you, hearken not to  your false prophets! and of the ones using oracles for you, and of the ones dreaming to you, and of the ones of your omens, and of the ones of your administers of potions, saying, In no way should you work for the king of Babylon.

10. For [3a lie 1they 2prophesy] to you, to  distance you from  your land, and that I should cast you out, and you shall perish.

11. And the nation which ever should bring  its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and should work for him, I will leave it upon  its land, says the lord, and it shall work her, and it will dwell in her.

12. And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke according to all  these words, saying, Bring  your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,

13. and work for him and for his people! and you shall live. Why should you die and  your people by sword, and by famine, and by pestilence, as the lord spoke against nations, which served not to the king of Babylon?

14. You should not hearken to the words of the prophets saying to you, You should not serve to the king of Babylon; for unjustly they prophesy to you.

15. I did not send them, says the lord, and they prophesy in my name  unjustly for the destroying you. And you shall perish, and  your prophets, the ones prophesying to you by an unjust lie.

16. And to the priests and to all  this people I spoke, saying, Thus said the lord, Do not hearken to the words of the prophets  prophesying to you! saying, Behold, the items of the house of the lord shall return from out of Babylon now quickly. For [3unjustly 1they 2prophesy] to you.

17. Do not hearken to them, but you serve to the king  of Babylon! and you should live. Why shall it be to her, to the city for desolation?

18. If they are prophets, and if [3is 1the word 2of the lord] in them, let them meet me, that they should not carry in the vessels, the ones being left behind in the house of the lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, into Babylon.

19. For thus said the lord concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and for the remaining items, the ones being left behind in  this city,

20. which [3did not 4take 1the king 2of Babylon] when he resettled  Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from out of Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem.

21. For thus says the lord  of the forces, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels  being left behind in the house of the lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and Jerusalem.

22. [2into 3Babylon 1They shall enter], and there they shall be until the day  of their visitation, and I will lead them and I will return them into  this place.  

## Jeremiah 28

1.  Hananiah the Prophet And it came to pass in the fourth year of the reigning of Zedekiah king of Judah, in [3month 1the 2fifth], [2said 3to me 1Hananiah] (son of Azur the false prophet, the one from Gibeon) in the house of the lord in front of the eyes of the priests and all the people, saying,

2. Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, I broke the yoke of the king of Babylon.

3. Yet in two years of days I will return unto  this place all the items of the house of the lord,

4. and Jeconiah, and the resettlement of Judah; for I shall break the yoke of the king of Babylon.

5. And [4said 1Jeremiah 2the 3prophet] to Hananiah before the eyes of the priests, and before the eyes of all of the people  standing in the house of the lord;

6. and Jeremiah said, Truly, thus may the lord do, the lord establish  your word which you prophesy  to return the items of the house of the lord, and all the resettlement from out of Babylon to  this place.

7. Only hear  this word which I say into  your ears, and into the ears of all the people.

8. The prophets, the ones being prior to me, and prior to you from the eon, and prophesied against [2land 1much], and over [2kingdoms 1great] concerning war, and concerning affliction, and concerning pestilence.

9. The prophet  prophesying for peace, in the coming to pass of the word, they shall know the prophet whom [2sent 3to them 1the lord] in trust.

10. And Hananiah took the collars from the neck of Jeremiah, and he broke them.

11. And Hananiah said before the eyes of all the people, saying, Thus said the lord, Thus I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon in two years of days from the necks of all the nations. And Jeremiah set out unto  his way.

12. And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah after  Hananiah broke the collars from  his neck, saying,

13. Proceed and say to Hananiah! saying, Thus said the lord, [3collars 2wooden 1you broke], but I will make instead of these collars of iron.

14. For thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, A yoke of iron I have put upon  the neck of all the nations to work for the king of Babylon,  to serve to him. And indeed the cattle of the land I gave to him.

15. And Jeremiah said  to Hananiah, Hear, O Hananiah! [2has not sent 3you 1The lord], and you [3to rely 1made  2this people] upon wrongdoing.

16. On account of this, Thus said the lord, Behold, I send you out from the face of the land. In this  year you shall die, for [2against 3the 4 lord 1you spoke].

17. And he died in the [2month  1seventh].  

## Jeremiah 29

1.  Jeremiah's Letter to the Captives And these are the words of the book which [3sent 1Jeremiah 2the prophet] from Jerusalem to the elders of the resettlement, and to the priests, and to the false prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar resettled from Jerusalem unto Babylon,

2. (after the coming forth of Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, and every free man, and bondman, and craftsman from out of Jerusalem;)

3. by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom [4sent 1Zedekiah 2king 3of Judah] to the king of Babylon into Babylon, saying,

4. Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, unto the resettlement which he resettled from Jerusalem to Babylon;

5. Build houses, and dwell, and plant gardens, and eat  of their fruits!

6. And take wives, and produce children, sons and daughters! And take for your sons wives, and for your daughters give husbands! and they shall bear sons and daughters, and they shall be multiplied, and shall not be diminished.

7. And seek for peace of the land into which I resettled you there! And pray for them to the lord! for in  their peace there will be peace to you.

8. For thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Let not dissuade you the false prophets  among you! And let not dissuade you  your clairvoyants! And hearken not to  your dreams which you dream!

9. For by wrongdoing they prophesy to you in  my name, and [3not 1I sent 2them], says the lord.

10. For thus said the lord, Whenever [3is about 4to be filled 5in 6Babylon 1seventy 2years], I will visit you, and I will set  my words upon you,  to return  your people unto  this place.

11. And I will devise for you a device of peace, and not evils,  to give to you these things.

12. And pray to me! and I will hearken to you.

13. And seek after me! and you shall find me. For whenever you should seek after me with [2entire 3heart 1your],

14. then I shall appear unto you.

15. For you said, [2placed 4to us 1The lord 3prophets] in Babylon.

16. Thus says the lord to the king, the one sitting upon the throne of David, and to all the people, the one dwelling in  this city,  to  your brethren, the ones not going forth with you into captivity.

17. Thus says the lord of the forces, Behold, I shall send to them a sword, and famine, and pestilence. And I shall establish them as [2fig 1a bad] which one shall not [2to eat 1be able] because of the badness.

18. And I shall pursue them with a sword, and famine, and pestilence. And I shall give them for movement in all the kingdoms of the earth, and for a curse, and for perplexity, and for a hissing, and for scorning to all the nations to whom I cast them.

19. For they hearkened not to  my words, says the lord, which I sent to them through  my servants the prophets, rising early and sending; and they hearkened not, says the lord.

20. You then hearken to the words of the lord! even all the displacement which I sent from Jerusalem into Babylon.

21. Thus said the lord against Ahab son of Kolaiah, and against Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, the ones prophesying to you [2in 3my name 1lies]. Behold, I give them into the hands of the king of Babylon. And he shall strike them before your eyes.

22. And they shall take from them a curse in all the resettlement of Judah in Babylon, saying, Let [2do 3to you 1the lord] as [2to Zedekiah 1he did], and as Ahab! whom [3fried 1the king 2of Babylon] in fire.

23. Because of [2which 3they did 1the lawlessness] in Jerusalem, and they committed adultery with the women  of their fellow-countrymen, and [2a word 1they executed] by  my name which I did not order to them; and I am witness, says the lord.

24. And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say,

25. I did not send you  in my name. And to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest he said,

26. The lord appointed you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to become supervisor in the house of the lord to every man prophesying, and to every man being maniacal, and you shall put him in the prison, and in the dungeon.

27. And now, why did you not join in reviling Jeremiah, the one from Anathoth, the one prophesying to you?

28. For on account of this, he sent to us in Babylon, saying, Freedom is far off -- build houses, and inhabit them, and plant gardens, and eat  their fruit!

29. And Zephaniah read the scroll into the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.

30. And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah, saying,

31. Send to all the resettlement, saying, Thus said the lord against Shemaiah the Nehelamite, Since [2prophesied 3to you 1Shemaiah], and I did not send him, and [3rely 1he made 2you] upon wrongdoing;

32. on account of this, thus said the lord, Behold, I shall visit against Shemaiah, and against  his kind; and there will not be to him a man in the midst of you  to behold the good things which I shall do to you, says the lord; for [2defection 1he spoke] against the lord.  

## Jeremiah 30

1.  The Return of Israel The word  coming to Jeremiah from the lord, saying,

2. Thus said the lord  God of Israel, saying, Write all the words which I executed to you upon a scroll!

3. For behold, days come, says the lord, and I will return the resettlement of my people Israel and Judah, said the lord. And I will return them into the land which I gave to their fathers, and they will dominate it.

4. And these are the words which the lord spoke unto Israel and Judah.

5. Thus said the lord, The sound of fear you shall hear -- fear, and there is no peace.

6. Ask and see if [2gave birth 1a man]! for I have seen every man, and  his hands are upon  his loin, as her giving birth; and [2are turned 1their faces] to jaundice.

7. Woe, for great is  that day, and there is not such, and [2a time 3of severity 1it is] to Jacob, but from this he shall be delivered.

8. In  that day, said the lord of the forces, I will break the yoke from  their neck, and  their bonds I will tear up, and they shall not work themselves any longer for strangers.

9. And they shall work to the lord their God; and  [2David 3their king 1I will raise up] to them.

10. But you, do not fear! O my servant Jacob, says the lord. And in no way should you be terrified, O Israel. For behold, I shall deliver you from a land far off, and  your seed from a land  of their captivity. And Jacob shall be returned, and he shall rest, and he shall abound in all the good things, and there shall not be  one fearing.

11. For [2with 3you 1I am], says the lord,  to deliver you. For I shall appoint a consumation in all the nations in which I scattered you, but you in no way will I appoint for consumation. But I shall correct you with equity and cleansing of which I shall cleanse you.

12. Thus said the lord, I raised up destruction; [2is painful  1your calamity];

13. there is not one judging your case; [2for 3a painful state 1you were treated medically]; [2benefit 3to you 1there is no];

14. all  your friends forgot you; in no way shall they ask, for [3with a beating 4by the enemy 1I smote 2you], [2discipline 1even substantial]; [3over 4all 5your iniquities 2multiplied  1your sins].

15. Why yell over your destruction? [2is incurable  1Your misery]. On account of the magnitude  of your iniquity, and on account of  [3sins 1your  2recalcitrant] I did to you these things.

16. On account of this all the ones devouring you shall be eaten, and all  your enemies [2into 3captivity 1shall come]. And [4will be 1the ones 2dispersing 3you] for dispersion, and all the ones having despoiled you I shall give for plunder.

17. For I will lead up  your cure, [2from 4wound 3a grievous 1I will treat you]; says the lord, for [2Her Having Been Sown 1you are called]; Zion, for [3seeking 2no 1there is] her. 

18.  The Resettlement of Jacob Thus said the lord; Behold, I shall return the resettlement of Jacob, and  his captivity I will show mercy, and [2shall be built 1the city] upon  her height, and the people [2according to  3his equity 1shall sit].

19. And there shall come forth from them ones singing, and a sound of ones playing. And I shall make them superabundant, and in no way shall they be made less.

20. And [2shall enter  1his sons] as  formerly, and  their testimonies are in front of me straight up. And I shall visit upon all the ones afflicting them.

21. And [2will be 1his stronger ones] over them, and  his ruler [2from 3him 1shall come forth]. And I will bring them together, and they shall return to me. For who is this who gave  his heart to return to me, says the lord?

22. And you shall be to me for a people, and I shall be to you for Lord.

23. For the anger of the lord went forth; rage went forth; [2anger 1turning 4upon 5the impious 3shall come].

24. In no way shall [4turn 1the anger 2of the rage 3of the lord] until he should execute, and until he should ordain the enterprise of his heart. Upon the last of the days you shall know them.  

## Jeremiah 31

1.  The Remnant of Israel Is Delivered In  that time, said the lord, I will be for a God to the race of Israel, and they will be to me for a people.

2. Thus said the lord, They found it hot in the wilderness with ones being destroyed by sword. Proceed! and you should not destroy  Israel.

3. The lord [2at a distance 1shall be seen] by him, saying, [2affection 1With an everlasting] I loved you; on account of this I drew you for pitying.

4. For I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin Israel. You shall still take your tambourine, and go forth with a congregation playing.

5. For you planted vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. In planting plant! and in praising praise!

6. For it is the day of calling, of ones pleading on the mountains of Ephraim, saying, Rise up, and ascend in Zion to the lord  your God!

7. For thus said the lord  to Jacob, Be glad and snort over the head of nations! [2audibly 1Do it], and praise! Say! The lord delivered  his people, the remnant of Israel.

8. Behold, I lead them from the north, and I will gather them from the ends of the earth, in a holiday passover. And you shall produce children, [2multitude 1a great], and they shall return here.

9. In weeping they went forth, and in comfort I will lead them. Lodging upon aqueducts of waters in [2way 1the straight], and in no way shall they wander in it. For I became  to Israel for a father, and Ephraim [2my first-born 1is].

10. Hear the words of the lord, O nations, and announce unto islands  far off! Say! The one winnowing  Israel will gather him, and he shall guard him as the one grazing his flock.

11. For the lord ransomed  Jacob and rescued him from out of the hand of ones more substantial than he.

12. And they shall come and shall be glad in  mount Zion. And they shall come upon the good things of the lord, upon a land of grain, and wine, and olive oil, and fruits, and cattle, and sheep. And [2shall be  1their soul] as the tree containing fruit. And they shall not hunger any longer.

13. Then [2shall rejoice 1virgins] in a gathering of young men; and old men shall rejoice. And I will turn  their mourning into joyfulness, and I will comfort them, and I will make them ones being glad.

14. I will magnify and intoxicate the soul of the priests, sons of Levi. And  my people  [2of my good things 1shall be filled up]. Thus said the lord. 

15.  Rachel Weeping for Her Sons A voice in Rama was heard -- wailing, and weeping, and grieving; Rachel weeping  for her sons; and she did not want to be comforted, for they are not.

16. Thus said the lord, Stop  your voice from weeping, and  your eyes from tears, for there is a wage  for your works, says the lord, and they shall return from out of the land of the enemies;

17. And there shall be hope to the last of you, says the lord. And [3shall return 1the 2sons] to  their borders.

18. In hearing I heard Ephraim grieving, saying, You corrected me, and I was corrected. I, as a calf, was not taught. Turn me! and I will turn. For you are the lord  my God.

19. For after my captivity, I changed my mind; and after  my knowing, I moaned over the day of shame. And I showed you plainly that I took scorning of my youth.

20. [3son 2a beloved 1Ephraim is] to me, a child for reveling in, for because  my words are in him; in remembering I will remember him; on account of this I hastened unto him; by showing mercy I shall show mercy on him, says the lord.

21. Establish to yourself overseers! Execute punishment! Give your heart to  your shoulders in the way in which you were going! Return, O virgin Israel! Return unto  your cities mourning!

22. Until when shall you return, O daughter being disgraced? For the lord created safety for [2planting 1a new]; in your safety [2shall go about 1men]. 

23.  The Future Prosperity of Judah Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Still they shall say  this word in the land of Judah, and in his cities, whenever I shall return  his resettlement; Being blessed is the lord upon [2just 3mountain  1his holy];

24. even the ones dwelling in the cities of Judah, and in all  his land together with the farmer, and he shall be lifted with the flock.

25. For I intoxicated the soul thirsting; and every soul hungering I filled up.

26. On account of this I awoke, and beheld; and  my sleep [2agreeable 3to me 1was].

27. Behold, days come, says the lord, and I shall sow  Israel and  Judah with the seed of man, and the seed of beast.

28. And it will be as I was vigilant over them even to demolish and to inflict evil, so I will be vigilant over them  to build and to plant, says the lord.

29. In  those days in no way shall they say, The fathers ate an unripe grape, and  teeth of the children had tooth-chills.

30. But each in  his own sin shall die. And the one eating the unripe grape, [3shall have tooth-chills 1their 2teeth]. 

31.  God Ordains a New Covenant Behold, days come, says the lord, and I shall ordain to the house of Israel, and to the house of Judah, [2covenant 1a new].

32. Not according to the covenant which I ordained with their fathers, in the day in which I took hold of  their hand to lead them from out of the land of Egypt; for they did not adhere to  my covenant, and I neglected them, says the lord.

33. For this  is my covenant which I shall ordain with the house of Israel after  those days, says the lord; I will put my laws into  their mind, and [3upon 4their hearts 1I will write 2them]; and I will be to them for God, and they will be to me for a people.

34. And in no way shall [2teach 1each]  his neighbor, and each  his brother, saying, Know the lord! For all shall know me, from their small unto their great, says the lord. For I will be kind to their iniquities, and  their sins in no way shall I remember any more.

35. Thus said the lord, the one appointing the sun for light of the day, moon and stars for light of the night, and the roar in the sea, and [2resonated  1its waves]; the lord almighty is his name.

36. If [3should cease  2laws 1these] from in front of me, says the lord, then the race of Israel shall cease to become a nation in front of me all the days.

37. Thus says the lord, If [3should be raised up 1the 2heaven] in  elevation, and if [5should be lowered 1the 2floor 3of the 4earth] below, yet I shall not reject the race of Israel, says the lord, for all which they did.

38. Behold, days come, says the lord, and [2shall be built 1a city] to the lord from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.

39. And [2shall go forth  1its measurement] before it unto the hills of Gareb; and it shall be surrounded round about of choice stones,

40. and all the valley Phagarim and ashes, and all Asaremoth unto the rushing stream Kidron, unto the corner gate of the horses eastward, shall be a sanctuary to the lord; and no longer shall it be plucked up, and in no way shall it be demolished unto the eon.  

## Jeremiah 32

1.  Jeremiah Acquires a Field The word  having come from the lord to Jeremiah in the [2year  1tenth] of Zedekiah king of Judah -- this is [2year 1the eighteenth] of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

2. And the force of the king of Babylon built a palisade against Jerusalem. And Jeremiah was being guarded in the courtyard of the guard, which is in the house of the king of Judah.

3. By which [3imprisoned 4him  1king 2Zedekiah], saying, Why do you prophesy, saying, Thus said the lord, Behold, I give  this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;

4. and Zedekiah in no way shall escape from out of the hand of the Chaldeans, for by being delivered up he shall be delivered up into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with his mouth to his mouth, and  his eyes  [2his eyes 1shall see].

5. And Zedekiah shall enter into Babylon, and there he shall stay until of which time I should look upon him, says the lord. But if you should wage war against the Chaldeans you shall not be prosperous.

6. And Jeremiah spoke. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Jeremiah, saying,

7. Behold, Hanameel son of Shallum brother of your father comes to you, saying, Acquire to yourself  my field, the one in Anathoth! for [2to you 1it is equitable] to take it for a possession.

8. And [6came 7to 8me 1Hanameel 2the son 3of Shallum 4the brother 5of my father] according to the word of the lord in the courtyard of the guard. And he said to me, Acquire to yourself  my field! the one in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin; for [2to you 1it is equitable] to acquire, for you are older. And I knew that [2the word 3of the lord 1it was].

9. And I acquired the field from Hanameel the son of the brother of my father, the field in Anathoth. And I set for him seven [4shekels 1and 2ten 3silver]. 

10.  The Scroll of the Possession And I wrote in a scroll, and set a seal upon it, and took the testimony of witnesses, and set the silver in a yoke balance scale.

11. And I took the scroll of the possession  being read and having the seal set upon,

12. and I gave it  to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel son of the brother of my father, and before the eyes of the ones standing witnessing and writing in the scroll of the possession, and according to the eyes of all the Jews  sitting down in the courtyard of the guard.

13. And I ordered  Baruch in front of their eyes, saying,

14. Thus said the lord almighty, the God of Israel, Take the scroll  of this possession! even this scroll  being sealed and being read. And you shall put it into [2receptacle 1an earthenware], that it should remain [2days 1many more].

15. For thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Still there shall be created fields, and houses, and vineyards in  this land. 

16.  Jeremiah Prays And I prayed to the lord after  my giving the scroll of the possession to Baruch son of Neriah, saying,

17. O Being One, O lord God, you made the heaven and the earth  [3strength 1by your  2great], and  [5arm 1by your  2high 3and  4elevated]; in no way shall [2be concealed 3from 4you 1anything];

18. the one having mercy unto thousands, and recompensing sins of fathers into the bosom of their children after them.  [5God 1The 2great 3and 4strong]; the lord of the forces, is his name,

19. of great counsel, and mighty  in works.  Your eyes are opened upon all the ways of the sons  of men, to give each according to  his way, and according to the fruit  of his practices.

20. The one who did signs and miracles in the land of Egypt unto  this day, and in Israel, and among the earth-born; and you made for yourself a name, as  this day.

21. And you led  your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with miracles, by [2hand 1a fortified], and by [2arm 1a high], and by [2visions 1great].

22. And you gave to them  this land which you swore by an oath to their fathers; a land flowing milk and honey.

23. And they entered and took it. And they hearkened not to  your voice, and [2by  3your orders 1they did not go]. All which you charged to them, they did not do. And they caused [3to come to pass 4to them 1all  2these bad things].

24. Behold, a multitude is come unto the city to seize it, and the city was given into the hands of Chaldeans  waging war against it, by the face of the sword, and famine, and pestilence. As you said so it happened; and behold, you see.

25. And you say to me, Acquire to yourself the field with silver, and take testimony of witnesses! And the city was given into the hands of Chaldeans. 

26.  Assurance from The LORD And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

27. I am the lord  God of all flesh. Shall [3from 4me 2be hidden 1anything]?

28. On account of this, thus said the lord; In granting, [2shall be delivered up  1this city] into the hands of Chaldeans, and into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.

29. And [3shall come 1the 2Chaldeans] waging war against  this city; and they shall burn  this city by fire, and shall incinerate the houses in which they burned incense upon  their roofs  to Baal, and offered libations to other gods, to  greatly embitter me.

30. For [8were 1the 2sons 3of Israel 4and 5the 6sons 7of Judah] alone doing the wicked thing in front of my eyes from their youth. The sons of Israel were the ones greatly embittering me in the works  of their hands, says the lord.

31. For [3for 4my anger 5and 6for 7my rage 2was  1this city] from which day they built it, and unto  this day, to rid it from my face;

32. because of all the wickedness of the sons of Israel and Judah, which they did to embitter me, they, and  their kings, and  their rulers, and  their priests, and  their prophets, the men of Judah, and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem.

33. And they turned [2to 3me 1their back], and not their face. And I taught them at dawn, and they hearkened not to take instruction.

34. And they put  their defilements in the house which [2was called  1my name] upon by them in their uncleannesses.

35. And they built the shrines to Baal, the ones in the ravine of the son of Hinnom,  to offer  their sons and  their daughters to Molech; which I ordered not to them, and it ascended not unto my heart  to do  this abomination, to  seduce Judah to sin. 

36.  The LORD Ordains an Everlasting Covenant And now, thus said the lord  God of Israel against  this city, which you say, It shall be delivered up into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence.

37. Behold, I will gather them from out of all the land of which I scattered them there in my anger, and in  my rage, and [2fit of temper 1a great]. And I will return them unto  this place; and I will settle them having secured them.

38. And they will be to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.

39. And I will give to them [2way 1another] and [2heart 1another], to fear me all the days, and for good to them and  their children after them.

40. And I will ordain with them [2covenant 1an everlasting] which in no way shall I turn behind them. And  [2my fear 1I will put] in  their heart, to  not separate them from me.

41. And I will visit them  to do good to them. And I will plant them in  this land in trust, even with all my heart, and with all my soul.

42. For thus said the lord, As I brought upon  this people all  [3bad things  2great 1these], so I will bring upon them all the good things which I spoke unto them.

43. And there shall be acquired still fields in the land, in which you say, It is untrodden of men and beast; and they were delivered up into the hands of Chaldeans.

44. And they shall acquire fields with silver; and you shall write in a scroll, and shall set a seal upon it, and shall take testimony of witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and round about  Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the Sephela, and in the cities of the Negev. For I shall return  their resettlement, says the lord.  

## Jeremiah 33

1.  Promise of Restoration And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah a second time, (and he was still bound in the courtyard of the guard,) saying,

2. Thus said the lord, the one making the earth and shaping it,  to re-erect it; the lord is his name.

3. Cry out to me! and I will answer you, and I will report to you great and mighty things which [3not 1you knew 2them].

4. For thus said the lord  God of Israel, concerning the houses  of this city, and concerning the houses of the king of Judah  being demolished for a siege mound and battlements,

5.  to do combat against the Chaldeans, and to fill it of the dead, of the men whom I struck in my anger, and in my rage, and turned  my face from  this city on account of all  their wickednesses.

6. Behold, I lead to her a closing of her wound and a cure. And I will treat them, and I will make manifest to them to hear, and I will make to them peace and trust. 

7.  Return of the Resettlement And I will return the resettlement of Judah and the resettlement of Israel; and I will build them as  prior.

8. And I will cleanse them from all  their iniquities which they sinned against me. And in no way shall I remember their sins which they sinned against me, and separated from me.

9. And it will be to me for a name for gladness, and for praise, and for magnificence to all the people of the earth, who shall hear all the good things which I do for them. And they shall fear and shall be pricked on account of all the good things, and on account of all the peace which I make for them.

10. Thus said the lord, There shall still be heard in  this place (in which you say, It is desolate of men and animals, in the cities of Judah, and outside Jerusalem in the places having been made desolate by the not being a man and beast,)

11. a voice of gladness, and a voice of joyfulness, a voice of a groom, and a voice of a bride, a voice of men saying, Make acknowledgment to the lord almighty! for the lord is gracious, for into the eon  is his mercy. And they shall carry in gifts to the house of the lord. For I shall return all the resettlement  of that land as  prior, said the lord.

12. Thus said the lord of the forces, There shall yet be in  [2place  1this desolate] (by reason of  not being a man and cattle in all  of its cities) a lodging for shepherds bedding flocks.

13. In the cities of the mountainous area, and in the cities of the Sephela, and in the cities of the Negev, and in the land of Benjamin. And in the places round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah yet shall go sheep by the hand of one counting, said the lord.

14. Behold days come, says the lord, and I will raise up the [2word  1good] which I spoke over the house of Israel and over the house of Judah.

15. In those  days and in  that time, [2to sprout 1I will cause] to David a bud of righteousness. And [2shall reign 1a king], and he shall be perceiving, and shall cause equity and righteousness in the land.

16. In  those days Judah shall be delivered, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely. And this is the name  they shall call him, The lord our Justice.

17. For thus says the lord, It shall not be deficient to David for a man sitting upon the throne of Israel.

18. And from the priests and Levites it shall not be deficient for a man to be before me offering whole burnt-offerings, and an incense gift, and doing a sacrifice all the days.

19. And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah, saying,

20. Thus says the lord, If [3as being annuled 1you should make  2my covenant], the covenant with the day and  my covenant  with the night, so as for there to not be a day and a night in  their time,

21. then  my covenant being annuled will be with  David  my servant, so as to not be of him a son reigning upon  his throne nor with the Levites and priests  of my ministration.

22. As if [4shall not be counted 1the 2military  3of heaven], and [5shall not be measured 1the 2sand 3of the 4sea], thus I shall multiply the seed  of David  my firebrand, and of the Levites  of my ministration.

23. And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah, saying,

24. Do you not know what  this people spoke, saying, Two kin which [3chose 1the 2 lord], he pushed them out? And  [2my people 1they provoked] that you should not be a nation before them.

25. Thus says the lord, If [2may not 3be  1my covenant] to the day and to the night, and laws of the heaven and of the earth, then I ordained not.

26. Thus the seed of Jacob and David  my servant I would have banished, so as [2to not 3receive 1for me] of  his seed rulers among the seed of Abraham, and  of Isaac, and  of Jacob. For I shall return  their captivity, and I shall show mercy on them.  

## Jeremiah 34

1.  Warning to Zedekiah The word  coming to Jeremiah from the lord when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all  his encamped army, and to all the kingdoms of the earth, to the ones under the dominion  of his hand, all the peoples waged war against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah, saying,

2. Thus said the lord, the God of Israel, Proceed to Zedekiah king of Judah! and you shall say to him, Thus said the lord, In delivering up, I shall deliver up  this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall seize it, and shall burn it with fire.

3. And you in no way shall be delivered from out of his hand; and by seizure you shall be seized, and into his hands you shall be given; and  your eyes  [2his eyes 1shall see] and  his mouth [2with  3your mouth 1shall speak], and into Babylon you shall enter.

4. But hear the word of the lord, Zedekiah, O king of Judah! Thus says the lord to you, you shall not die by the broadsword.

5. In peace you shall die, and as they burned odors  for your fathers  reigning prior of you, so they shall burn also for you, saying, O Lord. And they shall lament you, for [3the word 1I 2spoke], said the lord.

6. And Jeremiah spoke to  king Zedekiah all  these words in Jerusalem.

7. And the force of the king of Babylon waged war against Jerusalem, and against the cities of Judah, the ones remaining, and against Lachish, and against Azekah, for these were left among the cities of Judah -- [2cities 1fortified]. 

8.  Freedom for Hebrew Slaves The word  coming to Jeremiah by the lord, after the completing by king Zedekiah the covenant with the people, the one in Jerusalem,  to call indeed for a release;

9.  [2to send out 1for each]  his manservant, and each  his maidservant, the Hebrew man and the Hebrew woman free, so that  no [4should slave 1man 2from 3Judah].

10. And [4heeded 1all 2the 3great men], and all the people, the ones entering into the covenant  to send each  his manservant and each  his maidservant free, to not serve any more to them. And they heeded, and let them go.

11. And they were turned after these things, and they led the bondmen and the maidservants whom they sent free, and they subjected them again as manservants and maidservants.

12. And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah, saying,

13. Thus said the lord  God of Israel, I ordained a covenant with  your fathers in the day in which I rescued them from out of the land of Egypt, from out of the house of slavery, saying,

14. Whenever [3should be fulfilled 1six 2years], you shall send free  [3brother 1your  2Hebrew], who shall be sold to you; and he shall work for you six years, and then you shall send him out free. And they did not hear me, and did not lean  their ear.

15. And they turned today to do the right thing before my eyes,  [2to call 3for a release 1for each]  for his neighbor; and they completed a covenant in front of me, in the house of which [3is called  2name 1my] upon in it.

16. And you turned and profaned  my covenant,  to return each  his manservant, and each  his maidservant, whom you sent out as ones free  in their soul, and you subjected them again  to be to you for manservants and maidservants.

17. On account of this, thus said the lord, You hearkened not to me  to call a release -- each for  his brother, and each for  his neighbor. Behold, I call a release to you -- to the sword, and to the plague, and to the famine; and I will give you for dispersion unto all the kingdoms of the earth.

18. And I will give the men, the ones passing  my covenant, the ones not establishing  my covenant, which they made in front of me, the calf which they cut in two parts, and I went through in the midst  of its parts,

19. of the rulers of Judah, and rulers of Jerusalem, and mighty ones, and priests, and all the people of the land;

20. and I will give them to their enemies, and into the hand of ones seeking  their life. And [2will be  1their decaying flesh] food to the winged creatures of the heaven, and to the wild beasts of the earth.

21. And  Zedekiah king  of Judea, and  his rulers I will give into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of ones seeking  their life, and into the hands of the force of the king of Babylon -- to the ones running from them.

22. Behold, I order it, says the lord; and I will return them into  this city. And they shall wage war against her, and shall take her, and shall incinerate her in fire; and the cities of Judah -- I will make them for untrodden of ones dwelling.  

## Jeremiah 35

1.  The Rechabites The word  coming to Jeremiah by the lord in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

2. Proceed unto the family of the Rechabites, and call them, and you shall bring them into the house of the lord, into one of the courtyards, and give them [2to drink 1wine].

3. And he led  Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habaziniah, and  his brethren, and  his sons, and all the family of the Rechabites;

4. and they brought them into the house of the lord, into the cubicle of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man  of God, which is near the house of the rulers, above the house of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the one guarding the way.

5. And I set in front of them a clay vessel of wine, and cups, and I said, Drink wine!

6. And they said, In no way should we drink wine, for Jonadab son of Rechab  our father gave charge to us, saying, In no way shall you drink wine, you and  your sons unto the eon.

7. And [3houses 1in no way way 2shall you build], nor [3seed 1in any way 2shall you sow], and a vineyard shall not be to you; for in tents you shall dwell all  your days, so that you should live [2days 1many] upon the land, upon which you spend your time upon it.

8. And we hearkened to the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab  our father in all things which he gave charge to us, to  not drink wine all the days  of our life, we, and  our wives, and  our sons, and  our daughters;

9. for  to not build houses  to dwell in there, and a vineyard and a field, and seed -- it happened not to us.

10. And we lived in tents, and we hearkened, and did according to all as much as [3gave charge 4to us 1Jonadab  2our father].

11. And it came to pass when [4ascended 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king  3of Babylon] upon the land, and we said, In ascending we shall enter into Jerusalem from in front of the Chaldeans, and from in front of the force of the Assyrians. And we lived there.

12. And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

13. Thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Go and say to the man of Judah! and to the ones dwelling Jerusalem. In no way will you take instruction to hear  my word, says the lord.

14. [5established 6the word 1The sons 2of Jonadab 3son 4of Rechab], the one given charge to his children to  not drink wine; and they drank not unto  this day, for they hearkened to the command  of their father. And I spoke to you early, and I spoke and you did not hearken.

15. And I sent to you  my servants the prophets rising early in the morning and sending, saying, Let [2turn 1each] from  [3way 1his  2evil]! And [2better 1do]  in your practices! and you shall not go after [2gods 1other]  to serve them. And you shall live upon the land which I gave to you, and to your fathers. And you leaned not  your ears, and you hearkened not.

16. But [5established 1the sons 2of Jonadab 3son 4of Rechab] the commandment  of their father, which he gave charge to them.  But this people [3not 1heard 2me].

17. On account of this, Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring upon Judah, and upon the ones dwelling Jerusalem all the bad things which I spoke against them. For I spoke to them and they hearkened not. And I called them, and they did not answer.

18. And to the house of the Rechabites, Jeremiah said, Thus said the lord, Since [5hearkened to 1the sons 2of Jonadab 3son 4of Rechab] the commandment  of their father, to do in so far as [2gave charge 3to them  1their father]; on account of this thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel,

19. No way shall there fail a man of the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab standing in front of me all the days.  

## Jeremiah 36

1.  The Scroll against Jerusalem And in the [2year  1fourth] of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

2. Take to yourself a papyrus leaf scroll! and write upon it! all the words which I spoke to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations from which day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah king of Judah, and unto  this day.

3. Perhaps [4will hear 1the 2house 3of Judah] all the bad things which I devise to do to them; that they should turn from [3way 1their  2wicked]; and I will be propitious to their iniquities, and to their sins.

4. And Jeremiah called  Baruch son of Neriah. And Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the lord of which he gave a divine message to him on a papyrus paper scroll.

5. And Jeremiah gave charge to Baruch, saying, I am guarded, and I am not able to enter into the house of the lord.

6. And you shall enter, and shall read with  this papyrus paper scroll into the ears of the people in the house of the lord in the day of the fast. And in the ears of all Judah, of the ones coming from out of their cities, you shall read to them.

7. Perhaps [2will fall 1their need for mercy] in front of the lord, and they will turn from  [3way 1their  2evil]. For great is the rage and the anger of the lord which he spoke against  this people.

8. And [4did 1Baruch 2son 3of Neriah] according to all which [2gave charge to him 1Jeremiah],  to read in the scroll the words of the lord in the house of the lord. 

9.  The Reading of the Scroll And it came to pass in the [2year 1fifth] of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the [2month  1ninth], they held an assembly fast in front of the lord, all the people of Jerusalem, and the house of Judah.

10. And Baruch read in the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the house of the lord, in the house of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the [2courtyard  1upper], in the thresholds [3gate 4of the 5house 6of the lord 1of the 2new], in the ears of all the people.

11. And [6heard 1Micaiah 2son 3of Gemariah 4son 5of Shaphan] all the words of the lord from out of the scroll.

12. And he went down unto the house of the king, unto the house of the scribe. And behold, there all the rulers sat -- Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan son of Achbor, and Gemariah son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the rulers.

13. And [2announced 3to them 1Michaiah] all the words which he heard [2reading  1Baruch] in the scroll, in the ears of the people.

14. And [4sent 1all 2the 3rulers] to Baruch, son of Neriah, the son of Jehudi, son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, The scroll in which you read by it into the ears of the people, take it into  your hand and come! And [4took 1Baruch 2son 3of Neriah] the scroll in  his hand, and went down to them.

15. And they said to him, Again read for  our ears! And Baruch read in  their ears.

16. And it happened as they heard all the words, [2gave advice 1each] to  his neighbor, and they said to  Baruch, By announcing, we should announce to the king all  these words.

17. And  they asked Baruch, saying, From what place did you write all  these words?

18. And Baruch said, From the mouth of Jeremiah. He announced to me all  these words, and I wrote upon a scroll.

19. And [3said 1the 2rulers] to Baruch, Proceed and be hid, you and Jeremiah! Let not a man know where you are! 

20.  The Burning of the Scroll And they entered to the king, into the courtyard, and [2the 3scroll 1they put] to guard in the house of Elishama the scribe. And they announced to the king all  these words.

21. And [3sent 1the 2king]  Jehudi to take the scroll. And he took it from out of the house of Elishama the scribe, and Jehudi read in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the rulers  sitting around the king.

22. And the king was sitting in [2house 1the winter] in [2month 1the ninth], with a grate of fire in front of him.

23. And it came to pass Jehudi having read three columns or four, he shred them with the razor of the scribe, and tossed into the fire, the one upon the grate, until [4vanished 1all 2the 3papyrus leaf] in the fire, the one upon the grate.

24. And they were not amazed, and they tore not  their garments -- the king and all  his servants, the ones hearing all  these words.

25. And Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah suggested to the king to  not incinerate the papyrus paper.

26. And he did not hearken to them. And [3gave charge 1the 2king] to Jerahmeel son of the king, and to Saraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize  Baruch the scribe, and  Jeremiah the prophet -- and they were hidden. 

27.  Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah, after the [2incinerating  1king] the papyrus paper with all the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

28. Again take to yourself [2papyrus paper scroll 1another], and write all the words  being on the papyrus paper scroll which [3incinerated  1king 2Jehoaikim]!

29. And to Jehoaikim, the king of Judah, you shall say, Thus said the lord, You incinerated  this scroll, saying, Why did you write upon it, saying, In entering [3shall enter 1the king 2of Babylon], and shall utterly destroy  this land, and he shall obliterate from it man and beast.

30. On account of this thus said the lord against Jehoiakim king of Judah, There will not be to him one sitting down upon the throne of David; and  his decaying flesh will be for tossing in the sweltering heat of the day, and in the icy coldness of the night.

31. And I will visit against him, and against  his family, and against  his children  their lawlessnesses. And I will bring upon them, and upon the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, and upon the land of Judah, all the evils which I spoke to them; and they heard not.

32. And Jeremiah took [2papyrus paper scroll 1another], and he gave it to Baruch son of Neriah the scribe. And he wrote upon it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll which [4incinerated 1Jehoiakim 2king 3of Judah] in fire, and still were added to it [2words 1many] as these.  

## Jeremiah 37

1.  Zedekiah's Vain Hope And [4reigned 1Zedekiah 2son 3of Josiah] instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom [4gave reign 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon] to reign in the land of Judah.

2. And [2hearkened not 1he], and  his servants, and the people of the land, of the words of the lord which he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah.

3. And [3sent  1king 2Zedekiah]  Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and  Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah, saying, Pray concerning us to the lord  our God!

4. And Jeremiah came and went through the middle of the city, and they did not put him into prison.

5. And the force of Pharaoh came forth from out of Egypt. And [3heard 1the 2Chaldeans] the report of them, and they ascended unto Jerusalem.

6. And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah, saying,

7. Thus said the lord, the God of Israel; Thus shall you say to the king of Judah, the one sending to you  to inquire of me; Behold, the force of Pharaoh  coming forth to you for help, they shall return into the land of Egypt.

8. and [4shall return 3themselves 1the 2Chaldeans], and they shall wage war against  this city, and shall seize it, and shall burn it with fire.

9. For thus said the lord, You should not undertake the thought in your souls, saying, [6running 3shall depart 4from 5us 1The 2Chaldeans]. For in no way shall they depart.

10. And if you should strike all the force of the Chaldeans, the ones waging war against you, and there should be left behind a certain amount having been stabbed, each in  his place, these shall rise up and shall burn  this city by fire. 

11.  Jeremiah is Imprisoned And it came to pass when [5ascended 1the 2force 3of the 4Chaldeans] from Jerusalem from in front of the force of Pharaoh,

12. Jeremiah came forth from Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin  to buy from there land in the midst of the people.

13. And he was himself in the gate of Benjamin. And there was there a man by whom he rested up, Irijah, son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah. And he seized  Jeremiah, saying, [3to 4the 5Chaldeans 1You are 2fleeing].

14. And he said, It is a lie, [2am not 4unto 5the 6Chaldeans 1I 3fleeing]. But he did not listen to him. And Irijah seized  Jeremiah, and brought him to the rulers.

15. And [3were embittered 1the 2rulers] over Jeremiah, and they struck him, and they sent him into the house of the prison of Jonathan the scribe. For this they made into a house of a prison.

16. And Jeremiah came into the house of the pit, and into the confinement, and he stayed there [2days 1many].

17. And Zedekiah sent and called him. And [3asked 4him 1the 2king] secretly, and said to him, Is there  a word from the lord? And he said, It is into the hands of the king of Babylon you shall be delivered up.

18. And Jeremiah said to the king, How did I wrong you, and  your servants, and  this people, that you put me into [2house 1a prison]?

19. And where are  your prophets, the ones prophesying to you, saying that, In no way shall [3come 1the king 2of Babylon] unto  this land?

20. And now hear indeed O lord, O king! Let [2fall  1mercy] for me in front of you! And in no way should you return me unto the house of Jonathan the scribe, and in no way should I die there.

21. And [3ordered 1the 2king], and they put him in the house of the guard, and they gave to him [2bread loaf 1one]  a day from outside of which they baked, until [3failed 1the 2bread loaves] from the city. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.  

## Jeremiah 38

1.  Jeremiah is Lowered into the Pit And [4heard 1Shephatiah 2son 3of Mattan], and Gedaliah son of Pashur, and Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashur son of Malchiah, the words which Jeremiah spoke unto the people, saying,

2. Thus said the lord, The one dwelling in  this city shall die by the broadsword, and by famine, and by pestilence; and the one going forth to the Chaldeans shall live; and [2shall be  1his life] for gain, and he shall live.

3. For thus said the lord, In being delivered up, [2shall be delivered up  1this city] into the hands of the force of the king of Babylon, and he shall seize it.

4. And [3said 1the 2rulers] to the king, Do away with [2indeed  1that man], for he enfeebles the hands of the men  waging war of the ones being left in  this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them according to  these words. For  this man does not speak oracles for peace to this people, but only evils.

5. And [3said  1king 2Zedekiah], Behold, he is in your hands; for [3was not 4able 1the 2king] to resist them.

6. And they took  Jeremiah, and they tossed him into the pit of Malchiah, son of the king, which was in the courtyard of the guard. And they let him down with rough cords into the pit. And in the pit there was no water, but only mire, and he was in the mire.

7. And [6heard 1Ebed-melech 2the 3Ethiopian 5man 4eunuch] (and he was in the courtyard of the king) that they cast  Jeremiah into the pit; and the king was sitting down at the gate of Benjamin.

8. And Ebed-melech went forth from the house of the king, and he spoke to the king, and said,

9. My master, O King, [3did wickedly  2these men 1all] in which they did against  Jeremiah the prophet, dropping him into the pit, that he should die in it from the face  of hunger, for there are no longer bread loaves in the city. 

10.  Jeremiah is Rescued from the Pit And [3gave charge 1the 2king] to Ebed-melech, saying, Take with yourself from here thirty men, and lead him from out of the pit, that he should not die.

11. And Ebed-melech took the men, and he entered into the house of the king, the subterranean part, and he took from there old rags and old rough cords; and he tossed them to Jeremiah in the pit.

12. And he said to him, Put these underneath the rough cords! And Jeremiah did so.

13. And they drew him with the rough cords, and led him up from out of the pit. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard. 

14.  The King Questions Jeremiah And [3sent 1the 2king] and called him to himself into the house Asaliseel, the one in the house of the lord. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], I shall ask you a word, and you shall not hide from me the saying.

15. And Jeremiah said to the king, If I should announce to you, will you not to death put me to death? and if I shall advise you, in no way shall you hear me.

16. And [3swore by an oath 1the 2king] to him secretly, saying, As the lord lives, who appointed us  this life, Shall I kill you, and shall I put you into the hands  of these men, the ones seeking  your life, No!

17. And [2said 3to him 1Jeremiah], Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, If by going forth you should go forth to the governors of the king of Babylon, [2shall live  1your soul], and  this city in no way shall be incinerated by fire; and you shall live, and  your family.

18. But if you do not go forth, [2shall be given  1this city] into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and in no way shall you be delivered from their hands.

19. And [3said 1the 2king]  to Jeremiah, I [2a matter 1have] with the Jews  having fled to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hands, and they shall deride me.

20. And Jeremiah said, In no way shall they deliver you up. Hearken to the word of the lord! which I say to you, and [2better 1it will be] for you, and [2shall live  1your soul]!

21. And if [2do not 3want 1you] to come forth, this is the word which [2showed 3to me 1the lord].

22. Behold, all the women  being left behind in the house of the king of Judah having been led out to the rulers of the king of Babylon; and these women shall say, [3deceived 4you 5and 6prevailed over 7you 1the men 2at peace with you], and they will depose you in slips of your feet; they turned from you.

23. And  your wives, and  your children they shall lead out to the Chaldeans; and you in no way shall you be delivered, for by the hand of the king of Babylon you shall be seized, and  this city shall be incinerated.

24. And [2said 3to him  1Zedekiah], to  Jeremiah, [2no man 1Let] know of  these words! and you shall in no way die.

25. And if the rulers should hear that I spoke to you, and they should come to you, and should say to you; Announce to us what you spoke to the king, you should not hide it from us, then in no way will we do away with you; and what did [3say 4to 5you 1the 2king]?

26. And you shall say to them, I tossed  my plead for mercy before the eyes of the king, to  not return me to the house of Jonathan for me to die there.

27. And came all the rulers to Jeremiah, and they asked him. And he announced to them according to all  these words which [3gave charge 4to him 1the 2king]. And they were silent, for [3was not heard 1the 2matter].

28. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until a time of which Jerusalem was seized.  

## Jeremiah 39

1.  The Fall of Jerusalem And it came to pass in the [2year  1ninth]  of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the [2month  1tenth], came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all  his force against Jerusalem, and they assaulted it.

2. And in the eleventh year  of Zedekiah, in the [2month  1fourth], ninth of the month, [3was broken asunder 1the 2city].

3. And [6entered 1all 2the 3governors 4of the king 5of Babylon] and sat at the gate, the one in the middle, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar, and Nebo-sarsechim, and Nebu-sarkes and Nergal, Sharezer, Rab-mag, and the rest of the governors of the king of Babylon.

4. And it came to pass as [4saw 5them 1Zedekiah 2king 3of Judah], and all the men warriors, that they fled and went forth at night from the city according to the way of the garden of the king through the gate between the wall and the fortification around the wall. And they went forth by the way of Araba.

5. And [5pursued 1the 2force 3of the 4Chaldeans] after them. And they seized  Zedekiah on the other side of Jericho, and they led him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah the city in the land of Hamath. And he spoke against him with judgment.

6. And [4slew 1the 2king 3of Babylon] the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes; and all the rulers of Judah he slew.

7. And the eyes of Zedekiah he blinded. And he bound him with shackles, and he led him unto Babylon.

8. And the house of the king, and the houses of the people [3set on fire 1the 2Chaldeans] with fire, and the wall of Jerusalem they demolished.

9. And the extra of the people, and the ones being left behind in the city, and the ones falling in -- these, they fell to the king of Babylon.

10. And the rest of the people, and the ones being left behind [4removed 1Nabuzar-adan 2the 3chief guard] unto Babylon. And of the poor of the people, the ones who were not anything, [4left behind 1Nabuzar-adan 2the 3chief guard] in the land of Judah. And he gave to them vineyards and fields in  that day.

11. And [4gave charge 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon] concerning  Jeremiah in the hand of Nebuzar-adan the chief guard, saying,

12. Take him and put  your eyes upon him! and you should not do to him anything bad; but as it should be said to you, thus you shall do for him!

13. And [4sent 1Nabuzar-adan 2the 3chief guard], and Nabushasban and Rab-sares and Nergel and Sharezer and Rab-mag and all the governers of the king of Babylon.

14. And they sent and took  Jeremiah from out of the courtyard of the guard, and they gave him to  Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, and they led him out. And he sat in the midst of the people.

15. And to Jeremiah came the word of the lord in the courtyard of the guard, saying,

16. Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian! saying, Thus said the lord  God of Israel, Behold, I bring  my words upon  this city for bad things, and not for good things. And they shall be before you in  that day.

17. And I shall deliver you in  that day, says the lord, and I will not give you into the hands of the men whom you fear from their face.

18. For by delivering, I shall deliver you, and by the broadsword in no way shall you fall. And [2will be  1your life] for gain, for you relied upon me, says the lord.  

## Jeremiah 40

1.  Jeremiah Freed The word  coming to Jeremiah from the lord afterwards with  his being sent by Nabuzar-adan the chief guard from out of Ramah in the taking him in manacles in the midst of the resettlement of Judah, of the ones being led into Babylon.

2. And [3took 4him 1the 2chief guard], and said to him, The lord  your God spoke  these evils against  this place.

3. And the lord did as he said, for you all sinned against him, and hearkened not to  his voice, and [2happened 3to you  1this word],

4. And now behold, I untied you from the manacles, of the ones upon  your hands. If it is good before you to go with me into Babylon, come! and I will put  my eyes upon you. But if not run from here! Behold, all the land before you is for good; and for what is pleasing in your eyes  to go there, go! 

5.  Gedaliah Appointed Over Judah And return to  Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan! whom [3established 1the king 2of Babylon] in the land of Judah. And live with him in the midst of the people! for all the things good in your eyes  to go to -- then go! And [3gave 4to him 1the 2chief guard] a feast and gifts, and sent him.

6. And he came to Gedaliah in Mizpah, and stayed in the midst of the people, of the one being left behind in the land.

7. And [8heard 1all 2the 3leaders 4of the 5force  6in 7the field], they and  their force, that [3established 1the king 2of Babylon]  Gedaliah in the land, and that they deposited to his care men and their wives, and the simple people, and for the needy of the land which he resettled not in Babylon.

8. And came to Gedaliah in Mizpah, even Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maachathite -- they and  their men.

9. And [2swore by an oath 3to them 1Gedaliah] and to their men, saying, Lest you should fear from the face of the servants of the Chaldeans, dwell in the land, and work for the king of Babylon! and it will be better for you.

10. And behold, I sit in Mizpah to stand against the face of the Chaldeans, to whom ever should come against us. And you bring together wine, and autumn fruits, and olive oil, and lay them in  your receptacles, and dwell in the cities which you held!

11. And all the Jews, the ones in Moab, and among the sons of Ammon, and the ones in  Edom, and the ones in all the land, heard that [3granted 1the king 2of Babylon] a vestige  to Judah, and that he placed over them  Gedaliah son of Ahikam.

12. And [4were returned 1all 2the 3Jews] from every place into which they were dispersed. And they came to Gedaliah in the land of Judah in Mizpah. And they gathered wine and autumn fruits -- much, exceedingly, and olive oil. 

13.  Plot Against Gedaliah And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the governors of the force, the ones in the fields, came to  Gedaliah in Mizpah.

14. And they said to him, Do you with knowledge know that Baalis king of the sons of Ammon sent against you  Ishmael son of Nethaniah, to strike your life? and [4did not trust 5them 1Gedaliah 2son 3of Ahikam].

15. And Johanan son of Kareah said  to Gedaliah secretly in Mizpah, I will go indeed, and I shall strike  Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and let no one know! lest he should strike your soul, and should scatter all Judah, the ones being brought together to you, and they shall destroy the rest of Judah.

16. And Gedaliah said to Johanan son of Kareah, You should not do  this thing, for [3lies 1you 2speak] concerning Ishmael.  

## Jeremiah 41

1.  Ishmael Kills Gedaliah And it came to pass in the [2month  1seventh] came Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, from the family of the king, and leaders of the king, and ten men with him to Gedaliah in Mizpah; and they ate [3there 1bread 2together].

2. And Ishmael rose up, and the ten men who were with him, and they struck  Gedaliah by sword, and they killed him, whom [4established 1the 2king 3of Babylon] over the land,

3. and all the Jews  being with him in Mizpah, and all the Chaldeans  being found there. And [2the 3men 4warriors 1Ishmael stuck].

4. And it came to pass in the [2day  1second] of his striking  Gedaliah, that no man knew of it;

5. And there came men of Shechem from Shiloh, and from Samaria -- eighty men, being shaven of beards, and having [3being torn 1the 2garments], and beating their chests, and gifts and frankincense was in  their hands  to carry into the house of the lord.

6. And [4came forth 5to 6meet 7them 1Ishmael 2son 3of Nethaniah] from Mizpah, and they went and wept. And he said to them, Enter to Gedaliah! 

7.  Ishmael Kills the Envoy And it happened in their entering in the midst of the city, that he slew them at the well -- he and the men, the ones with him.

8. And ten men were found there. And they said  to Ishmael, You should not do away with us, for there are with us treasures in the field, wheat and barley, and honey, and olive oil. And he passed by and did not do away with them in the midst  of their brethren.

9. And the well into which Ishmael tossed all whom he struck [2well 1was a great]. This is the one which [3made  1king 2Asa] from fear in front of Baasha king of Israel. This well [4filled 1Ishmael 2son 3of Nethaniah] of slain ones.

10. And Ishmael returned all the people  being left behind in Mizpah, and the daughters of the king who were deposited in the care of the chief guard  by Gedaliah son of Ahikam. And he set out unto the other side of the sons of Ammon.

11. And [4heard 1Johanan 2son 3of Kareah], and all the leaders of the force  with him, all the evil things which [4did 1Ishmael 2son 3of Nethaniah].

12. And he led all  their encamped army, and set out to wage war against him; and he found him at the water of the great pool in Gibeon.

13. And it came to pass when [6saw 1all 2the 3people  4with 5Ishmael]  Johanan son of Kareah, and all the leaders of the force  with him, they were glad,

14. and they returned to Johanan.

15.  But Ishmael escaped with eight men, and set out towards the sons of Ammon.

16. And Johanan took, and all the leaders of the force  with him, all the remnant of the people whom he returned from Ishmael son of Nethaniah from Mizpah -- after  his striking Gedaliah son of Ahikam -- mighty men in war, and the women, and the rest of the things, and the eunuchs, whom he returned from Gibeon.

17. And they set out and stayed in Chimham, the one by Beth-lehem,  to go into Egypt,

18. from the face of the Chaldeans. For they feared from their face, for Ishmael struck  Gedaliah whom [4established 1the 2king 3of Babylon] in the land.  

## Jeremiah 42

1.  Jeremiah's Message to Johanan And [6went forward 1all 2the 3leaders 4of the 5force], and Johanan son of Kareah, and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from small and unto great.

2. And they said to Jeremiah the prophet, Let there fall now  our need for mercy in front of you! And pray to the lord  your God concerning the rest of these! for we are left few from many, as  your eyes see.

3. And let [3announce 4to us 1the lord  2your God]! the way in which we shall go by it, and the word which we shall do.

4. And [4said 5to them 1Jeremiah 2the 3prophet], I heard, behold, I will pray to the lord  our God according to  your words. And it will be the word which [2shall answer 1the lord], I will announce to you; in no way shall I hide from you a word.

5. And they said  to Jeremiah, Let the lord be to us for a [4witness 1just 2and 3trustworthy]! if we do not according to every  word which ever [3should send 4you 1the lord  2your God] to us -- thus we will do.

6. And whether if good or if bad be the voice of the lord  our God, of whom we send you to him, we shall hearken; that [2better 3to us 1it should be] -- for we shall hearken to the voice of the lord  our God.

7. And it came to pass after ten days, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Jeremiah.

8. And he called  Johanan son of Kareah, and the leaders of the force, and all the people, from small and unto great. 

9.  Jeremiah Reassures the Remnant And he said to them, Thus said the lord, the God of Israel, of whom you sent me to him that [2should fall  1your supplication] before him.

10. If staying you should stay in  this land, then I will build you, and in no way shall I demolish; and I will plant you, and in no way pluck. For I have caused rest over the hurts which I did to you.

11. You should not be fearful from the face of the king of Babylon, of whom you fear from his face. You should not be fearful, says the lord. For [2with 3you 1I am],  to rescue you, and to deliver you from out of his hand.

12. And I will grant to you an act of kindness, and I will show mercy on you, and I will return you unto  your land.

13. And if you say to yourselves, In no way should we stay in  this land, to  not hearken to the voice of the lord  your God,

14. saying, Far be it, for [2into 3the land 4of Egypt 1we shall enter], and in no way should we know war, and [3the sound 4of a trumpet 1in no way 2should we hear], and [3in 4bread loaves 1in no way 2should we hunger], and we shall live there.

15. On account of this, hear the word of the lord, O remnant of Judah! Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, If you should put  your face unto Egypt, and should enter in there to dwell;

16. then it shall be the broadsword which you shall fear from its face -- it shall find you in Egypt; and the famine of which you [2a reckoning 1have] from in front of it, it shall overtake you in Egypt, and there you shall die.

17. And it will be all the men, the ones putting  their face  to enter into the land of Egypt to dwell there, they shall fail by the broadsword, and by the famine, and pestilence. And there will not be for them any one delivering from the evils which I bring upon them.

18. For thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, As [2dripped  1my rage] upon the ones inhabiting Jerusalem, so shall [2drip  1my rage] upon you, on your entering into Egypt. And you shall be for an untrodden land, and under one's hands, and for a curse, and for scorning; and in no way shall you behold any longer  this place,

19. which the lord spoke against you, the ones remaining of Judah. You should not enter into Egypt. And now, in knowing, you shall know that I witnessed to you today,

20. that you did wickedly in your souls, sending me to the lord  your God, saying, Pray concerning us! to the lord, and according to all what ever [3should say 4to you 1the lord  2our God], thus you tell us and we will act.

21. And I announced to you, and you hearkened not to the voice of the lord  your God, according to all which he sent to you.

22. And now by the broadsword, and by famine, and by pestilence you shall end in the place in which you wanted to enter to dwell there.  

## Jeremiah 43

1.  The People Reject Jeremiah's Words And it came to pass as Jeremiah ceased speaking to the people all the words of the lord  their God, which [3sent 1the lord  2their God] to them, even all  these words.

2. And [4said 1Azariah 2son 3of Hoshaiah], and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the [2men  1proud], the ones speaking to Jeremiah, [3lies 1You 2speak], [3did not 4send 5you 1The lord  2our God] to us, to say, You should not enter into Egypt to live in there;

3. but Baruch son of Neriah unites with you against us, that you should give us into the hands of the Chaldeans,  to put us to death, and to resettle us in Babylon.

4. And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the leaders of the force, and all the people hearkened not to the voice of the lord to dwell in the land of Judah.

5. And Johanan took, and all the leaders of the force, the whole of the rest of Judah, of the ones returning from all of the nations which they were scattered there, to dwell in the land of Judah;

6. the mighty men, and the women, and the infants remaining, and the daughters of the king, and the souls which [4left behind 1Nabuzar-adan 2the 3chief guard] with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch son of Neriah. 

7.  The People Enter Egypt And they entered into Egypt, for they hearkened not to the voice of the lord; and they entered into Tahpanhes.

8. And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,

9. Take to yourself [2stones 1great], and hide them in the thresholds in the gate of the residence of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, in front of the eyes of the men of Judah.

10. And you shall say, Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Behold, I send for, and I will bring Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon  my servant. And he shall put  his throne upon  these stones which you hid; and he shall lift the shields upon them.

11. And he shall enter, and shall strike the land of Egypt; whom for death unto death, and whom for resettlement unto resettlement, and whom for broadsword unto broadsword.

12. And he shall kindle a fire in the houses  of their gods, and shall set them on fire, and shall resettle them, and shall fumigate the land of Egypt as [2fumigates 1the shepherd]  his garment; and he shall go forth in peace.

13. And he shall break the columns of Heliopolis, the ones in Egypt. And the houses of the gods of Egypt he shall incinerate with fire.  

## Jeremiah 44

1.  The Word against the Jews in Egypt The word  coming to Jeremiah to all the Jews  dwelling in the land of Egypt, and to the ones settling in Migdol, and in Tahpanhes, and in Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, saying,

2. Thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, You have seen all the evils which I brought upon Jerusalem, and upon the cities of Judah. And behold, they are desolate today of ones dwelling,

3. because of the face of their wickedness of which they did to greatly embitter me; going to burn incense [2gods 1to other] which [2knew not 1they], even you, and  your fathers.

4. And I sent to you  my servants the prophets early. And I sent saying, You shall not do this thing,  this contamination of which I detested.

5. And they did not hearken to me, and they did not lean  their ear to turn from  their evils to  not burn incense [2gods 1to other].

6. And [2dripped upon them  1my anger], and  my rage, and it was kindled in the cities of Judah, and outside Jerusalem. And they became for desolation and for an untrodden place, as this day.

7. And now thus said the lord almighty, the God of Israel, Why do you do [2evils 1great] against your souls? to cut off from you, man and woman, infant and one nursing, from the midst of Judah, to  not leave behind for yourselves not one person;

8. to embitter me greatly in the works  of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which you entered to dwell there, that you should be cut off, and that you should become as a curse and for scorning among all the nations of the earth.

9. Have you yourselves forgotten the evils  of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Judah, and the evils  of your rulers, and the evils  of your wives, which they did in the land of Judah, and outside of Jerusalem?

10. And they did not cease unto  this day. And they feared not, and held not to  my orders which I put in front of them, and in front  of their fathers.

11. On account of this, thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel; Behold, I set  my face against you for evil,  to destroy all Judah.

12. And I shall take the remnant of Judah, the ones that established  their face  to enter into the land of Egypt  to dwell there, and they shall fail all in the land of Egypt. And they shall fall by broadsword, and [2by 3famine 1they shall fail], from small unto great. And they will be for scorning, and for destruction, and for a curse.

13. And I will visit against the ones settling in the land of Egypt, as I visited against Jerusalem by broadsword, and by famine, and by plague.

14. And there shall not be one escaping, not one of the ones remaining of Judah, of the ones sojourning in the land of Egypt,  to return into the land of Judah upon which they hope in their souls  to return there. In no way shall they return, except the ones escaping.

15. And they answered to Jeremiah -- all the men  knowing that [2burned incense  1their wives 4gods 3to other], and all the women, [2gathering 1a great], and all the people  settling down in the land of Egypt in the land of Pathros, saying,

16. The word which you spoke to us in the name of the lord, we will not hearken to you.

17. For in doing we will do all the matter which shall come forth out of  our mouth to burn incense to the queen  of heaven, and to offer to her libations, as we did ourselves, and  our fathers, and  our kings, and  our rulers in the cities of Judah, and outside Jerusalem. And we were filled of bread loaves, and we were better off, and [3bad things 1we did not 2see].

18. And as we stopped burning incense to the queen of the heaven, and offering a libation to her of a libation, [2were 4made less 3all 1we], and by broadsword and by famine we failed.

19. And seeing that we burned incense to the queen  of heaven, and offered to her libations, did we without  our husbands make to her cakes, and offer libations to her?

20. And Jeremiah said to all the people, to the mighty men, and to the women, and to all the people  responding to him with words, saying,

21. Did not, concerning the incense of which you burned in the cities of Judah, and outside Jerusalem, you and  your fathers, and  your kings, and  your rulers, and the people of the land, the lord remember? even it ascended unto  his heart.

22. And [2was not 3able 1the lord] still to bear up from in front of the wickedness of your deeds, and from  your abominations which you did; and [2became  1your land] for desolation, and for an untrodden place, and for a curse, as  this day;

23. from in front of which you burned incense, and which you sinned against the lord, and hearkened not to the voice of the lord, and to  his orders, and to  his law; and by  his testimonies you did not go; and [2took hold of 3you  1these evils] as  this day.

24. And Jeremiah said to the people, and to the women, Hear the the word of the lord all Judah, the ones in the land of Egypt!

25. Thus said the lord  God of Israel, You and  your women [2with 3your mouth 1spoke], and  [2by your hands 1fulfilled], saying, In offering, we shall offer  our acknowledgment offerings which we acknowledged, to burn incense to the queen  of heaven, and to offer to her libations. In adhering you adhered to  your acknowledgment offerings, and the offerings which you offered.

26. On account of this, hear the word of the lord all Judah  settling down in the land of Egypt! Behold, I swore by an oath to [3name 1my  2great], said the lord. [2shall 4be 3no longer 1My name] in the mouth of all Judah to say, Live O Lord the lord, in all the land of Egypt.

27. For behold, I have been vigilant against them,  to inflict hurt on them, and to not do good. And [7shall fail 1all 2Judah  3dwelling 4in 5the land 6of Egypt] by broadsword, and by famine, until whenever they shall cease.

28. And the ones escaping from the broadsword shall return into the land of Judah being few in number. And [5shall know 1all 2the 3remnant 4of Judah], the ones sojourning in the land of Egypt to sojourn there, whose word will adhere,  mine or  theirs.

29. And this is the sign, says the lord, to you, That I myself will visit upon you in  this place, that you should know that [2shall adhere  1my words] unto you for evils.

30. Thus said the lord, Behold, I give  Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of ones seeking  his life; as I have given  Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and the one seeking  his life.  

## Jeremiah 45

1.  The Message to Baruch The word which [4spoke 1Jeremiah 2the 3prophet] to Baruch son of Neriah, when he wrote  these words in the scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the [2year  1fourth] of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

2. Thus said the lord the God of Israel, concerning you, O Baruch.

3. For you said, Alas, for the lord added toil upon my misery. I went to bed in my moanings, [3rest 1I did not 2find].

4. You said to him! Thus said the lord, Behold, What I built up I demolish, and what I planted I pluck, even all the land  of mine.

5. And you seek to yourself great things. You should not seek. For behold, I bring bad things upon all flesh, says the lord. But I will give to you  your life for gain in every place wherever you should proceed there.  

## Jeremiah 46

1.  A Day of Vengeance And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah the prophet against all nations,

2. against Egypt, against the force of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, who was at the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which [4struck 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon], which was in the [2year  1fourth]  of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah.

3. Take up weapons and shields, and lead forward to battle!

4. Saddle the horses, mount up the horsemen, and put on  your helmets! Furbish the spears, and put on  your chest plates!

5. Why is it that they are terrified and retreat to the rear? because  their strong ones shall be beaten; [2a flight into exile 1they fled], and they shall not return compassing round about, says the lord.

6. Let not [3flee 1the 2nimble], and let not [3be rescued 1the 2strong] by the north! The ones by the river Euphrates are weakened and have fallen.

7. What is this [2as 3a river 1that shall ascend], even as rivers swell up by water?

8. The waters of Egypt [2as 3a river 1shall ascend]; and he said, I will ascend and cover up the earth; and I will destroy the city and the ones dwelling in it.

9. Mount upon the horses and prepare the chariots! Let come forth the warriors of Ethiopia, and Libyans armed with shields! And ascend, O Lydians, stretch tight the bow!

10. And  that day will be to the lord God of the forces a day of vengeance,  to take vengeance  on his enemies. And [3shall devour 1the 2sword], and be filled, and be intoxicated from  their blood. For there is a sacrifice to the lord of Hosts upon a land of the north at the river Euphrates.

11. Ascend to Gilead, and take balm to the virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you multiplied your cures; [2benefit 1there is no] to you.

12. [2heard 1The nations] your voice, and  [4with your cry 3was filled 1the 2earth]. For warrior against warrior is weakened together, [2fell 1both]. 

13.  The Word to Nebuchadnezzar What the lord spoke by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet concerning the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon  to smite the land of Egypt.

14. Announce in Egypt, and [2audible 1make] in Migdol, and exhort in Memphis! And in Tahpanhes say! Attend to and prepare! for [2devoured 1the sword]  your yew tree.

15. Why did he flee after  [2calf  1your chosen]? He remained not, for the lord disabled him.

16. And  your multitude weakened and fell; and each [2to  3his neighbor 1said], We should rise up and return to  our people and unto  our fatherland, from the face [2sword 1of the Grecian].

17. Call the name Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, Saon Esbeie Moed.

18. As I live, says the king, the lord of the forces, for as  Tabor is in the mountains, and as  Carmel  is by the sea, he shall come.

19. [3items 4for settlement 1Make 2for yourself], O one dwelling, O daughter of Egypt. For Memphis [2for 3extinction 1will be], and shall be called, Woe, by there not existing ones dwelling in her.

20. [2is a heifer 3being bedecked 1Egypt], a broken branch from the north came upon her.

21. And  her hirelings in her are as calves well fed, being maintained in her; for also they turned and fled with one accord. They did not stand, for the day of destruction came upon them, and the time of their punishment.

22. Her voice is as a serpent hissing, for [2in 3sand 1they shall go]. With axes they shall come upon her as ones felling wood.

23. You cut down  her forest! says the lord. For in no way should their number be imagined; for it is multiplied above the locust, and there is no number to them.

24. [4shall be disgraced 1The 2daughter 3of Egypt]. She is delivered into the hands of the people from the north.

25. Says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Behold, I punish  Amon her son by Egypt, and upon  her gods, and upon  her kings, and upon Pharaoh, and upon the ones relying upon him.

26. And I will give them into the hand of the ones seeking  their life, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand  of his servants. And after these things it shall be as in the [2days  1old], says the lord.

27. But you should not be fearful, my servant Jacob, nor should you be terrified Israel. For behold, I deliver you from far off, and  your seed from  their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be tranquil, and shall sleep, and there will not be one troubling him.

28. You should not fear, my child, Jacob, says the lord, For [3with 4you 2am 1I]. For I will appoint consummation among every nation in which I led you out of there. But you in no way will I appoint to cease, and I will correct you in judgment; but [4as innocent 1I will not 2acquit 3you].  

## Jeremiah 47

1.  Judgment against the Philistines And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before the striking of Pharaoh  of Gaza.

2. Thus says the lord, Behold, waters ascend from the north, and will be for a rushing stream, flooding. And it shall flood the land, and the fullness of it; the city and the ones dwelling in it. And [3shall cry out 1the 2men], and [5shall shout 6all together 1the ones 2dwelling 3in the 4land]

3. from the sound of his thrust, from the hoofs  of his feet, and from the quake  of his chariots, the sound of his wheels. [2did not 3turn 1Fathers] unto their sons because of the feebleness of their hands,

4. in the day, in the coming one,  to destroy all the Philistines, and to obliterate  Tyre and Sidon and all the rest  of their helpers, for the lord will utterly destroy the Philistines of the remnants of the islands of Cappadocia.

5. [2is come 1Baldness] upon Gaza; Ashkelon was thrown away, and the remnant of the Anakim.

6. How long will you smite, sword of the the lord? Until when will you not be still? Restore it unto  your sheath! Cause it to rest and be lifted away!

7. How shall it be quiet, and the lord gave charge to it against  Ashkelon, and against the places by the sea, for the remnant to be roused.  

## Jeremiah 48

1.  Judgment against Moab To Moab, thus said the lord of the forces, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo, for it was destroyed; Kiriathaim was taken; [3was shamed 1the 2fortification]; it was vanquished.

2. [2is not 3still 4prancing 1Moab]. In Heshbon he devised for her bad things. Come and we should cut her from being a nation, and by cessation she shall cease; [3behind 4you 2shall proceed 1a sword].

3. For there is a voice of men crying out of Horonaim, ruin and [2destruction 1great].

4. Moab is destroyed. Announce in Zogora!

5. for Luhith is filled with weeping. It shall ascend weeping in the way of Horonaim. [2a cry 3of destruction 1You heard].

6. Flee and escape with  your lives! and you shall be as [2donkey 1a wild] in the wilderness.

7. Since you had relied on your fortresses and in  your treasures, then you shall be seized. And Chemosh shall go forth in resettlement --  his priests and  his rulers together.

8. And [2shall come 1ruin] upon every city; and a city in no way shall be delivered. And [3shall be destroyed 1the 2canyon], and [2shall be utterly destroyed  1the plain], as the lord said.

9. Put signs upon Moab, for by an infection she shall be kindled; and all  her cities [2for 3an untrodden land 1shall be], because of the not being one dwelling in her.

10. Cursed is the one doing the work of the lord indifferently, and cursed is the one lifting away his sword from blood.

11. Moab rested from boyhood, and is relying upon  his glory. He has not poured dregs from receptacle unto receptacle, and into settlement he has not set out. On account of this [2stood 1his taste] with him,  his scent dissipated not.

12. On account of this, behold, days come, says the lord, and I will send to him ones leaning him down, and they shall lean him down, and  [2his vessels 1they shall thin out], and  his horns shall break.

13. And Moab shall be disgraced from Chemosh, as [4was disgraced 1the 2house 3of Israel] from Beth-el their hope, having relied upon themselves.

14. How will you say, We are strong, and each man strong for war.

15. Moab is destroyed. His city and [2choice 3young men 1his] went down to slaughter, says the king -- the lord of the forces is his name.

16. Near is the day of Moab to come, and his harm [2quickly 1very].

17. Move him, all ones round about him! All seeing his name, say! O how is [3broken 2staff 1the renowned], the rod of magnificence.

18. Come down from glory, and sit [2in 3wetness 1being sat down], O daughter of Dibon! for Moab is destroyed; one ascended unto you laying waste your fortress.

19. Upon the way stand and look! O one sitting down in Aroer. And ask the one fleeing and escaping! And say, What happened?

20. Moab was disgraced, for he is broken. Shriek and cry out! Announce in Arnon! that Moab is destroyed

21. and judgment is come unto the land of Misor, upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

22. and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon the house of Diblathaim,

23. and upon Kiriathaim, and upon the house of Gamul, and upon the house of Meon,

24. and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of Moab -- the ones at a distance, and the ones near.

25. [3was broken 1The horn 2of Moab], and  his forearm was destroyed, says the lord.

26. Intoxicate him! for [2against 3the lord 1he was magnified]. And Moab shall strike with his hand, and will be for laughter, even himself,

27. and to us for a joke it was to you, O Israel, and among your stealth he was found, for you waged war along with him.

28. [4left 5the 6cities 7and 8lived 9in 10rocks 1The ones 2dwelling 3in Moab]; they became as doves nesting in rocks, at the mouth of a pit.

29. I heard the insolence of Moab (he insulted exceedingly) and his insult and his pride; and [2was raised up high  1his heart].

30. But I know, says the lord, of his works; is it not  enough for him? Is it not thus he did?

31. On account of this [2for 3Moab 1shriek] on all sides! Yell over men of Keir Heres of squalid conditions!

32. As weeping of Jazer, I shall weep over you. O grapevine of Sibmah, your vine branches went through the sea; [2city 3of Jazer 1they touched]. Upon your autumn fruits and upon your grape gatherers ruin fell.

33. [2was seized 1Cause for joy], and gladness from Carmel, even from the land of the Moabites; and wine in your wine vats [2by morning 1they treaded not], nor at evening. They did not make a joyful acclamation.

34. From a cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz, they gave out their voice; from Zoar unto Horonaim, even as a heifer of three years. For also the water of Nimrim [2for 3burning 1will be].

35. And I will destroy  Moab, says the lord, the one ascending unto the shrine and burning incense to his gods.

36. On account of this the heart  of Moab [2as 3pipes 1shall resonate]; and my heart [4against 5men 6of Keir 7Heres 2as 3a pipe 1shall resonate]. On account of this, what he procured perished from man.

37. Every head in every place shall be shaved, and every beard shall be shaved, and all hands shall beat their chest, and upon every loin there shall be sackcloth,

38. even upon all the roofs of Moab, and upon  its squares. For I broke  Moab, says the lord, as a receptacle of which there is no need of it.

39. O how he reconciled. O how [2turned 3his back 1Moab]. [2was shamed 3and 4became 1Moab] for laughter, and an object of anger to all the ones round about her.

40. For thus said the lord, As an eagle, he shall spread and stetch out  his wings for Moab.

41. Kerioth was taken, and the fortresses were seized. And [6shall be 1the 2heart 3of the 4might 5of Moab] in  that day as the heart of a woman in travail.

42. And Moab shall be destroyed from being a multitude, for [2against 3the 4 lord 1it magnified itself].

43. A snare, and fear, and a pit, are upon you, O one settled of Moab, says the lord.

44. The one fleeing from the face  of fear shall fall into the cesspool; and the one ascending from out of the cesspool even shall be seized in the snare. For I shall bring these things upon Moab in the year of her visitation, says the lord.

45. In the shadow of Heshbon they stopped -- of the force fleeing. For fire came forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and it devoured the side of Moab, and the top of the sons of Saon.

46. Woe to you Moab. [4were destroyed 1the 2people 3of Chemosh]. For they took  your sons and  your daughters for captivity.

47. And I shall return the captivity  of Moab in the last days, says the lord. Unto this is the judgment of Moab.  

## Jeremiah 49

1.  Judgment against Ammon To the sons of Ammon, thus said the lord, [2no 3sons 1Are there] in Israel? or [3inheriting 2no one 1is there] of them? Why did Milcom inherit  Gad, and  their people [2in 3their cities 1dwell]?

2. On account of this, behold, days come, says the lord, and I shall cause to be heard upon Rabbah of the sons of Ammon a tumult of war. And they shall be for an untrodden land, and for destruction. And  her shrines [2by 3fire 1shall be incinerated], and Israel shall inherit  his rule, says the lord.

3. Shout, O Heshbon! for Ai was destroyed. Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah! Gird on sackcloths! Be possessed, and lament over Milcom! For in resettlement [4shall proceed  1his priests 2and  3his rulers] together.

4. Why do you exult in Emakeim, O daughter of the audacity, the one relying upon  her treasures; the one saying, Who shall come to me?

5. Behold, I will bring upon you fear, said the lord of the forces, from all  of your adjacent places. And you shall be scattered each unto his front, and there shall not be  one gathering the runaways.

6. And after these things I will return the captivity of the sons of Ammon, says the lord.

7. To Edom, thus says the lord, There is no more wisdom in Teman. [4was destroyed 1The counsel 2of 3experts]. [2was undone 1Their wisdom].

8. [2was beguiled  1Their place]. Deepen to yourselves into sitting, O ones dwelling in Dedan, for [2difficult 1he made]; I led him in the time which I visited against him.

9. For grape gatherers came to you -- the ones who shall not leave behind to you vestiges. As thieves in the night they shall put their hands.

10. For I dragged down  Esau; I uncovered  their hidden things; [3to hide 1in no way 2shall they be able]; they were destroyed by the hand of his brother, and his neighbor; and he is not.

11. Let [2be left behind 1your orphan] that he should live, and I shall enliven, and your widows [2upon 3me 1shall hope].

12. For thus says the lord, Behold, the ones which were not by law to drink the cup, drank; and you for being acquitted in no way shall be acquitted; for by drinking you shall drink.

13. For according to myself I swear by an oath, says the lord, that for an untrodden land, and for scorning, and for a curse, you will be in the midst of her; and all  her cities shall be wildernesses into eon.

14. In hearing, I heard from the lord, and [2messengers 3unto 4nations 1he sent], saying, Gather together, and come to her! Rise up for war!

15. Behold, [3to be small 1I have appointed 2you] among nations, despicable among men.

16.  Your play took in hand against you; audacity of your heart deposed holes of rocks, it seized the strength [2hill 1of a high]. For if you should raise up high [2as 3an eagle 1your nest], says the lord, from there I will lower you.

17. And Edom will be for an untrodden land. All the ones coming upon her shall be amazed, and shall whistle over all  her calamities.

18. As [6were eradicated 1Sodom 2and 3Gomorrah 4and  5her sojourners], said the lord, in no way shall [2sit 3there 1a man], nor in any way should [3dwell 4there 1a son 2of man].

19. Behold, as a lion he shall ascend from out of the midst of the Jordan unto the place of Aitham. For quickly I will drive them from her. And [2the 3young men 4against 5her 1you set]! For who is as I? And who shall oppose me? And who is this shepherd who shall stand in front of me?

20. On account of this, hear the plan of the lord! which he planned against  Edom; and his device which he devised against the ones dwelling Teman. Surely [5shall be scraped away 1the 2least 3of the 4sheep]. Surely [2shall be made impassable 3for 4them 1their resting-place]?

21. From the sound of their downfall [3was shaken 1the 2earth]. Your cry in the sea was heard.

22. Behold, as an eagle he shall ascend, and shall see, and shall stretch out the wings against her fortresses. And [6will be 1the 2heart 3of the 4strong ones  5of Edom] in  that day as the heart of a woman travailing. 

23.  Judgment against Damascus To Damascus. Hamath was disgraced and Arpad; for they heard [2report 1an evil]. They were startled; they were enraged; [3to rest 1in no way 2shall they be able].

24. Damascus was enfeebled; she was turned to flight; trembling took hold of her; straitness and grief constrained her as one being in travail.

25. O how was she not abandoned, [2city 1praised], the town being loved.

26. On account of this, [2shall fall 1young men] in your squares; and all the men,  your warriors, shall fall in  that day, says the lord of the forces.

27. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the plaza of the son of Hadad.

28. To Kedar and to the queen of the courtyard which [4struck 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon]. Thus said the lord, Rise up and ascend unto Kedar, and strike the sons of Kedem!

29. [2their tents 3and  4their sheep 1They shall take], their garments and all  their vessels; and [2their camels 1they shall take] for themselves. And you call upon them destruction round about!

30. Flee exceedingly! Deepen into sitting! sitting down in the courtyard, says the lord. For [4planned 5against 6you 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon] a plan, and devised against you a device.

31. Rise up and ascend upon [2nation 1a stable]! one sitting down for respite, which there are no doors nor bars -- alone they rest up.

32. And [2will be  1their camels] for plunder, and the multitude of their cattle will be for destruction. And I shall winnow them with every wind, being shaven in front of them; from every side of them I will bring  their enemy routing them, said the lord.

33. And [3will be 1the 2courtyard] for a pastime of ostriches, and an untrodden place unto the eon; in no way shall [2be seated 3there 1a man], nor in any way should [3dwell 4there 1a son 2of man]. 

34.  Judgment Against Elam And came to pass the word of the lord to Jeremiah the prophet against  Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,

35. Thus says the lord of the forces, Behold, I break the bow of Elam, the source of their dominions.

36. And I shall bring upon Elam four winds from the four uttermost parts of the heaven; and I will scatter them in all  these winds; and there will not be a nation which shall not come -- the ones being pushing out of Elam.

37. And I shall terrify them before  their enemies, of the ones seeking  their life. And I will bring upon them evil according to the anger  of my rage, says the lord. And I will send [2as successor 3after 4them  1my sword], until the completely consuming them.

38. And I will put  my throne in Elam, and I will send out from there a king and great men, says the lord.

39. And it will be at the latter ends of the days I will return the captivity of Elam, says the lord.  

## Jeremiah 50

1.  The Word against Babylon The word of the lord which he spoke against Babylon, and against the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.

2. Announce among the nations, and [2audible 1make it]! Lift up a sign and [2audible 1make it]! And you should not hide it. Say! Babylon is captured. Bel was disgraced. Merodach was delivered up. [2were shamed  1their carvings]. [2were delivered up  1Their idols].

3. For ascended upon her a nation from the north. This one put  her land for extinction, and there will not be one dwelling in her from man and beast.

4. They shook and went; in  those days, and in  that time, says the lord, [4shall come 1the 2sons 3of Israel]; they and the sons of Judah together. Proceeding and weeping they shall go [2the 3 lord 4their God 1seeking].

5. [4unto 5Zion 1They shall ask 2the 3way]; for here  [2their face 1they shall set], and they shall come and shall take refuge with the lord; [3covenant 1for 2the everlasting] shall not be forgotten.

6. [4sheep 3perishing 2became  1My people];  their shepherds pushed them out; [2upon 3the 4mountains 1they led them astray]; from mountain unto hill they set out, they forgot their fold.

7. All the ones finding them consumed them.  Their enemies said, We should not spare them, because they sinned against the lord, the pasture of righteousness to the one gathering  their fathers -- the lord.

8. Be separated from out of the midst of Babylon, and from the land of the Chaldeans! And go forth and become as dragons in front of sheep!

9. For behold, I raise up against Babylon gatherings [2nations 1of great] from out of the land of the north, and they shall deploy against her. From there she shall be captured as the arrow [2warrior 1of an expert] shall not return empty.

10. And [3will be 1the 2Chaldeans] for plunder; all the ones despoiling her will be filled up, says the lord.

11. For you were glad, and gloried over plundering  of my inheritance. For you leaped as young bullocks in a pasture, and gored as bulls.

12. [3shamed  1Your mother 2is exceedingly]; [4felt shame 1the one 2giving birth to 3you]. Behold, the last of the nations shall be desolate and untrodden.

13. From the anger of the lord it shall not be dwelt in, and [2will be 3for 4extinction 1all]. And all  traveling through Babylon shall look downcast, and shall whistle at all  her calamity.

14. Deploy against Babylon round about, all stretching the bow! Shoot against her! Spare not against her  your bows! for against the lord she sinned.

15. And secure her! [2were disabled  1Her hands]; [3fell 1the 2parapets]; [2was razed  1her wall]. For [2vengeance 3by  4God 1it is]. Take vengeance against her. As she did, you do to her!

16. Utterly destroy the seed from out of Babylon! the one holding the sickle in the time of harvest, from in front of the Grecian sword. Each unto  his people shall return, and each unto  his land shall flee.

17. [3sheep 2is a wandering 1Israel]; lions pushed him out. The [3first 4devoured 5him 1king 2of Assyria], and this one afterwards  devoured his bones -- the king of Babylon.

18. On account of this, thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel, Behold, I take vengeance against the king of Babylon and  his land, as I took vengeance against the king of Assyria.

19. And I will restore  Israel unto  his pasture. And he shall feed on  Carmel, and in Bashan, and on mount Ephraim, and in  Gilead, and [2shall be satisfied  1his soul].

20. In  those days, and in  that time, says the lord, they shall seek the unrighteousness of Israel, and it will not exist. And they shall seek the sins of Judah, and in no way shall they be found. For [2kindness 1I will be] to the ones being left behind.

21. Upon the land, Bitterly, mount up against her! And against the ones dwelling in her punish by sword, and obliterate! says the lord. And do according to all as much as I give charge to you!

22. The sound of war and [2destruction 1great] in the land of Chaldeans.

23. O how [6was broken in pieces 7and 8defeated 1the 2hammer 3of all 4the 5earth]? O how [2became 3for 4extinction 1Babylon] among the nations?

24. They shall attack you. and you shall be captured, O Babylon, and you did not know. You shall be found and taken, for against the lord you opposed.

25. The lord opened  his treasury, and brought forth the items of his anger; for it is a work for the lord God of the forces, in the land of Chaldeans.

26. For [2have come  1her times]. Open  her storehouses! Search her as a cave, and utterly destroy her! Let [3not be 1her 2vestige]!

27. Dry up all  her fruits, and go down for slaughter! Woe to them, for [2is come  1their day], and a time of their punishment.

28. A sound of ones fleeing and escaping from out of the land of Babylon,  to announce unto Zion the vengeance by the lord our God -- vengeance of his temple.

29. Exhort [2against 3Babylon 1many]! to every one stretching tight the bow. Camp upon her round about! Let there not be her escaping! Recompense to her according to  her works! According to all as much as she did, you do to her! For [2against 3the 4 lord 1she withstood] God, the holy one of Israel.

30. On account of this [2shall fall  1her young men] in  her squares, and all the men,  her warriors, shall be tossed down in  that day, says the lord.

31. Behold, I am against you, O proud one, says the lord  God of the forces; for [2is come  1your day], and the time of your punishment.

32. And [2shall be weakened  1your insolence] and shall fall, and there shall not be  one raising it. And I will kindle a fire in  her forest, and it shall devour all the things round about her.

33. Thus says the lord of the forces, [9have been tyrannized 1The 2sons 3of Israel 4and 5the 6sons 7of Judah 8together]. All the ones capturing them tyrannized them; for they did not want to send them out.

34. But the one ransoming them is strong; the lord almighty is his name. [2equitably 1He will judge] against  his opponents, that [3should be removed 1the 2land]; and he provokes the ones dwelling in Babylon.

35. A sword upon the Chaldeans, says the lord, and upon the ones dwelling Babylon, and upon  her great men, and upon  her experts.

36. A sword upon  her clairvoyants, and they shall be fools. A sword upon  her warriors, and they shall be disabled.

37. A sword upon  their horses, and upon  their chariots, and upon the consolidation (the one in the midst of her,) and they will be as women. A sword upon  her treasures, and they shall be plundered.

38. [2upon  3her water 1It relied]; and they shall be disgraced. For [2a land  3of carved images 1it is], and in the islands they gloried over.

39. On account of this [2shall dwell 1the effigies] among the islands, and there shall dwell in them daughters of sirens. In no way should it be inhabited any longer unto the eon, nor shall it be encamped unto generation and generation.

40. As God eradicated Sodom and Gomorrah and the places adjoining them, said the lord, in no way shall [2dwell 3there 1man], and in no way shall [3sojourn 4there 1a son 2of man].

41. Behold, a people come from the north, and [2nation 1a great], and [2kings 1many] shall be awakened from the end of the earth.

42. [2a bow 3and 4a knife 1They are holding]. They are audacious, and in no way shall they show mercy.  Their voice [2as 3the sea 1shall sound]. Upon horses they shall ride, being prepared as fire for war against you, O daughter of Babylon.

43. [3heard 1The king 2of Babylon] the report of them, and [2were disabled  1his hands]; affliction held him firmly, pangs as a woman giving birth.

44. Behold, as if a lion, he shall ascend from the Jordan into the place Aithan. For quickly I will drive them from her, and [2every 3young man 4against 5her 1I will set]. For who is as I, and who shall oppose me, and who is this  shepherd who shall stand in front of me?

45. On account of this, hear the plan of the lord! which he has planned against Babylon; and his devices which he devised against the ones dwelling the land of the Chaldeans. Surely [4will be utterly destroyed 1the 2little lambs  3of their sheep]. Surely [2shall be removed 1the pasture] from them.

46. For from the sound of the conquest of Babylon [3shall be shaken 1the 2earth], and her cry among nations shall be heard.  

## Jeremiah 51

1.  The LORD Awakens against Babylon Thus says the lord, Behold, I awaken against Babylon, and against the Chaldeans dwelling there [3wind 2burning 1an utterly destroying].

2. And I shall send against Babylon arrogant ones. And they shall insult her, and lay waste  her land. Woe upon Babylon round about in the day of her affliction.

3. Upon her let [3stretch 1the one 2stretching]  his bow, and put on what is his weapons! And spare not against  her young men, and obliterate all  her force!

4. And [2shall fall 1slain] in the land of the Chaldeans, and men being pierced through will fall from outside of her.

5. For [4have not 5been widowed 1Israel 2and 3Judah] from their God, from the lord almighty. For  their land was filled with injustice from the holy things of Israel.

6. Flee from out of the midst of Babylon, and let [2rescue 1each]  his life! You should not be reeling in  her iniquity, for [2the time 3of her punishment 1it is] by the lord; a recompense he shall recompense to her.

7. A cup of gold is Babylon in the hand of the lord, intoxicating all the earth; [3from  4her wine 2drank 1the nations]; on account of this they are shaken.

8. And suddenly Babylon fell, and was broken. Lament her! Take balm  for her hurt! if by any means she should be healed.

9. We medically treated  Babylon, and she would not be healed. We should abandon her, and [2go forth 1each] unto  his land, for [2has approached 3unto 4heaven  1her judgment]. You lifted unto the stars.

10. The lord brought forth  his judgment. Come, for we should announce in Zion the works of the lord  our God.

11. Prepare the bows! fill the quivers! The lord aroused the spirit of the king of the Medes. For [2is against 3Babylon  1his anger], to utterly destroy her. For [2vengeance 3from 4the lord 1it is]; vengeance of his people.

12. Against the walls of Babylon lift up a sign! Set watches! Prepare shields! for [2took in hand 3and 4he will do 1the lord] what he spoke against the ones dwelling Babylon,

13. O ones encamping upon [2waters 1many], and upon the multitude of her treasures, [3is come  1your limit 2truly] into  your intestines.

14. For the lord swore by an oath according to  his arm, saying, For I shall fill you of men as locusts, and [3shall utter a sound 4against 5you 1the ones 2going down];

15. the one making the earth with  his strength, preparing the world in  his wisdom; with  his understanding he stretched out the heaven.

16. At his voice he set a great echo of water in the heaven, and he led clouds from the end of the earth. [2lightnings 3for 4the rain 1He made], and he led light from out of his treasuries.

17. [3has acted moronish 1Every 2man] because of knowledge; [3was disgraced 1every 2goldsmith] because of  their carved images. For [2false gods 1they cast]; there is no breath in them.

18. They are vain works, being scorned. In the time of their visitation they shall be destroyed.

19. Not such is the portion  to Jacob; for the one shaping  all things, he is his inheritance; the lord of the forces is his name.

20. You scatter for me items of war; and I shall scatter [2by 3you 1nations]; and I will lift away [2from 3you 1kings].

21. And I will scatter by you the horse and his rider. And I will scatter by you chariots and their riders.

22. And I will scatter by you husband and wife. And I will scatter by you the old man and child. And I will scatter by you the young man and virgin.

23. And I will scatter by you the shepherd and  his flock. And I will scatter by you the farmer and  his farm. And I will scatter by you governors and your commandants.

24. And I will recompense to Babylon and to all the Chaldeans dwelling there all  their evils which they did against Zion before your eyes, says the lord.

25. Behold, I am against you,  [2mountain  1O corrupting],  corrupting all the earth. And I will stretch out  my hand against you. And I will roll [3downwards 4from you 1the 2rocks], and I will make you as a mountain being set on fire.

26. And in no way shall they take from you a stone for a corner, and a stone for a foundation. For into [2extinction 1eternal] you will be, says the lord.

27. Lift up a sign upon the earth! Trump among the nations with a trumpet! Sanctify [2against 3her 1the nations]! Exhort [2against 3her 1kingdoms] -- Ararat by me, and to the Ashchenazi! Set against her a range of weapons! Haul against her the horses as [2of locusts 1a multitude]!

28. Haul up [2against 3her 1nations]! the king of the Medes and all the earth;  his leaders, and all  of his commandants.

29. [3was shaken 1The 2earth], and toiled because [3rose up 4against 5Babylon 1the device 2of the lord],  to appoint the land of Babylon for extinction, and to not inhabit it.

30. [3failed 1The warrior 2of Babylon]  to wage war, they shall sit there in the citadel. [2was enfeebled  1Their domination]; they became as women; he set on fire  her tents; [2were broken  1her bars].

31. One is pursuing to meet one pursuing to pursue; and one announcing to meet one announcing  to announce to the king of Babylon that [2is captured  1his city].

32. Of the last  of his fords were taken, and  his assemblages were burned by fire, and his men  warriors are coming forth.

33. For thus says the lord of the forces, the God of Israel; The houses of the king of Babylon [2as 3a threshing-floor 4in season 1shall be threshed]; still a little and [2shall come  1her harvest].

34. He devoured me, [4portioned 5me 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon]; [3overtook 4me 2darkness 1a fine]; he swallowed me down as a dragon; he filled  his belly of  my delicacies.

35. [5pushed 6me  1My troubles 2and  3my miseries] into Babylon, [3shall say 1the one dwelling 2Zion]; and,  My blood is upon the [2dwelling there 1Chaldeans], [2shall say 1Jerusalem].

36. On account of this thus says the lord, Behold, I shall judge  your opponent, and I will avenge  your punishment, and I will make desolate  her sea, and dry up  her spring.

37. And Babylon will be for extinction, a dwelling of dragons, an extinction hissing, and it shall not be inhabited.

38. As lions they were aroused together, and as cubs of lions.

39. In  their heat I will give to them a drink, and I shall intoxicate them so that they should be stupefied, and should sleep [2sleep 1an everlasting], and no way should they be roused, says the lord.

40. I shall bring them down as lambs to slaughter, and as rams with kids.

41. O how Sheshach is captured, and [6is hunted 1the 2boasting 3of all 4the 5earth]. O how Babylon became for extinction among the nations.

42. [3ascended 4upon 5Babylon 1The 2sea] with the sound of its waves, and she was covered up.

43. [2became  1Her cities] for extinction, [4land 1a waterless 2and 3untrodden]. There shall not dwell in her not one thing, nor should there rest up in her a son of man.

44. And I shall take vengeance against Babylon, and I will bring forth what she swallowed down from out of  her mouth; and in no way should [3gather 4to 5her 6any more 1the 2nations]. And even the wall of Babylon shall fall.

45. Come forth from his midst my people, and let each deliver  his own life from the anger of the rage of the lord!

46. Lest at any time [2should be consumed  1your heart], and you should be afraid on account of the report which shall be heard in the land, and [2shall come 3in 4a year 1the report], and after the year another report; misery and iniquity over the land, and one dominating over the one dominating.

47. On account of this, behold, days come, and I shall take vengeance upon the carvings of Babylon, and all  their land shall be made ashamed, all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

48. And shall be glad over Babylon the heavens and the earth, and all the ones in them. For from the north comes to him ones utterly destroying, says the lord.

49. And even as Babylon [2to fall 1acted] of the ones slain of Israel, also in Babylon [5shall fall 1the slain 2of all 3the 4earth].

50. O ones being rescued from the broadsword, go and do not stand! Make mention, O ones far off, of the lord, and let Jerusalem ascend upon  your heart!

51. We were ashamed for we heard our scorning. [2covered up 1Dishonor]  our face. For [2entered 1foreigners] into  our holy places, into the house of the lord.

52. On account of this, behold, days come, says the lord, and I will take vengeance against  her carved images. And in all  her land [2shall fall 1the slain].

53. For though Babylon should ascend as the heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength; from me shall come ones utterly destroying her, says the lord.

54. The sound of a cry in Babylon, and [2destruction 1great] in the land of Chaldeans.

55. For the lord utterly destroyed  Babylon. And he destroyed from her [2voice 1a great] sounding as [2waters 1many]; he gave [2for 3ruin 1her voice].

56. For [2came 3upon 4Babylon 1misery]; [2captured  1her warriors]; [2was terrified 1their bow]; for  God recompenses to them.

57. The lord recompenses to her the recompense, and he shall intoxicate [2by intoxication  1her governors], and  her wise men, and  her commandants, says the king -- the lord almighty is his name.

58. Thus says the lord almighty, The wall of Babylon was widened; by razing it shall be razed, and  [3gates 1her  2high] by fire shall be set on fire; and [2shall tire 1peoples] in vanity, and nations [2in 3their rule 1shall fail].

59. The word which the lord gave charge to Jeremiah the prophet to say to Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the [2year  1fourth]  of his kingdom. And Seraiah was ruler of the gifts.

60. And Jeremiah wrote all the evils which shall come upon Babylon in a scroll; all  these words  being written against Babylon.

61. And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, Whenever you should come into Babylon, and shall see, and shall read all  these words;

62. then you shall say, O lord, you spoke against  this place,  to utterly destroy it, and  to not be in it any dwelling from man unto beast, for [2an extinction 3into 4the 5eon 1it will be].

63. And it will be whenever you shall cease  to read  this scroll, that you shall fasten upon it a stone, and shall toss it into the midst of the Euphrates,

64. and shall say, So shall Babylon descend, and in no way shall she rise up from in front of the evils which I bring upon her, and it shall vanish. Until this are the words  of Jeremiah.  

## Jeremiah 52

1.  The Reign of Zedekiah Being the twentieth and one year of Zedekiah in  his taking reign, and [2eleven 3years 1he reigned] in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

2. And he did the wicked thing before the lord according to all as much as Jehoiakim did.

3. For the wrath of the lord was in Jerusalem and in Judah, until of which time the throwing them off from his face, and Zedekiah separated against the king of Babylon. 

4.  The Fall of Jerusalem And it came to pass in the [2year  1ninth]  of his kingdom, in [3month 1the 2tenth], on the tenth of the month, [4came 1Nebuchadnezzar 2king 3of Babylon], and all  his force against Jerusalem. And they encamped by it, and they built against it a rampart round about.

5. And [3came 1the 2city] into conflict until the eleventh year to king Zedekiah.

6. In [3month 1the 2fourth], the ninth of the month, even [3was solidified 1the 2famine] in the city, and there were no bread loaves to the people of the land.

7. And [3was cut through 1the 2city], and all the men  warriors fled and went forth by night according to the way of the gate in the middle of the wall, and the area around the wall, which was next to the garden of the king; (and the Chaldeans were upon the city round about) and they went by the way into the wilderness.

8. And [5pursued 1the 2force 3of the 4Chaldeans] after the king, and overtook him on the other side of Jericho. And all  his servants were dispersed away from him.

9. And they seized the king, and led him to the king of Babylon in Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he spoke to him with judgment.

10. And [4slew 1the 2king 3of Babylon] the sons of Zedekiah in front of his eyes. And all the rulers of Judah he slew in Riblah.

11. And the eyes of Zedekiah were blinded; and he bound him in shackles, and [4led 5him 1the 2king 3of Babylon] into Babylon, and put him into [2house 1the mill] until the day of which he died. 

12.  The Destruction of The LORD's House And in the [2month  1fifth], the tenth of the month, came Nabuzar-ardan the chief guard (the one standing in front of the king of Babylon) unto Jerusalem.

13. And he burnt the house of the lord, and the house of the king, and all the houses of the city; even all [2houses 1the great] he burnt with fire.

14. And every wall of Jerusalem round about was demolished by the force of the Chaldeans  with the chief guard.

15. And from the needy of the people, and the rest of the people, and the ones being left behind in the city, and the ones falling in, the ones who fell to the king  of Babylon, and the extra of the multitude [3moved 1the 2chief guard].

16. And [4some from 5the 6poor 7of the 8land 3left behind 1the 2chief guard] for vine dressers and for farmers.

17. And the columns, the ones of brass, the ones in the house of the lord, and the bases, and the [2sea  1brass], the one in the house of the lord [3broke 1the 2Chaldeans]. And they took  of their brass unto Babylon.

18. And the rim, and the bowls, and the meat hooks, and all the items of brass in which they officiated by them;

19. even the silver things, and the snuffers, and the oil flasks, and the lamp-stands, and the incense pans, and the cups -- which was gold by gold, and which was silver by silver [3took 1the 2chief guard];

20. and the [2columns 1two], and the [2sea 1one], and the [2calves 1twelve] of brass underneath the sea, which [3made  1king 2Solomon] for the house of the lord. [3was not known 1The weight  2of their brass].

21. And the columns -- eighteen cubits was the height of the [2column  1one], and a string measure of twelve cubits surrounded it, and  its thickness [2fingers 1was of four] round about.

22. And the molding upon them was of brass, and [3was five 4cubits 1the 2length], superior of the molding of the one. And a latticed work and pomegranates were upon the molding round about,  all of brass; according to these things was [3column 1the 2second] and pomegranates.

23. And there were the pomegranates -- ninety-six to the one part; and there were in all the pomegranates upon the lattice work round about a hundred. 

24.  Exile to Babylon And [3took 1the 2chief guard]  Seraiah the [2priest  1foremost], and  Zephaniah the priest  being second, and the three of the ones guarding the way.

25. And from the city he took [2eunuch 1one] who was supervisor of the men of the warriors, and seven [2men 1famous] of the ones in front of the king, of the ones being found in the city, and the scribe of the forces, the one acting as scribe to the people of the land, and sixty men from out of the people of the land, of the ones being found in the midst of the city.

26. And [4took 5them 1Nabuzar-ardan 2the 3chief guard], and he led them to the king of Babylon in Riblah.

27. And [3struck 4them 1the king 2of Babylon] in Riblah in the land of Hamath. And Judah was transferred from  its land.

28. This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar transferred in [2year 1the seventh], of Jews -- three thousand and twenty-three.

29. In [4year 1the eighth 2and 3tenth] of Nebuchadnezzar he transferred from Jerusalem [4souls 1eight hundred 2thirty 3two].

30. In [4year 1the third 2and 3twentieth] of Nebuchadnezzar, [3transferred 1the 2chief guard] of Jews [3souls 1seven hundred 2forty-five]. All the souls four thousand and six hundred.

31. And it came to pass in the thirtieth and seventh year of the resettling  of Jehoiakim king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the fifth and twentieth day of the month, [4took 1Evil-merodach 2king 3of Babylon], in the year in which he took reign, the head of Jehoiakim king Judah, and led him from out of the house of which he was guarded.

32. And he spoke to him graciously. And he put  his throne above the thrones of the kings, of the ones with him in Babylon.

33. And he changed  [2apparel  1his prison]. And he ate bread always in front of him all the days which he lived.

34. And the rate [3to him 2given 1always] by the king of Babylon continued from day to day until the day of which he died.
