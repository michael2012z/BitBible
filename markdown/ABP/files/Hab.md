## Habakkuk 1

1.  Habakkuk Complains of Injustice The concern which [4saw 1Habakkuk 2the 3prophet].

2. For how long, O lord, shall I cry out, and in no way should you listen? For how long shall I yell to you being wronged, and you should not deliver?

3. Why did you show to me toils and troubles, to look upon misery and impiety? Right opposite me takes place judgment, and the judge takes away.

4. On account of this [2is effaced 1the law], and [2is not 3administered 4unto 5the end 1judgment], for the impious tyrannize over the just. Because of this [2shall go forth  1judgment] being perverted. 

5.  The LORD Replies Behold, O despisers, and look! and wonder wonders, and vanish! For [3a work 1I 2work] in  your days which in no way you shall believe if any should tell of it in detail.

6. For behold, I awaken the Chaldeans, the [4nation  1bitter 2and  3quick]; the one going upon the widths of the earth,  to inherit tents not of his.

7. [2fearful 3and 4apparent 1He is]; [3of 4himself  1his judgment 2will be], and  his concern of himself shall come forth.

8. And [2shall leap 3more than 4leopards  1his horses], and are sharper than the wolves  of Arabia. And [2shall ride forth  1his horsemen], and shall advance far off; and they shall spread out as an eagle eager for something  to eat.

9. Consumption [2unto 3the impious 1shall come] opposing their fronts right opposite, and he shall gather [2as 3the sand 1the captivity].

10. And he [2among 3kings 1shall revel], and sovereigns are his playthings. And he [2at 3every 4fortress 1shall mock], and shall throw up an embankment, and shall prevail over it.

11. Then he shall turn the spirit, and shall go through, and shall make atonement, saying, This  strength is to my god.

12. Are you not from the beginning, O lord  my God,  my holy one? In no way should we die. O lord, for judgment -- you have ordered it. And he shaped me  to reprove for his discipline.

13. Pure is the eye  to not see evil things, and [2to look 3upon 4evils 1you are not able]. Why should you look upon ones disdaining? Shall you remain silent in the [2swallowing down 1impious] the just?

14. And will you make the men as the fishes of the sea, and as the reptiles not having one taking the lead?

15. [2consumption 3with 4a hook 1He pulled up], and drew it with his casting-net, and gathered it in  his dragnets. Because of this he shall be glad and shall rejoice.

16. Because of this he will sacrifice to his dragnet, and burn incense to his casting-net; for by them he fattened his portion, even  [3foods 1his 2choice].

17. On account of this he will cast his casting-net, and always to kill nations -- not sparing?  

## Habakkuk 2

1.  The Just Shall Live by My Belief Upon  my watch I will stand, and I will mount upon a rock. And I will watch over  to behold what he should speak in me, and what I will answer upon  my being reproved.

2. And [2answered 3to 4me 1the lord] and said, Write the vision clearly onto a writing-tablet, so that [4should take flight 1the one 2reading 3these things].

3. For the vision is yet for a time, and it shall rise in the end, and not in vain. If he should lack, wait for him! for in coming he shall come and in no way should he delay.

4. If he keeps back, [2favors not  1my soul] in him; but the just one [2by 3my belief 1shall live]. 

5.  Woe to the Wicked But the one being arrogant and despising, [2man 1the ostentatious], not one thing in any way should he have achieved, who widened [2as  3Hades  1his soul], and so as death not being filled up, even he shall assemble unto himself all the nations, and will take in to himself all the peoples.

6. [2not 4these 3all 6a parable 7against 8him 1Shall 5take up], and a riddle for his narrative? And they shall say, Woe, the one multiplying to himself the things not being his -- how long? even the one oppressing  his collar densely.

7. For suddenly [3shall raise up 1ones biting 2him], and [3shall sober up 1the 2plotters against you], and you will be for ravaging to them.

8. Because you despoiled [2nations 1many], [5shall despoil 6you 1all 2the 4being left 3peoples], because of the blood of men, and the impious deeds of the land and city, and all of the ones dwelling in it.

9. O, the one overabounding in a desire for [2wealth 1evil] to his house,  to arrange [2in 3the height 1his nest],  to pull out from the hand of evils.

10. You deliberated shame to your house; you finished off many peoples, and [2was led into sin  1your soul].

11. For the stone [2from 3the wall 1shall yell out]; and the beetle from out of the wood shall utter its sounds.

12. Woe, the one building a city in blood, and prepares a city by iniquities.

13. [2these not 1Are] from the lord almighty that [3failed 2peoples 1fit] by fire, and [2nations 1many], and they became faint-hearted?

14. For [3shall be filled 1the 2earth]  to know the glory of the lord, as water covers up seas.

15. O, the one giving a drink  to his neighbor [4diet of lees 1a clouded 2and 3intoxicating], so that he should look upon  their private parts.

16. [2to the fullness 3of the dishonor 4of 5your glory 1Drink], and be excited! [4encircled 5you 1The cup 2of the right hand 3of the lord], and [2was brought 1dishonor] upon  your glory.

17. For the impiety  of Lebanon shall cover you, and the misery from wild beasts shall terrify you, because of the blood of men, and the impious deeds of the land, and of the city, and of all the ones dwelling it.

18. What benefit is the carved image that they carved it? He shaped it for a molten casting, [2visible display 1a false]. For [3has relied 1the one 2shaping] upon the thing shaped by him in the making of [2idols 1mute].

19. Woe, the one saying to the wood, Sober up, arise! And to the stone, Be exalted! But it is only a visible display, and it is a hammered piece of gold and silver, and [2at all 1no breath] is in it.

20. But the lord is in [2temple 1his holy]; let [4venerate 5from 6before 7him 1all 2the 3earth]!  

## Habakkuk 3

1.  Habakkuk's Prayer The prayer of Habakkuk the prophet with an ode.

2. O lord, I listened to  your report, and I feared. O lord, I contemplated  your works, and was startled. In the midst of the two living creatures you shall be known; in the approaching of the years you shall be recognized; in the [2at hand  1time] you shall be made manifest when  [2is disturbed  1my soul]; in wrath [2mercy 1you shall remember].

3.  God [2from out of 3Teman 1shall come], even the holy one from out of the mount of the shady Paran. PAUSE. [2covered 3the 4heavens  1His virtue], and  his praise filled the earth.

4. And his brightness [2as 3light 1will be], and horns in his hands. And he established [2affection 1a strong] by his strength.

5. Before his face shall go a word, and it shall go forth for a flat ground.

6. At his feet [3stood 4and 5shook 1the 2earth]; he looked and [2melted 1nations]; [3were broke through 1the 2mountains] by force; [4melted away 3hills 1the 2eternal] --  [2ways 1his eternal].

7. [5in 6troubles 1I beheld 2the 3tents 4of Ethiopians], [7shall be disturbed 1and 2the 3tents 4of the 5land 6of Midian].

8. Were [2at 3the rivers 1you provoked to anger], O lord, or [2at 3the rivers  1was your rage], or [2at 3the sea  1was your impulse]? The one riding upon  your horses, and  your riding is deliverance.

9. Stretching out, you shall stretch out  your bow against the chiefdoms, says the lord. PAUSE. [2of rivers 3shall be torn 1The land].

10. They saw you, and [2shall travail 1peoples]. You shall disperse waters of the coursing. [3gave out 1The 2abyss]  her voice -- the height  of his visible display.

11. [3was exalted 1The 2sun], and the moon stood in  her order. At the light of your arrows they shall go forth, and [2in 3brightness 4of lightning  1your weapons].

12. By intimidation you shall make [3few 1the 2land], and in rage you shall break nations.

13. You came forth for deliverance of your people,  to deliver  your anointed one. You threw [2onto 3the heads 4of lawless ones 1death]; [4you rose 5bonds 6unto 7the 8neck 1For 2the 3completion].

14. You cut [3for 4astonishment 1heads 2of mighty ones]; they shall shake in it; they shall open wide their bridles as the [2eating 1poor] in private. You divided into parts in stupefaction the heads of the mighty. They shall shake in it. They shall open  their reins as [2chewing 1the poor] in concealment.

15. And you conducted [2into 3the sea  1your horses], disturbing [2waters 1great].

16. I watched, and [2was terrified  1my belly] from the sound of the prayer of my lips; and [2entered 1trembling] into  my bones, and my part beneath. [2was disturbed  1My manner]. I will rest in a day  of my affliction  for me to ascend to the people  of my sojourn. 

17.  An Ode of Belief For though the fig-tree shall not bear fruit, and there shall not be produce on the grapevines; [5shall lie 1and the 2work 3of the 4olive], and the plains shall not produce food, [2cease 3from 4having food 1and sheep], and [2shall not exist 1the oxen] at the stables;

18. yet I [2in 3the 4 lord 1shall exult]; I will rejoice over  God  my deliverer.

19. The lord  God is my power, and he will arrange  my feet unto completion; and upon the high places he shall set me,  for me to overcome by  his ode.
