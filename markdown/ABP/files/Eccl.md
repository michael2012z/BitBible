## Ecclesiastes 1

1.  The Folly of Life The sayings of an ecclesiastic, son of David, king of Israel in Jerusalem.

2. Folly of follies, said the ecclesiastic, folly of follies;  all things are folly.

3. What is abundance to man in all his trouble in which he is troubled under the sun?

4. A generation goes, and a generation comes, and the earth [2into 3the 4eon 1is established].

5. And [3rises 1the 2sun], and [3goes down 1the 2sun], and [2unto  3its place 1it draws].

6. In its rising it goes forth to the south, and it circles to the north; [3circles 5circling 4going 1the 2wind], and at its circuits [3returns 1the 2wind].

7. All the rushing streams go into the sea, and the sea is not filled up. To the place where the rushing streams went, there they shall return  to go again.

8. All  [2words 1wearied 4shall not 5be able 3a man]  to speak; and [2shall not 3be filled up 1the eye]  to see, and [2shall not 3be filled 1the ear] of hearing.

9. What is the thing taking place? the same thing as shall be taking place. And what is the thing being done? the same thing that shall be done; and there is not anything newly made under the sun.

10. Who shall speak and shall say? Behold this is new! Already it has happened in the eons to the ones having taken place from before us.

11. There is no remembrance to the first things; and indeed to the last things being, there will not be a remembrance of them, with the ones being born at the latter end.

12. I an ecclesiastic became king over Israel in Jerusalem.

13. And I gave  my heart  to inquire and  to survey by  wisdom concerning all things  happening under the heaven. For [4distraction 3a wicked 2gave  1God] to the sons  of men  to be distracting  to him.

14. I beheld all the actions, the ones being done under the sun; and behold, all was folly and a resolve of spirit.

15. The thing being perverted is not able  to be embellished. And deficiency is not able to be counted.

16. I spoke in my heart  to say, Behold, I was magnified, and was added wisdom over all who came before me in Jerusalem. And I give my heart  to know wisdom and knowledge.

17. And my heart beheld much wisdom and knowledge, parables, and higher knowledge. [3knew 2I 1For] even indeed this is resolve of spirit.

18. For in abundance of wisdom is abundance of knowledge; and the one adding knowledge shall add pain.  

## Ecclesiastes 2

1.  The Folly of Pleasure and Wealth I said in my heart, Come now indeed, I will test you with gladness, and therefore know  good! And behold, also even this is folly.

2. To laughter, I said, Deviation. and to gladness, Why do you do this?

3. And I surveyed if  my heart would draw [2with 3wine  1my flesh]; and my heart guided me in wisdom; and  to hold upon gladness until I should see what kind was the good to the sons  of men, which they shall do under the sun [2numbered 3days 4of life 1with their].

4. I magnified my action; I built to myself houses; I planted my vineyards.

5. I made to myself gardens and parks; and I planted in them a tree for every fruit.

6. I made to myself pools of waters  to water by them the grove bursting forth rees.

7. I acquired manservants, and maidservants; and native-born servants were born to me; and indeed a possession [2herd 3and 4flock 1of a great] became to me above all the ones being before me in Jerusalem.

8. I brought together to myself also indeed silver, and indeed gold, and prized possessions of kings and of the places. I prepared to myself male singers and female singers, and amusements of the sons  of man; and male wine servers and female wine servers.

9. And I became magnified, and proceeded in wisdom past all the ones being before me in Jerusalem; and indeed my wisdom was established to me.

10. And all whatever [2asked for  1my eyes] was not at a distance from them. I did not detain  my heart from any gladness, for my heart was gladdened in all my effort. And this was my portion of all my effort.

11. And I looked upon all my actions, the things which I did  by my hands, and on the effort in which I made an effort  to do. And behold,  all things were folly and a resolve of spirit, and there is no advantage under the sun.

12. And I looked around  to behold wisdom and deviation and folly; for who is the man who will come after  counsel, with  as much as they did it?

13. And I beheld that there is an advantage to wisdom over  folly; as the advantage of the light over the darkness.

14. The wise man --  his eyes are in his head; but the fool [2in 3darkness 1goes]. And I knew, even indeed I, that [2event 1one] shall meet with  all them.

15. And I said in my heart, As the event of the fool is, even indeed to me it shall meet up with me; and why have I discerned wisdom? And this extra I said in my heart, because the fool from out of abundance speaks, for even indeed this is folly.

16. For there is no remembrance of the wise man with the fool in the eon; in so far as already the [2days  1coming]  all things are forgotten; and how shall [3die 1the 2wise man] with the fool?

17. And I was detested with  life; for evil was upon me -- the action  of doing a thing under the sun. For all is folly and a resolve of spirit.

18. And I detested all my effort which I made an effort under the sun. For I must leave it to the man  coming after me.

19. And who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool? And if he exercises authority in all my effort in which I made an effort in, and in which I gained discernment under the sun. Even indeed this is folly.

20. And I turned  to dismiss  my heart upon all effort in which I made an effort under the sun.

21. For there is a man that made his effort in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in courage; and a man in whom did not make an effort -- in him he will give to him his portion. And indeed this is folly and [2wickedness 1great]

22. What happens to the man in all his effort, and in resolve of his heart in which he makes an effort under the sun?

23. For in all  his days are pains and rage of his distraction; and indeed in night [3does not 4go to bed  2heart 1his]. And indeed this is folly.

24. There is not a good thing to man unless  to eat and  to drink, and  to show  his soul good in his effort. And indeed this I knew, that [2from 3the hand  4of God 1it is].

25. For who shall eat, and who shall drink besides him?

26. For to the man, to the one good before his face, he gave wisdom, and knowledge, and gladness. And to the one sinning, he gave distraction  to be added and  to bring together; so as to give to the good man before the face  of God. For even indeed this is folly and resolve of spirit.  

## Ecclesiastes 3

1.  To All Things There is a Time and Season To all the time and season, to every thing under the heaven.

2. A season  to give birth, and a season  to die; a season  to plant, and a season  to pluck out the thing being planted;

3. a season  to kill, and a season  to heal; a season  to demolish, and a season  to build;

4. a season  to weep, and a season  to laugh; a season  to lament, and a season  to dance;

5. a season  to throw stones, and a season  to gather stones; a season  to embrace, and a season  to be far from embrace;

6. a season  to seek, and a season  to lose; a season  to keep, and a season  to cast out;

7. a season  to tear, and a season  to sew; a season  to be quiet, and a season  to speak;

8. a season  to be fond of, and a season  to detest; a season of war, and a season of peace.

9. What advantage of the one doing things in which he makes an effort?

10. I saw with the distraction which God gave to the sons  of men  to be distracting to him.

11. All which he made is good in his season; and indeed with the eon he gave in their heart, so that [2should not 3find  1man] the action which God did from beginning till end.

12. I knew that there is not good in them, except  to be glad and  to do good in his life.

13. And indeed, every  man who shall eat and shall drink and should behold good in all his effort -- [2a gift 3of God 1it is].

14. I knew that all things as many as God did, they shall be into the eon. Unto them it is not to add, and from them it is not to remove. And  God did that they should fear from in front of him.

15. The thing becoming, already is; and as much as  there is to be, already has become; and  God shall seek the thing pursuing.

16. And still I beheld under the sun the place of the of judgment -- there the impious one; and a place of the just -- there was the pious one.

17. I said in my heart, With the just and with the impious, God will judge, for there is a season  for every thing, and for every  action there.

18. I said in my heart, concerning the speech of the sons  of man, that [2will examine 3them  1God], and to show that they are beasts.

19. And indeed to them the event of the sons  of man, and the event of the beast is [2event 1one] to them; as the death of this one, so also the death of this other one; and [2breath 1one]  to all. And what abounded the man more than the cattle? Nothing. For all things are folly.

20. All things go to [2place 1one]; all things came from the dust, and all things return to the dust.

21. And who has known the spirit of the sons  of man, if it ascends itself upward? and the spirit of the beast, if it goes down itself below into the earth?

22. And I saw that there is no good, except where [2shall be glad 1man] in his actions; for it is his portion. For who will lead him  to see in what ever should take place after him?  

## Ecclesiastes 4

1.  Inequalities of Life And I turned and I beheld all the extortions, the ones happening under the sun. And behold, the tear of the ones being extorted, and there is not one comforting them. And by the hand of ones extorting them was by strength, and there is not one comforting them.

2. And I praised all of the ones having died of the ones already dying more than the living, as many as live until the present.

3. And better above  these two which not yet was born, which knew not all the [2action  1evil]  being done under the sun.

4. And I beheld all the effort, and all courage  of action; for the same zeal of man is from  his companion. And indeed this is folly and resolve of spirit.

5. The fool embraces  his hands, and eats  his flesh.

6. Better [2full 1a handful] of rest, than [3full 1two 2handfuls] of trouble and resolve of spirit.

7. And I turned, and I saw folly under the sun.

8. There is one alone, and there is not a second; and indeed, [2son 3nor 4indeed 5a brother 1there is no] to him. And there is no limit  to all his effort; and indeed his eye is not satisfied of riches; and saying, Why do I make an effort, and deprive  my soul of goodness? And indeed, this [2folly 3and 5distraction 4an evil 1is].

9. Better the two than the one, in which there is to them [2wage 1a good] in their effort.

10. For if they should fall, the one shall raise  his partner. But woe to him, to the one, whenever he should fall and there should not be a second  to raise him.

11. And if [2should go to bed  1two] and heat themselves, then the one, how shall he heat himself?

12. And if one prevails against the one, the two shall stand against him. And the [2cord  1three-stranded] shall not be quickly ripped apart.

13. Better [4child 1a needy 2and 3wise], than [4king 1an older 2and 3foolish] who does not know  to take heed any longer.

14. For from out of the house of the prisoners he shall come forth  to reign, for even indeed in his kingdom he was needy.

15. I beheld all of the living, of the ones walking under the sun, with the young of the second generation who will stand in place of him.

16. There is no limit  to all the people,  to all as many as was before them; and indeed, the last shall not be glad in himself. For even indeed this is folly and resolve of spirit.  

## Ecclesiastes 5

1.  Life's Experiences Guard  your foot whenever you should go into the house  of God and are near  to hear! [3be above 4the gift 5of the 6fools 2sacrifice 1Let your], for they are not knowing  to do bad.

2. Do not hasten with your mouth, and [2your heart 1let not] hasten  to bring forth a word before the presence  of God! For  God is in the heaven upward, and you are upon the earth; Upon this let [2be  1your words] few!

3. For [2comes through 1a dream] in a multitude of testing; and the voice of a fool in a multitude of words.

4. As when you vow a vow  to God, you should not pass time  to render it, for [2is not 1his will] in foolish vows. You then, as much as you should have vowed, render!

5. Better  [2to not 3make a vow 1for you], than  for you to make a vow and not repay.

6. You should not give  your mouth  to lead [2into sin  1your flesh]; and you should not say before the presence  of God that, It is in ignorance; lest [2should be provoked to anger  1God] at your voice, and should utterly destroy the things made by your hands.

7. For in a multitude of dreams, and follies, and [2words 1many], that with  God you should fear.

8. If [2extortion 3of the needy 4and 5seizure 6by lawsuit 7and 8judicial right 1you should see] in a place, you should not wonder over the thing; for a high one [2above 3a high one 1shall guard], and high ones over them.

9. And the abundance of the earth [2for 3all 1is]; even a king needs the [2of a field 1working].

10. The one loving silver shall not be filled of silver; nor one who loved [2in 3their abundance 1the offspring]. And indeed this is folly.

11. In a multitude  of goodness [4are multiplied 1the ones 2eating 3of it]; and what courageous thing is it to the one having it, but the sum of the seeing it with his eyes?

12. [2is sweet 1Sleep] for the servant, if [2little 3or 4if 5much 1he shall eat]. And to the one being filled  to be rich there is none allowing him  to sleep.

13. There is a sickness which I beheld under the sun -- riches being kept  by him, for his hurt.

14. And [2shall be destroyed  1those riches] in [2distraction 1an evil]; and he engenders a son, and is there not [2in 3his hand 1anything].

15. As he came forth from the womb of his mother naked, he shall return  to go as he comes, and nothing shall he take in his effort, that it should go with him in his hand.

16. And indeed this is an evil sickness; for as he came, so also he shall go forth. And what is his advantage in which he makes an effort into the wind?

17. And indeed all  his days are in darkness, and in mourning, and [2rage 1much], and sickness, and bitter anger.

18. Behold, I saw good, which is good  to eat and  to drink; and  to see goodness in all his effort in what ever he should make an effort in under the sun, in the number of days of his life which [2gave 3to him  1God]. For it is his portion.

19. And indeed, every man to whom [2gave 3to him  1God] riches and possessions, and gave to him authority  to eat from it, and to take  his portion, and  to be glad in his effort; this [2a gift 3of God 1is].

20. For he will not much remember the days  of his life, for  God distracts him in the gladness of his heart.  

## Ecclesiastes 6

1.  The Folly of Wealth and Honor There is a wickedness which I beheld under the sun, and it is abundant with  men.

2. A man to whom [2shall give 3to him  1God] wealth, and possessions, and glory, and there is nothing lacking to his soul from all things which he shall desire; yet [2shall not 3give authority to him  1God]  to eat from it; for a man, a stranger, shall eat it. And this [2folly 3and 5sickness 4an evil 1is].

3. If [2should engender 1a man] a hundred, and [3years 2many 1shall live], and [2abundant 1however] will be the days of his years, that  his soul shall not be filled up from goodness, and indeed [2no burial 1there be] for him. I said, Better for him the miscarriage.

4. For in folly he came, and in darkness he goes, and in darkness his name shall be covered.

5. And indeed [2the sun 1he knew not], and [2knows not 3rest 1this one] over this other one.

6. And if he lived a thousand years of returns, and [2goodness 1he knows not], is it not unto [2place 1one] all shall go?

7. Every effort of man is for his mouth, and indeed the soul shall not be filled.

8. For what advantage to the wise over the fool, for the needy knows to go in front of  life?

9. Better vision of eyes, than going in life; for indeed this is folly and resolve of spirit.

10. If anything became, already [2has been called 1its name]; and it is known what man is, and he is not able to judge against the one stronger than he.

11. For there are [2matters 1many] multiplying folly.

12. What extra is to man? For who knows what is good to man in  life, during the number of the life of the days of his folly? And he spent them as a shadow; for who shall report  to man what will be after him under the sun?  

## Ecclesiastes 7

1.  Comparing Wisdom and Folly A good name is above [2oil 1good], and the day  of death above the day of birth.

2. It is good to go into a house of mourning, than than to go into a house of a banquet; in so far as this is the end of every man; and the living man will give good to his heart.

3. Better is rage than laughter, for by hurt of countenance [2will be made better 1the heart].

4. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; and the heart of fools is in the house of gladness.

5. It is good  to hear the reproach of the wise, than for a man to hear songs of fools.

6. As the sound of the thorn-bushes burning under the kettle, so the laughter, the one of the fools; and indeed this is folly.

7. For  extortion drives [2mad 1the wise man], and destroys the [3heart 1magnanimity 2of his].

8. Better the last of matters than its beginning; better the lenient than high spirit.

9. You should not hasten in your spirit  to be enraged, for rage [2in 3the bosom 4of fools 1shall rest].

10. You should not say, What happened that the [2days  1former] were good over these? for [2not 3in 4wisdom 1you asked] concerning this.

11. [2is good 1Wisdom] with an allotment and abundance to the ones viewing the sun.

12. For [2in 3its shadow  1wisdom] is as the shadow of silver; and the advantage of the knowledge  of wisdom will restore to life the one having it.

13. Behold the actions  of God! For who shall be able  to adorn what ever  God should turn from him?

14. In the day of goodness live in good! and look out in the day of evil! Behold! and indeed with one [3harmony 4with these  2caused  1God] concerning speech, that [2should not find 1man 4after 5him 3anything].

15. All things I beheld in days of my folly. There is a just man being destroyed in his justice, and there is an impious man abiding in his evil.

16. Do not become [2righteous 1super], nor discern extra, lest at any time you should be overwhelmed!

17. You should not be [2impious 1super], and do not become hard, that you should not die in  your time!

18. It is good  for you to hold fast by this; and indeed of this you should not defile  your hand. For to the ones fearing  God all things shall go forth.

19.  Wisdom will give help to the wise one over ten exercising authority, of the ones being in the city.

20. For [3man 1there is no 2just] on the earth who shall do good and shall not sin.

21. And indeed unto all the words which they shall speak, you should not put them to your heart, so that you should not hear  your servant cursing you.

22. For very often he will act wickedly against you, and returning many times he shall inflict your heart; that as also indeed you cursed others.

23. All these things I tested in  wisdom. I said, I shall be discerning, but it was far from me.

24. Far above what was, and a deep depth -- who shall find it?

25. [4circled about 1I 2and  3my heart]  to know, and  to survey, and  to seek wisdom, and the reckoning of things, and  to know the impious man's foolishness, and rioting, and deviation.

26. And I find her more bitter than death -- with the woman in which [2is 3snares 4and 5dragnets 1her heart], and a bond in her hands. He that is good before the face of God shall be delivered from her; and the one sinning will be seized with her.

27. Behold! this I found, said the ecclesiastic, counting one by one, to find a device,

28. which [2anxiously sought  1my soul], and I did not find. Even [2man 1one] from out of a thousand did I find. And a woman among all these I did not find.

29. Except behold! this I found, that God dealt with the [2man 1upright]. And they sought [2devices 1many]. Who knows the wise? And who knows the loosening of a saying?  

## Ecclesiastes 8

1.  Life's Actions [2wisdom 1A man's] will lighten his countenance; and an impudent man's countenance  will be detested.

2. [2the mouth 3of a king 1Watch]! even because of the word of the oath of God.

3. [2not 3hurriedly 5from 6his face 1You should 4go]. You should not stand in [2matter 1an evil], for what ever he wants, he does.

4. As a king exercising authority, and who shall say to him, What do you do?

5. The one keeping the commandment shall not know [2matter 1an evil]. And [4the time 5of judgment 3knows 1the heart 2of the wise].

6. For every thing there is a season and judgment; for knowledge  of man is vast unto him.

7. For there is not one knowing what  shall be being; for as it will be, who shall announce to him?

8. There is no man exercising authority over spirit  to restrain with the spirit; and there is no exercising authority in the day of death; and there is no discharge in the day of battle; and [2shall not 3preserve 1impiety] the thing for her.

9. And all this I beheld; and I gave  my heart to every  action which I had done under the sun; the things, as much as [2exercises authority 1a man] to a man  to inflict evil on him.

10. And then I beheld the impious [2into 3the tombs 1being brought], and from out of the holy place; and they went and were praised in the city, because they did thus. And indeed this is folly.

11. Because there is no existing objection for the ones doing  evil quickly, therefore by this [4have full assurance 1the heart 2of the sons  3of man] in themselves  to do  evil.

12. The one who sinned did  evil from then, and of their duration. For also even I know that there is good to the ones fearing  God, so that they should fear from in front of him.

13. But [2good 1it will not be] to the impious, and he shall not prolong his days which are as a shadow; for he is not fearing from before  God.

14. There is a folly which is done upon the earth; that there are just ones that attain unto them, as the action of the impious; and there are impious that attain to them, as the action of the just. I said that, Indeed also this is folly.

15. And I praised with the gladness, because there is no good thing to man under the sun, were it not  to eat, and  to drink, and  to be glad. And it will adhere to him in his effort all the days of his life, as [2gave 3to him  1God] under the sun.

16. Whereupon I gave  my heart  to know  wisdom, and  to behold the distraction  being done upon the earth. For also at day and at night [3sleep 4with 5his eyes 1a person is not 2seeing].

17. And I beheld all the actions  of God, that [2shall not 3be able 1man]  to find out the action  being done under the sun. As long as [2should make an effort  1man]  to seek, even he shall not find it. And indeed, as long as [2should speak  1the wise]  to know it, he shall not be able  to find it. For all this I gave to my heart, and my heart [2all 1beheld] this.  

## Ecclesiastes 9

1.  The Common Destiny of All As the just, and the wise, even  their works are in the hand  of God. Indeed even love, indeed even hatred, there is no [2knowing  1man] all the things before them.

2. Folly is in  all things; [2event 1there is one] to the just, and one to the impious; to the good and to the bad; and to the clean and to the unclean; and to the one sacrificing and to the one not sacrificing; as is the good, as is the one sinning; as the one swearing by an oath, as is the one [2the 3oath 1fearing].

3. This evil is in all being done under the sun, for there is [2event 1one]  to all. And indeed the heart of the sons  of man are filled with evil; and madness in their heart during their life, and after them they go to the dead.

4. For someone who participates with all the living there is hope; for the [2dog  1living] himself is good over the [2lion  1dead].

5. For the living shall know that they shall die; but the dead are not knowing anything; and there is not [2to them 3any longer 1a wage], for [2was forgotten  1their remembrance].

6. And indeed their love, and indeed their hatred, and indeed their zeal already perished; and [2portion 1there is no] to them any longer into the eon, in all things  being done under the sun.

7. Come, eat with gladness  of your bread, and drink [2with 4heart 3a good 1your wine]! for already God thought well  of your actions

8. In every time let [2be 1your garments] white, and [2oil 4upon 5your head 1let not 3be lacking]!

9. And behold life with the wife which you loved all the days of the life of your folly! the ones being given to you under the sun, all the days of the life of your folly. For it is your portion in  your life, and in  your effort wherein you made an effort under the sun.

10. All as much as [2should find  1your hand]  to do, [2as 3is 5power 4in your 1you do]; for there is no action, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in Hades, of where you should go there.

11. I turned, and I beheld under the sun, that not to the light of foot is the race; and not to the mighty ones  in battle; and indeed not to the wise is the bread; and indeed not to the discerning ones is the riches; and indeed not to the ones knowing favor; for a season and a meeting shall meet with them all.

12. And indeed [2does not know  1man]  his season. As  fishes  being hunted with [2casting-net 1a hurtful], and as birds  being hunted with a snare -- as them [4shall be ensnared 1the 2sons  3of man] in [2season 1an evil], whenever it should fall upon them suddenly.

13. And indeed this I beheld -- wisdom under the sun, and it is great to me.

14. [2city 1If there were a small], and the men in it few; and there should come against it [2king 1a great], and he shall encircle it, and shall build against it [2siege mounds 1great];

15. and there should be found in it [3man 1a needy 2wise]; and [2shall deliver 1he himself] the city in  his wisdom; but man remembered not with  [3man  2needy 1that].

16. And I said, [2is good 1Wisdom] over power. But the wisdom of the needy man is being treated with contempt, and his words are not being listened to.

17. Words of the wise being at rest are heard above a cry of ones being in authority in follies.

18. [2is good 1Wisdom] over weapons of war; but [2sinning 1one] shall destroy [2goodness 1much].  

## Ecclesiastes 10

1.  The Ways of the Wise and Foolish A fly put to death will rot a concoction [2oil 1of lucious]; [3is valuable 1A little 2wisdom] over [2glory 3of folly 1great].

2. A heart of a wise man is at his right hand; and the heart of a fool is at his left.

3. And indeed [4in the way 1whenever 2a fool 3goes] of his heart, he will fail, and [2which he considers 1all] is folly.

4. If spirit of the one exercising authority should ascend against you, [3your place 1you should not 2leave]; for a cure will put to rest [2sins 1great].

5. There is a wickedness which I beheld under the sun, as an unintentional act came forth from the person of one exercising authority.

6. [3was put 1The 2fool] in [2heights 1great], and the rich [2in 3low 1shall settle].

7. I beheld servants upon horses, and rulers going as servants upon the ground.

8. The one digging a cesspool [2into 3it 1shall fall]; and the one demolishing a fence boundary, [2shall bite 3him 1a serpent].

9. One lifting away stones shall work hard among them; one splitting wood shall be exposed to danger in them.

10. If [2should fall off  1an iron implement], and he [2in countenance 1is disturbed], then [2his power 1he shall strengthen], and abundance is to the man of which is wisdom.

11. If [3should bite 1the 2serpent] with no enchanter whispering, then there is no advantage to the one charming.

12. The words [2mouth 1of a wise] carry favor; but the lips of a fool shall sink him;

13. the beginning of the words of his mouth are folly, and the end of his mouth [2madness 1is wicked].

14. And the fool multiplies words. [2does not 3know  1Man] what the thing becoming is, and what the thing will be; for after him who shall announce to him?

15. The effort of the fools shall trouble them as one who does not know how  to go into the city.

16. Woe to you, O city, of which  your king is younger, and  your rulers [2in 3the morning 1eat].

17. Blessed is your land of which  your king is a son of free nobles, and  your rulers at a proper time shall eat in force, and shall not be ashamed.

18. By slothful neglect [2will be lowered  1a building]; and in idleness of hands [3will drip 1the 2house].

19. For laughter they make bread, and wine and olive oil  [2to be glad 1for the living]; and of the money all will heed.

20. And indeed in your conscience [2a king 1you should not curse]; and in the closets of your bedrooms you should not curse a rich man. For a winged creature  of heaven shall carry  your voice, and the one having the wings shall report your word.  

## Ecclesiastes 11

1.  The Ways of Equity Send  your bread upon the face of the water! for in a multitude  of days you will find it.

2. Give a portion  to seven, even indeed  to eight! for you do not know what evil there will be upon the earth.

3. If [3should be filled 1the 2clouds] of rain, [2upon 3the 4earth 1they pour out]; and if [2should fall 1a tree] towards the south, or if towards the north, in the place where [3shall fall 1the 2tree] there it shall be.

4. Giving heed to the wind one does not sow, and one looking into the clouds will not harvest.

5. Among the ones in whom there is no knowing what the way of the wind is, as the bones in the womb  of one being with child, so you shall not know the actions  of God, as much as he shall do  in all things.

6. At morning sow  your seed, and at evening do not relieve  your hand! for you do not know what will line up --  this here,  this there, or if the two [2together 1are good].

7. Moreover [2is sweet  1the light], and it is good to the eyes  to see with the sun.

8. For even if [4years 3many 2shall live  1a man], in all them he shall be glad. And [4shall be remembered 1the 2days  3of darkness], for they will be many. All  coming is folly.

9. Be glad, O young man, in your youth! and let [2do you good  1your heart] in the days of your youth! And walk in the ways of your heart unblemished, and in the vision of your eyes! And know that in all these [2shall lead 3you  1God] in equity!

10. And leave rage from your heart, and pass off wickedness from your flesh! for  youth and  thoughtlessness are folly.  

## Ecclesiastes 12

1.  The End of the Whole Matter And remember the one creating you in the days of your youth! while [4should not 5come 1the 2days  3of evil], nor [2should arrive 1years], in which you shall then say, There is not in me [2for 3them 1a want].

2. While [6are not darkened 1the 2sun 3and 4the 5light], nor the moon and the stars; nor [3return 1the 2clouds] after the rain;

3. in a day in which ever [4should be shaken 1the keepers 2of the 3house], and [3should be turned aside 1men  2of power], and [3are idle 1the 2grinding women] because they are made few, and [6shall darken 1the 2women looking 3out of 4the 5openings];

4. and they shall lock the doors in the market in weakness of the sound of the woman grinding, and one shall rise up to the sound of the sparrow, and [5shall be humbled 1all 2the 3daughters  4of song];

5. and indeed from the height they shall see, even stupefactions in the way; and [3shall bloom 1the 2almond], and [3shall thicken 1the 2locust], and [3shall be dispersed 1the 2caper]; because [2went  1man] to [2house 1his eternal]; and [3circled 4in 5the market 1the ones 2beating their chests in mourning];

6. until whenever should be prostrated the line  of silver; and [4should be broken 1the 2flower ornament  3of gold], and [3should be broken 1the 2water-pitcher] at the spring, and [3should have rolled 1the 2wheel] unto the pit;

7. then [3shall return 1the 2dust] upon the earth as it was; and the spirit should return to the God who gave it.

8. Folly of follies, said the ecclesiastic,  all things are folly.

9. And it was extra that [2became 1the ecclesiastic] wise, and he taught knowledge with  man, and which he shall trace composed parables.

10. [3much 2sought 1The ecclesiastic]  to find [2of words 1a wanting], and writing of uprightness of words of truth.

11. The words of the wise are as the oxgoads, and as nails firmly planted; ones which by  agreement were given from [2shepherd 1one].

12. And [3extra 4by 5them 1O my son 2guard]!  To make [2scrolls 1many] there is no limit; and [2meditation 1much] is weariness of flesh.

13. The end of the whole matter, hear!  Fear God, and  [2his commandments 1keep]! for this is all man!

14. For every  action  God shall lead into judgment, with all being looked over, if good and if evil.
