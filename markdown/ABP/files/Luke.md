# Luke

## Luke 1

1.  To Theophilus Seeing that many attempted to arrange a narrative concerning the [2having a full assurance 3among 4us 1things],

2. as was delivered up to us by the ones from the beginning [2eyewitnesses 3and 4assistants 1having been] of the word,

3. it seemed good that I also, having followed closely from the beginning in all things exactly, [2in order 1write to you], most excellent Theophilus,

4. that you should realize concerning [3of which 5you were instructed 4matters 1the 2certainty]. 

5.  Zacharias and Elizabeth It came to pass in the days of Herod the king  of Judea, with a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the daily rotations of Abia; and  his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and  her name was Elizabeth.

6. And they were [2righteous 1both] before  God, going in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

7. And there was no child to them, in so far as  Elizabeth was sterile, and both [2advancing 3in  4their days 1were].

8. And it came to pass in  his officiating as priest in the order  of his daily rotations before  God,

9. according to the custom of the priesthood, he obtained by lot  to burn incense when entering into the temple of the Lord.

10. And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour  of incense.

11. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing at the right of the altar  of incense.

12. And Zacharias was disturbed seeing him, and fear fell upon him.

13. [4said 1And 5to 6him 2the 3angel], Fear not, Zacharias! because [2was heard  1your supplication], and  your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son to you, and you shall call  his name John.

14. And he will be a joy to you and exultation; and many [2at  3his nativity 1shall rejoice].

15. For he will be great before the Lord, and wine and liquor in no way shall he drink; and [3spirit 2of holy 1he shall be filled] still from [2belly 1his mother's].

16. And [2many 3of the 4sons 5of Israel 1he will turn] to the Lord  their God.

17. And he shall go forth before him in spirit and power of Elijah, to turn hearts of fathers unto children, and ones resisting persuasion to the intelligence of the righteous; to prepare for the Lord a people being carefully prepared.

18. And Zacharias said to the angel, By what thing shall I know this, for I am an old man, and  my wife is advanced in  her days?

19. And answering the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, the one standing in the presence  of God, and I was sent to speak to you, and to announce good news to you of these things.

20. And behold, you will be kept silent, and not being able to speak till of which day these things take place, because you believed not  my words, the ones which shall be fulfilled in  their time.

21. And [3were 1the 2people] expecting  Zacharias, and they wondered at  his passing time in the temple.

22. And having come forth, he was not able to speak to them. And they realized that [2an apparition 1he has seen] in the temple. And he was signifying with his head to them, and he remained mute.

23. And it came to pass as [3were filled 1the 2days]  of his ministration, he went forth unto  his house.

24. And after these  days [3conceived 1Elizabeth  2his wife], and she covered round about and concealed herself [2months 1five], saying that,

25. Thus [3has done to me 1the 2Lord] in the days in which he looked upon to remove  my scorn among men. 

26.  An Angel Appears unto Mary And in the [2month  1sixth 6was sent 3the 4angel 5Gabriel] by  God unto a city  of Galilee, with the name Nazareth,

27. to a virgin being espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, from the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.

28. And [3entering 1the 2angel] to her, said, Hail! one being shown favor. The Lord is with you, O you being blessed among women.

29.  And she, seeing, was disturbed over  his word, and reasoned what [2may be  1this greeting].

30. And [3said 1the 2angel] to her, Fear not Mary! for you found favor with  God.

31. And behold, you shall conceive in the womb, and you shall give birth to a son, and you shall call  his name Jesus.

32. This one will be great, and [2son 3of highest 1he will be called]; and [3shall give 4to him 1the Lord  2God] the throne of David  his father.

33. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob into the eons, and  of his kingdom there shall not be an end.

34. [3said 1And 2Mary] to the angel, How will this be, since [2a husband 1I know not]?

35. And answering the angel said to her, [2spirit 1Holy] shall come upon you, and power of the highest shall overshadow you; therefore also the one being born of you holy, shall be called Son of God.

36. And behold, Elizabeth  your relative, even she is having conceived a son in her old age, and this one [6month 5sixth 3is 4in her  1being called 2sterile].

37. For not shall [3be impossible 4with  5God 1any 2thing].

38. [3said 1And 2Mary], Behold, the maidservant of the Lord; may it be to me according to  your word. And [3went forth 4from 5her 1the 2angel]. 

39.  Mary Visits Elizabeth [3rising up 1And 2Mary] in  these days, went into the mountainous area with haste, unto a city of Judah.

40. And she entered into the house of Zacharias, and she greeted  Elizabeth.

41. And it came to pass as Elizabeth heard the greeting  of Mary, [3leaped 1the 2babe] in  her belly. And [2was filled 4spirit 3of holy  1Elizabeth].

42. And she sounded out loud [2voice 1with a great] and said, O you being blessed among women, and being blessed is the fruit  of your belly.

43. And from where is this to me, that [4should come 1the 2mother  3of my Lord] to me?

44. For behold, as [4took place 1the 2sound  3of your greeting] in  my ears, [3leaped 4in 5exultation 1the 2babe] in  my belly.

45. And blessed is the one believing, for there will be a perfection to the things spoken to her by the Lord. 

46.  Mary Magnifies the Lord And Mary said, [3magnifies  2soul 1My] the Lord,

47. and [2exults  1my spirit] over  God  my deliverer.

48. For he looked upon the low estate  of his maidservant. For behold, from the present [3shall declare me blessed 1all  2generations].

49. For [3did 4a magnificent thing to me 1the 2mighty one], and holy  is his name.

50. And  his mercy is for generations of generations to the ones fearing him.

51. He executed might with his arm; he dispersed proud ones -- the thought of their hearts.

52. He demolished mighty ones from thrones, and raised up high humble ones.

53. [2ones being hungry 1He filled up] of good things, and ones being rich he sent out empty.

54. He took hold of Israel his servant, [2to be remembered 1for mercy],

55. (as he said to  our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed), into the eon.

56. [3abided 1And 2Mary] with her about [2months 1three]; and she returned unto  her house. 

57.  The Birth of John the Baptist  And Elizabeth fulfilled the time of her giving birth; and she bore a son.

58. And [3heard 1the ones 2adjacent], and  her relatives, that the Lord magnified  his mercy with her; and they rejoiced along with her.

59. And it came to pass in the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they called it after the name  of his father Zacharias.

60. And answering  his mother said, No, but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her that, No one is among  your kin who is called by this name.

62. And they beckoned to his father, for the name that he might want to call him.

63. And asking for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is  his name. And they all marveled.

64. [3was opened 1And  2his mouth] immediately, and  his tongue, and he spoke blessing  God.

65. And [2came 3upon 4all 1fear] the ones living about them. And in the entire  mountainous area  of Judea [3were discussed 1all  2these matters].

66. And [4placed them 1all 2the ones 3having heard] in  their heart, saying, What then  [2this child 1will] be? And the hand of the Lord was with him. 

67.  The Prophecy of Zacharias And Zacharias  his father was filled [2spirit 1of holy], and prophesied, saying,

68. Blessed is the Lord  God  of Israel, for he visited and made a ransoming to his people;

69. and he raised a horn of deliverance to us by the house of David  his servant;

70. as he spoke by the mouth of the holy ones, of the ones from the eon, his prophets --

71. deliverance from our enemies, and from the hand of all of the ones detesting us;

72. to do mercy with  our fathers, and to remember [3covenant 2holy 1his];

73. the oath which he swore to Abraham  our father  to grant to us;

74. [7fearlessly 2from out of 3the hand  4of our enemies 1being rescued 5to serve 6him];

75. in sacredness and righteousness before him all the days  of our life.

76. And you, child, [2prophet 3of highest 1shall be called]; for you shall go forth before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

77.  to give knowledge of deliverance to his people in a release of their sins;

78. through feelings of compassion of mercy of our God, in which [4visited 5us 1the rising 2of 3the height];

79. to shine unto the ones in darkness and [2in the shadow 3of death 1sitting];  to straighten out  our feet unto the way of peace.

80. And the child grew, and was fortified in spirit, and was in the wildernesses until the day of his appointment with  Israel.  

## Luke 2

1.  Jesus Born in Bethlehem And it came to pass in  those days, went forth a decree by Caesar Augustus to register all the habitable world.

2. This  census first took place [2governing  3Syria 1of Cyrenius].

3. And all went forth to register each unto  his own city.

4. [4ascended 1And 3also 2Joseph] from  Galilee, from out of the city of Nazareth into  Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, (on account of  his being from the house and family of David),

5. to be registered with Mary, to the one being espoused to him as wife, being pregnant.

6. And it came to pass in  their being there, [3were fulfilled 1the 2days] of her to give birth.

7. And she gave birth to  her son the first-born, and she swaddled him, and laid him in the stable, because there was no place for them in the lodging.

8. And shepherds were in the same place living outdoors and keeping watches at night over  their flock.

9. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and glory of the Lord shone about them, and they feared [2fear 1a great].

10. And [3said 4to them 1the 2angel], Fear not! for behold I announce to you good news -- [2joy 1great] which shall be to all  people.

11. For was born to you today a deliverer who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.

12. And this [3to you 1is the 2sign]; you shall find the babe being swaddled, lying in a stable.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude [2military 1of heavenly] praising  God, and saying,

14. Glory in the highest to God, and upon earth peace, among men with benevolence.

15. And it came to pass as [3went forth 4from 5them 6into 7the 8heaven 1the 2angels], that the men, the shepherds said to one another, We should go indeed unto Bethlehem, and behold  this thing  taking place, which the Lord made known to us.

16. And they came having hastened, and discovered  both Mary and  Joseph, and the babe lying in the stable.

17. And beholding, they made known concerning the thing  being spoken to them concerning  this child.

18. And all the ones having heard wondered concerning the things being spoken by the shepherds to them.

19.  But Mary preserved all  these things, uniting them in  her heart.

20. And [3returned 1the 2shepherds], glorifying and praising  God for all which they heard and beheld, as it was told to them. 

21.  The Circumcision of Jesus And when [3were fulfilled 2days 1eight]  to circumcise the child, that [2was called  1his name] Jesus, the one being called by the angel before  his being conceived in the belly.

22. And when [3were fulfilled 1the 2days]  of her cleansing, according to the law of Moses, they led him unto Jerusalem to render to the Lord,

23. (as it has been written in the law of the Lord that, Every male opening wide the womb [2holy 3to the 4Lord 1shall be called];)

24. and  to give a sacrifice according to the thing being said in the law of the Lord -- a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons. 

25.  Simeon And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and  this man was just and reverent, waiting for the consolation  of Israel; and [2spirit 1holy] was upon him.

26. And there was to him a receiving of a divine message by the [2spirit  1holy] to not see death before he should behold the Christ of the Lord.

27. And he came in the spirit into the temple. And in the bringing [4by the 5parents 1the 2child 3Jesus],  for them to do according to the thing accustomed by the law for him,

28. that he received it into  his embrace, and he blessed  God, and said,

29. Now loosen  your servant, O master, according to  your word, in peace.

30. For [2saw  1my eyes]  your deliverance,

31. which you prepared before the face of all the peoples;

32. a light for an uncovering of nations, and glory of your people Israel.

33. And [2was 1Joseph 4and  5his mother 3marveling] over the things being spoken concerning him.

34. And [2blessed 3them 1Simeon], and said to Mary  his mother, Behold, this one is situated for a downfall and a rising up of many in  Israel, and for a sign being disputed;

35. ([2even 3you 1and], [3your  4soul 2shall go through 1a broadsword],) so that [4should be 5uncovered  2of many 3hearts 1the thoughts]. 

36.  Anna And there was Anna a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher; she was advanced in [2days 1many], having lived [2years 3with 4a husband 1seven] from  her virginity,

37. and she was a widow about [2years 1eighty-four], who did not leave from the temple; with fastings and supplications serving night and day.

38. And she, the same  hour standing by, confessed to the Lord, and spoke concerning him to all the ones waiting for a ransoming in Jerusalem.

39. And as they finished all together the things according to the law of the Lord, they returned unto  Galilee, unto  their own city Nazareth. 

40.  The Child Jesus in the Temple And the child grew and was fortified in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and favor of God was upon it.

41. And [2went  1his parents] each year unto Jerusalem to the holiday of the passover.

42. And when he was [2years old 1twelve], of their ascending unto Jerusalem according to the custom of the holiday,

43. and having finished the days, in  their returning, [4remained behind 3Jesus 1the 2child] in Jerusalem; and [4did not 5know 1Joseph 2and  3his mother].

44. But thinking him [2in 3the 4group 1to be], they came a day's journey; and they searched him out among the relatives and among the acquaintances.

45. And not finding him, they returned unto Jerusalem seeking him.

46. And it came to pass after [2days 1three] they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and questioning them.

47. [6were amazed 1And 2all 3the ones 4hearing 5him] by the understanding and  his answers.

48. And seeing him, they were overwhelmed. And [3to 4him  1his mother 2said], Child, why did you so to us? Behold,  your father and I were grieving seeking you.

49. And he said to them, Why is it that you seek me, do you not know that [3among 4the things  5of my father 1it is necessary 2for me to be]?

50. And they did not perceive the saying which he spoke to them.

51. And he went down with them and came into Nazareth, and he was being submitted to them. And  his mother kept carefully all  these sayings in  her heart.

52. And Jesus progressed in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.  

## Luke 3

1.  John the Baptist in the Wilderness [2in 4year 1And 3the fifteenth] of the governing of Tiberius Caesar, and the governing of Pontius Pilate of the Jews, and [2being tetrarch  3of Galilee 1Herod], and Philip  his brother being tetrarch  of Iturea and Trachonitis the region, and Lysanias  being tetrarch of Abilene,

2. with chief priests Annas and Caiaphas, came the word of God unto John the  son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3. And he went into all the place round about the Jordan proclaiming an immersion of repentance for a release of sins;

4. as it has been written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, A voice yelling in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord! [2straight 1Make]  his roads!

5. Every ravine shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be lowered; and [3will be 1the 2crooked] for straight, and the rough for [2ways 1smooth];

6. and [3shall see 1all 2flesh] the deliverance  of God.

7. He said then to the [2coming forth 1multitudes] to be immersed by him, Offspring of vipers, who indicated to you to flee from the [2about to be 1wrath]?

8. Do then fruits worthy of the repentance! For you should not begin to say among yourselves, [2father 1We have]  Abraham; for I say to you, that God is able from out of  these stones to raise children to Abraham.

9. But already even the axe [2at 3the 4root 5of the 6trees 1is situated]. Every tree then not producing [2fruit 1good] is cut down, and [2into 3the fire 1thrown].

10. And [3asked 4him 1the 2multitudes], saying, What then shall we do?

11. And answering he says to them, The one having two inner garments, share with the one not having! And the one having foods, in like manner do!

12. And there came also tax collectors to be immersed, and they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?

13. And he said to them, [2nothing 3more 4beyond 5that 6being set in order 7to you 1exact]!

14. [3asked 1And 4him 5also 2soldiers], saying, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, No one should you shake up nor extort, and let [2be sufficient  1your rations]!

15. [4were expecting 1And 2the 3people], and all were reasoning in  their hearts concerning  John, if perhaps he may be the Christ.

16. John answered all together, saying, I indeed [3in water 1immerse 2you], but comes the one stronger than me, of whom I am not fit to untie the strap  of his sandals; he will immerse you in [2spirit 1holy] and in fire;

17. of whom the winnowing fan is in  his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse  his threshing-floor; and he will gather the grain into  his storehouse; and the straw he will incinerate with [2fire 1inextinguishable].

18. [4many 2indeed 3then 1And] other things comforting he announced good news to the people. 

19.  The Immersion of Jesus  But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias the wife  of his brother Philip, and concerning all [2which 4did 1the evils  3Herod],

20. added also this unto all -- that he imprisoned  John in the prison.

21. And it came to pass in the immersing all the people, and Jesus being immersed and praying, [3was opened 1the 2heaven],

22. and [4came down 1the 3spirit  2holy] bodily in a form as a dove upon him, and a voice out of heaven came, saying, You are  my son the beloved; in you I take pleasure. 

23.  The Genealogy of Jesus And [2himself 3was  1Jesus 4about 6years old 5thirty] in beginning, being as was thought the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,

## Luke 4

1.  Jesus is Tested by the Devil And Jesus [3spirit 2of holy 1full] returned from the Jordan; and he was led by the spirit into the wilderness,

2. [2days 1forty] being tested by the devil. And he did not eat anything during  [2days 1those]. And with their being completed, afterwards he hungered.

3. And [3said 4to him 1the 2devil], If you are Son  of God, tell  this stone that it become bread!

4. And Jesus answered to him, saying, It has been written that, Not by bread alone shall [2live 1man], but by every word of God.

5. And [3led 4him 1the 2devil] into [2mountain 1a high], to show to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And [3said 4to him 1the 2devil], I shall give to you  this authority all together, and  their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and to whom ever I should want to give it.

7. You then, if you should do obeisance before me, [2will be 3yours 1all].

8. And answering to him Jesus said, Go behind me Satan! for it has been written, You shall do obeisance to the Lord  your God, and to him alone shall you serve.

9. And he led him unto Jerusalem, and stood him upon the border of the temple, and said to him, If [2the 3son 1you are]  of God, throw yourself from here below!

10. For it has been written that, To his angels he shall give charge concerning you,  to guard you;

11. and upon hands they shall lift you, lest at any time [2should stumble 3against 4a stone  1your foot].

12. And answering [2said 3to him  1Jesus] that, It has been said, Do not put to test the Lord  your God!

13. And [3having completed 4all 5the test 1the 2devil], left from him until an occasion. 

14.  Jesus Begins His Ministry And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into  Galilee; and a reputation went forth unto the entire  place round about concerning him.

15. And he taught in  their synagogues, being extolled by all.

16. And he came unto  Nazareth, of which he was reared. And he entered (according to the thing accustomed for him in the day of the Sabbaths) into the synagogue, and he rose up to read.

17. And there was given over to him a scroll of Isaiah the prophet. And unrolling the scroll, he found the place of which it was having been written,

18. Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because of which he anointed me to announce good news to the poor; he has sent me to heal the ones being broken  in heart, to proclaim to captives a release, and to blind a recovery of sight, to send [2to the ones being devastated  1a release];

19. to proclaim [2year 3of the Lord 1the accepted].

20. And having rolled up the scroll, having given it back to the assistant, he sat down. And all [2in 3the 4synagogue  1eyes] were gazing upon him.

21. And he began to say to them that, Today [2has been fulfilled  1this scripture] in  your ears.

22. And all bore witness to him, and marveled over the words  of favor, the ones going forth from out of  his mouth. And they said, [2not 3this 1Is] the son of Joseph?

23. And he said to them, Assuredly you shall say to me  this parable, Physician attend to yourself! As many things as we heard taking place in  Capernaum, do also here in  your fatherland!

24. And he said, Amen I say to you that, Not one prophet is accepted in  his fatherland.

25. [2in 3truth 1And] I say to you, [2many 3widows 1There were] in the days of Elijah in  Israel, when [3was locked 1the 2heaven] for [2years 1three] and [2months 1six], as [3took place 2famine 1a great] upon all the land.

26. And to not one of them was Elijah sent, except unto Sarepta  of Sidon, to [2woman 1a widow].

27. And [2many 3lepers 1there were] in the time of Elisha the prophet in  Israel, and not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.

28. And they were all filled with rage in the synagogue, hearing these things.

29. And having risen up, they cast him outside the city, and led him unto a brow of the mountain upon which  their city had been built, so as to fling him downwards.

30. But he going through the midst of them went away.

31. And he went down unto Capernaum, a city  of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths.

32. And they were overwhelmed at  his teaching, for [3with 4authority 2was  1his word]. 

33.  The Unclean Spirits Come Forth And in the synagogue was a man having a spirit [2demon 1of an unclean], and he shouted aloud [2voice 1with a great],

34. saying, Alas, what is it to us and to you, Jesus -- Nazarene? Are you come to destroy us? I know you, who you are, the holy one  of God.

35. And [2reproached 3him  1Jesus], saying, Be halted, and come forth from him! And [3having tossed 4him 1the 2demon] into the midst, came forth from him, in nothing having hurt him.

36. And there became a stupefaction upon all, and they conversed together with one another, saying, What  word is this, that with authority and power he gives orders to the unclean spirits, and they come forth?

37. And [4went forth 1the sound 2concerning 3him] unto every place  round about. 

38.  Jesus Heals Many And rising up from out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon. [2the 3mother-in-law 1And]  of Simon was constrained [2fever 1by a great]; and they asked him concerning her.

39. And standing above her, he reproached the fever; and it left her. And immediately rising up she served to them.

40. And at the going down of the sun, all as many as had ones being weak [2diseases 1by various] led them to him;  and [6one 5each 7of them 2the 3hands 1having placed 4upon], he cured them.

41. And there came forth also demons from many, crying out and saying that, You are the Christ the son  of God. And reproaching, he did not allow them to speak; for they knew [3the 4Christ 1him 2to be].

42. And becoming day, having come forth, he went into a desolate place. And the multitudes sought him, and came unto him, and constrained him  to not go from them.

43. And he said to them that, Also to the other cities [2to announce good news 1it is necessary for me] -- the kingdom  of God. For in this I have been sent.

44. And he was proclaiming in the synagogues of the of Galilee.  

## Luke 5

1.  Jesus at the Lake of Gennesaret And it came to pass in the time the multitude pressed upon him  to hear the word  of God, and he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,

2. and he saw two boats standing by the lake; and the fishermen having disembarked from them were washing the nets.

3. And having stepped into one of the boats, which was  Simon's, he asked him [3from 4the 5land 1to turn back 2a little]. And having sat down he taught [3from out of 4the 5boat 1the 2multitudes]. 

4.  The Miracle of the Catch And as he ceased speaking, he said to  Simon, Turn back into the depth, and let down  your nets for a catch!

5. And responding  Simon said to him, Master, through the entire  night having tired [2nothing 1we took], but on  your word I will let down the net.

6. And this having done, they closed up a multitude [2fishes 1of great]; [3was being torn 1and  2their net].

7. And they nodded to their partners, to the ones in the other boat,  to come seize them; and they came and filled both the boats, so that they were submerged.

8. And beholding, Simon Peter fell at the knees  of Jesus, saying, Go forth from me, for [2a man 3a sinner 1I am], O Lord.

9. For a stupefaction compassed him, and all the ones with him, over the catch of the fishes which they seized;

10. and likewise also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, the ones who were partners with Simon. And [2said 3to  4Simon  1Jesus], Fear not! from  now on [3men 1you will be 2taking alive]!

11. And leading the boats unto the land, leaving all, they followed him. 

12.  Jesus Heals the Leper And it came to pass in  his being in one of the cities, and behold -- a man full of leprosy. And seeing  Jesus, falling upon his face, he beseeched him, saying, O Lord, if you should want, you are able to cleanse me.

13. And having stretched out the hand, he touched him, saying, I want, be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy went forth from him.

14. And he exhorted him [2no one 1to tell]; but said, Having gone forth show yourself to the priest, and offer concerning  your cleansing as Moses assigned for a testimony to them!

15. [4went through 1And 5more 2the 3word] concerning him. And [3gathered together 2multitudes 1many] to hear, and to be cured by him of  their sicknesses.

16. And he was retreating in the wildernesses, and praying.

17. And it came to pass on one of the days, and he was teaching, and there were sitting down Pharisees and teachers of the law, the ones who were coming from out of every town  of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem. And power of the Lord was there for  them to be healed.

18. And behold, men were bringing upon a bed a man who was disabled, and they sought to carry him in, and to put him in front of him.

19. And not having found by what means they should carry him in through the multitude, having ascending upon the roof, [3through 4the 5ceramic tiles 1they lowered 2him] with the cot into the midst before  Jesus. 

20.  Jesus Forgives Sins And beholding  their belief, he said to him, O man, [2are forgiven 3you  1your sins].

21. And [6began 7to reason 1the 2scribes 3and 4the 5Pharisees], saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemy? Who is able to forgive sins, except God alone?

22. [3recognizing 1And  2Jesus]  their thoughts, responding said to them, Why do you reason in  your hearts?

23. What is easier to say? [2are forgiven 3to you  1Your sins]; or to say, Arise and walk!

24. But that you should know that [5authority 4has 1the 2son  3of man] upon the earth to forgive sins, he said to the disabled man, To you I say, Arise, and take  your cot, go unto  your house!

25. And immediately, having risen before them, and having lifted that upon which he reclined, he went forth unto  his house glorifying  God.

26. And astonishment took all, and they glorified  God, and were filled of fear, saying that, We beheld an incredible thing today. 

27.  Levi the Tax Collector And after these things he went forth, and he saw a tax collector, by name Levi, sitting down at the tax collector's station. And he said to him, Follow me!

28. And leaving behind all, having risen, he followed him.

29. And [2made 4banquet 3a great 1Levi] for him in  his house. And was there [2multitude 3of tax collectors 1a great], and others who were with them reclining.

30. And [5grumbled  1their scribes 2and 3the 4Pharisees] against  his disciples, saying, Why with the tax collectors and sinners does he eat and drink?

31. And answering  Jesus said to them, No need [3have 1do the ones 2being in health] of a physician, but the ones [2illnesses 1having].

32. I have not come to call righteous ones but sinners unto repentance. 

33.  Jesus Questioned About Fasting And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast frequently, and [2supplications 1make], and in like manner the ones of the Pharisees, but the ones to you eat and drink?

34. And he said to them, Are you able [2the 3sons 4of the 5bridal chamber 7when 8the 9groom 11with 12them 10is 1to make 6fast]?

35. But there will come days, that whenever [3departs 4from 5them 1the 2groom], then they shall fast in those  days.

36. And he spoke also a parable to them that, No one [2a piece of cloth 4coat 3of a new 1puts] upon [2cloak 1an old]; otherwise also the new splits, and the old cloak does not join in harmony with the one of the new.

37. And no one casts [2wine 1new] into [2leather wine bags 1old]; otherwise [4shall tear 1the 2new 3wine] the leather wine bags, and it will be poured out, and the leather wine bags will be destroyed.

38. But [2wine 1new 4into 6leather wine bags 5new 3is put], and both are preserved together.

39. And no one having drunk old wine immediately wants new; for he says the old is better.  

## Luke 6

1.  Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath And it came to pass on Sabbath following the great one, he traveled through the corn-fields; and [2were plucking  1his disciples] the ears of corn and were eating them by rubbing in pieces with their hands.

2. And some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do what is not allowed to do on the Sabbaths?

3. And answering to them Jesus said, Neither this did you read, what David did, when he hungered himself and the ones [2with 3him 1being]?

4. How he entered into the house  of God, and the bread loaves of the place setting he took, and he ate, and he gave also to the ones with him, which is not allowed to be eaten except [3only 1the 2priests]?

5. And he said to them that, [4is Lord 1The 2son  3of man] also of the Sabbath. 

6.  Jesus Heals on the Sabbath And it came to pass also on another Sabbath for him to enter into the synagogue and to teach. And there was there a man, and  [3hand 1his  2right] was withered.

7. And they closely watched him -- the scribes and the Pharisees, to see if [3on 4the 5Sabbath 1he will cure 2him], that they should find a charge against him.

8. But he knew  their thoughts, and he said to the man, to the one [3withered 1having 2the] hand, Arise, and stand in the midst! And he having risen up stood.

9. Then said  Jesus to them, I will ask you, What is allowed to the Sabbaths -- to do good or to do evil? [2a soul 1to preserve] or to destroy?

10. And having looked round about on all of them, he said to the man, Stretch out  your hand! And he did thus. And [2was restored  1his hand] in health as the other.

11. But they were filled with thoughtlessness; and they discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus. 

12.  Jesus Chooses the Twelve Disciples And it came to pass in  those days, he went forth into the mountain to pray; and he was spending the night in the prayer  of God.

13. And when it became day, he called out to  his disciples, even choosing from them twelve, whom also [2apostles 1he named] --

14. Simon, whom also he named Peter, and Andrew  his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the one being called Zealot,

16. Judas of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also became the betrayer. 

17.  Jesus Heals Many And going down with them, he stopped at [2place 1a flat], and a multitude of his disciples, and [2multitude 1a great] of the people from all  Judea, and Jerusalem, and of the coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of  their diseases,

18. and the ones being mobbed by [2spirits 1unclean]; and they were being cured.

19. And all the multitude sought to touch him, for power by him came forth and healed all. 

20.  Blessings and Woes And he, lifting up  his eyes unto  his disciples, said, Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom  of God.

21. Blessed are the ones hungering now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are the ones weeping now, for you shall laugh.

22. Blessed are you whenever [2should detest 3you  1men], and whenever they should separate you, and should berate you, and should cast out  your name as wicked, because of the son  of man.

23. Rejoice in that  day, and leap! for behold  your wage is great in the heaven. [2according to 3these things 1For 5did 6to the 7prophets  4their fathers].

24. Furthermore, woe to you, to the rich, for you receive  your comfort.

25. Woe to you, the ones being filled up, for you shall hunger. Woe to you, the ones laughing now, for you shall mourn and weep.

26. Woe whenever [4well 5of you 3should speak 1the 2men], [2according to 3these things 1for 5did 6to the 7false prophets  4their fathers]. 

27.  Jesus Teaches on Love But to you I say, to the ones hearing, Love  your enemies! [2well 1Do] to the ones detesting you!

28. Bless the ones cursing you! And pray for the ones threatening you!

29. To the one beating you upon the jaw, furnish also the other! And from the one taking away your  cloak, also the inner garment you should not restrain.

30. And to every one  asking you, give! And from the one taking away your things, do not exact payment!

31. And as you want that [2should do 3to you  1men], you also do to them in like manner!

32. And if you love the ones loving you, what [3to you 1favor 2is it]? for even the sinners [2the ones 3loving 4them 1love].

33. And if you should do good for the ones doing you good, what [3to you 1favor 2is it]? for even the sinners [2the 3same 1do].

34. And if you should lend from whom you hope to recover, what [3to you 1favor 2is it]? for even sinners [2to sinners 1lend], that they should recover what is equal.

35. Furthermore, love  your enemies, and do good, and lend [2nothing 1despairing for]! and [2will be  1your wage] great, and you will be sons of the highest. For he is gracious upon the ungracious and wicked.

36. You become then pitying, as also  your father is pitying!

37. And judge not! and in no way should you be judged. Condemn not! and in no way should you be condemned. Dismiss! and you will be dismissed.

38. Give! and it shall be given to you! [2measure 1In good], being compressed and shaken and overrunning, shall they give unto  your bosom. For the same measure which you measure, it will be measured back to you.

39. And he spoke a parable to them, In anything is [2able 1the blind] [2the blind 1to guide]? Shall not both [2into 3a cistern 1fall]?

40. [2is not 1A disciple] above  his teacher; but by fashion every one will be as  his teacher.

41. But why do you see the speck, the one in the eye  of your brother, but the beam, the one in  your own eye you do not mind?

42. Or how are you able to say to your brother, O brother, allow me to cast out the speck, the one in  your eye, and yourself [3the 5in  6your eye 4beam 1are not 2seeing]? Hypocrite, cast out first the beam from  your eye, and then you shall see clearly to cast out the speck, the one in the eye  of your brother!

43. [3not 1For 2there is 5tree 4a good] producing [2fruit 1rotten]; nor [2tree 1a rotten] producing [2fruit 1good].

44. For each tree from  its own fruit is known. For not from thorn-bushes do they collect figs, nor from a bush do they gather the vintage grape.

45. The good man from out of the good treasure  of his heart brings forth the good thing; and the wicked man from out of the wicked treasure  of his heart brings forth the bad; for from the abundance of the heart [2speaks  1his mouth]. 

46.  Build on the Rock And why do you call me, O Lord, O Lord, and do not do what I say?

47. Every one  coming to me, and hearing my  words, and doing them, I will show plainly to you what he is likened to.

48. He is likened to a man building a house, who dug, and deepened, and set a foundation upon the rock. And an inundation having become, [3beat against 1the 2river]  that house, and was not strong enough to shake it; for it was founded upon the rock.

49. And the one hearing, and not doing, is likened to a man having built a house upon the ground without the help of a foundation, which [3beat against 1the 2river], and immediately it fell, and [4became 1the 2breakup  3of that house] great.  

## Luke 7

1.  The Believing Centurion And when he fulfilled all  his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

2. [4of a centurion 1And 2a certain 3servant 6an illness 5having], about to come to an end, who was of value to him;

3. and having heard concerning  Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him that having come he should preserve  his servant.

4. And the ones having come to  Jesus, appealed to him diligently, saying that, [5worthy 4is 1The one whom 2he shall grant 3this].

5. For he loves  our nation; and the synagogue he himself built for us.

6.  And Jesus went with them; but already he not being far at a distance from the house, [3sent forth 5to 6him 1the 2centurion 4friends], saying to him, O Lord, be not inconvenienced! for not am I fit that [2under  3my roof 1you should enter].

7. Therefore not even myself I deem worthy [2to 3you 1to come], but say the word! and [2shall be healed  1my servant].

8. For also I am a man [2under 3authority 1ordering], having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go! and he goes; and to another, Come! and he comes; and to my servant, Do this! and he does.

9. And hearing these things  Jesus marveled at him; and turning to [2following 3him 1the multitude] said, I say to you, not even in  Israel [2so great 3a belief 1found I].

10. And [3having returned 1the ones 2having been sent forth] unto the house, found the weakened servant being in health. 

11.  The Widow's Son Raised to Life And it came to pass in the next place, he went into a city being called Nain; and going with him  [2of his disciples 1were a fit amount], and [2multitude 1a great].

12. And as he approached to the gate of the city, that behold, [2was conveyed 1one having died], a son, an only child  of his mother, and she was a widow; and a multitude of the city, a fit amount was with her.

13. And beholding her, the Lord was moved with compassion over her, and he said to her, Do not weep!

14. And coming forward he touched the coffin, and the ones bearing it stopped. And he said, O young man, to you I say, Arise!

15. And [3sat erect 1the 2dead one], and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.

16. [3took hold 1And 2fear] of all, and they glorified  God, saying that, [2prophet 1A great] has been risen up among us; and that, God visited  his people.

17. And went forth  this word in the whole  of Judea concerning him, and in all the place round about. 

18.  John the Baptist Sends Disciples to Jesus And [2reported 3to John,  1his disciples], concerning all these things.

19. And calling on a certain two  of his disciples,  John sent them forth to  Jesus, saying, Are you the coming one, or another should we expect?

20. And having come to him, the men said, John the baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you the coming one, or another should we expect?

21. [2in 3the same 1And]  hour he cured many from diseases, and scourges, and [2spirits 1evil]; and [2blind 1to many] he granted  to see.

22. And answering  Jesus said to them, Having gone, report to John what you saw and heard! that blind gained sight, lame walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf-mutes hear, dead are raised, poor are being announced good news;

23. and blessed is who ever should not be stumbled in me.

24. [5having gone forth 1And 2the 3messengers 4of John], he began to speak to the multitudes concerning John, What have you come forth into the wilderness to view? A reed by the wind being shaken?

25. But what have you come forth to behold? A man in soft garments being clothed? Behold, the ones in [2clothes 1noble] and [2in luxury 1existing 4in 5the 6palaces 3are].

26. But what have you come forth to behold? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more extra a prophet.

27. This is he concerning of which it has been written, Behold, I send  my messenger before your face, who shall carefully prepare  your way before you.

28. For I say to you, a greater [2among 1born] women than the prophet John the baptist no one is. But the lesser in the kingdom  of God [2greater 3than he 1is].

29. And all the people having heard, and the tax collectors, justified  God, having been immersed in the immersion of John.

30. But the Pharisees and the legal experts, the counsel  of God, disregarded for themselves, not having been immersed by him.

31. What then shall I liken the men  of this generation? and to what are they likened?

32. They are likened to children, to the ones in the market sitting down, and calling out to one another, and they say, We piped to you, and you danced not; we lamented to you, and you wept not.

33. [5has come 1For 2John 3the 4baptist] neither [2bread 1eating] nor [2wine 1drinking]; and you say, [2a demon 1He has].

34. [4has come 1The 2son  3of man] eating and drinking; and you say, Behold, a man glutton, and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.

35. And [2was justified  1wisdom] by  [2her children 1all]. 

36.  A Woman Anoints Jesus' Feet [5asked 1And 2a certain one 6him 3of the 4Pharisees] that he should eat with him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee, he reclined.

37. And behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, realizing that he reclined in the house of the Pharisee, carried an alabaster jar of perfumed liquid,

38. and stationed by  his feet behind weeping, began to rain  his feet with tears, and with the hair  of her head she wiped clean and kissed  his feet, and anointed with the perfumed liquid.

39. And beholding, the Pharisee  having invited him, said to himself, saying, If this one was a prophet, he would have known who and what kind  of woman she is who touches him, that she is a sinner.

40. And responding  Jesus said to him, Simon, I have [3to you 1something 2to say]. And he says, Teacher, speak!

41. [2two 3debtors 1There were] to a certain money-lender; the one owed [2denarii 1five hundred], and the other fifty.

42. [3not 4having anything 1And 2they] to give back, both he granted pardon. Which then of them, tell, [2more 1loves him]?

43. And answering  Simon said, I undertake that to whom the more he granted pardon. And he said to him, Rightly you judged.

44. And having turned to the woman,  he said to Simon, You see this  woman? I entered into your  house, water for  my feet you gave not; but she  [2tears 1rained] for my  feet, and with the hair  of her head wiped clean.

45. [4a kiss 3to me 1You did not 2give]; but this woman from which time I entered, stopped not kissing my  feet.

46. [3with oil  2my head 1You anointed not]; but she with perfumed liquid anointed my  feet.

47. Of which favor, I say to you, [4have been forgiven  3sins 1her  2many], for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, [2little 1loves].

48. And he said to her, [4have been forgiven 3of you 1The 2sins].

49. And [3began 1the ones 2reclining together with him] to say among themselves, Who is this who even [2sins 1forgives]?

50. And he said to the woman, the belief of yours has delivered you, go in peace!  

## Luke 8

1.  Many Women Follow Jesus And it came to pass in  order, and he traveled through by city and town proclaiming and announcing good news -- the kingdom  of God; and the twelve with him,

2. and certain women who were ones having been cured from [2spirits 1evil] and weaknesses; Mary the one being called Magdalene, from whom [2demons 1seven] had come forth,

3. and Joanna wife of Chuza a caretaker of Herod, and Susanna, and [2others 1many] who served to him from  their subsistence. 

4.  The Parable of the Sower [4being together 1And 3multitude 2a great], and of the ones by city coming to him, he spoke by parable.

5. There went forth the one sowing  to sow  his own seed. And in  his sowing,  some fell by the way; and it was trampled, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.

6. And other fell upon the rock; and having germinated, it withered, on account of the not having moisture.

7. And other fell in the midst of the thorn-bushes; and growing together with the thorn-bushes they choked it.

8. And other fell upon the [2earth  1good], and having germinated, produced fruit a hundred fold. These things saying, he spoke out loud, The one having ears to hear let him hear!

9. [3asked 1And 4him  2his disciples], saying, What may [2be  1this parable]?

10. And he said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom  of God; but to the rest -- in parables, that seeing they should not see, and hearing they should not perceive.

11. [3is 1And 2this] the parable. The seed is the word  of God.

12. And the ones by the way are the ones hearing; then comes the devil and takes the word from  their heart, lest having believed they should be delivered.

13. And the ones upon the rock are the ones whenever they hear, with joy they receive the word; and these [2root 1have no], which for a time believe, and in time of test they leave.

14. And the one [2into 3the 4thorn-bushes 1falling]; these are the ones having heard, and by anxieties and riches and pleasures  of existence going along are choked, and do not bring to perfection.

15. And the one in the good earth; these are they who with [4heart 1a good 2and 3better], having heard the word, hold it, and bear fruit with patience.

16. And no one [2a lamp 1lighting] covers it with a vessel, or [2underneath 3a bed 1puts it]; but upon a lamp-stand he places it, that the ones entering shall see by the light.

17. For nothing is hidden, which [2not 4open 1shall 3become], nor concealed, which shall not be known and [2into 3the open 1should come].

18. Take heed then how you hear! For who ever should have, to him it shall be given; and whoever should not have, even what he seems to have shall be taken from him.

19. And there came to him the mother and  his brothers, and they were not able to meet with him because of the multitude.

20. And it was reported to him, saying,  Your mother and  your brothers stand outside, [2to see 3you 1wanting].

21.  But responding he said to them, My mother and my brothers are these, the ones [2the 3word  4of God 1hearing] and doing it. 

22.  Jesus Calms the Tempest And it came to pass on one of the days, and he stepped into a boat and  his disciples; and he said to them, We should go through unto the other side of the lake. And they embarked.

23. [3sailing 1And 2during their] he slept soundly. And came down a tempest of wind onto the lake, and they were filling up, and were exposed to danger.

24. And coming forward, they awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he having arisen reproached the wind and the swell  of water; and they ceased, and became a calm.

25. And he said to them, Where is the trust of yours? But fearing they wondered, saying to one another, Who then is this, that even to the winds he gives orders, and to the water, and they obey him? 

26.  Jesus Casts out Demons And they sailed down unto the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite  Galilee.

27. [3coming forth 1And 2in his] unto the land, [2encountered 3him 1a certain man] from out of the city, who had demons for [2of time 1a fit amount], and [3a garment 1he was not 2dressed in], and [2in 3a house 1he abided not], but in the tombs.

28. And beholding  Jesus, and having shouted aloud, he fell at him, and [2voice 1with a great] said, What is it to me and to you, Jesus, O son  [3God 1of the 2highest]? I beseech you [2not 4me 1that you should 3torment].

29. For he summoned the [2spirit  1unclean] to come forth from the man. For many times it seized him with force, and he was bound in chains, and [2in shackles 1being kept]; and tearing up the bonds he was driven by the demon into the wildernesses.

30. [3asked 1And 4him  2Jesus], saying, What [3given to you 1is 2the name]? And he said, Legion; because [2demons 1many] entered into him.

31. And they appealed to him that he should not give orders to them [2into 3the 4abyss 1to go forth].

32. But there was there a herd of swine, a fit amount grazing in the mountain. And they appealed to him that he should commission to them [2into 3those 1to enter]. And he commissioned it to them.

33. [4going forth 1And 2the 3demons] from the man, entered into the swine, and [3advanced 1the 2herd] down the precipice into the lake, and choked.

34. [4having beheld 1And 2the ones 3grazing] the thing taking place, fled, and having gone forth they reported in the city and in the fields.

35. And they came forth to behold the thing taking place. And they came to  Jesus, and they found [8sitting down 1the 2man 3from 4whom 5the 6demons 7had went forth], being dressed and being of a sound mind, by the feet  of Jesus; and they feared.

36. [4reported 1And 5to them 2the ones also 3beholding] how [3was delivered 1the 2demon-possessed man].

37. And [8asked 9him 1all 2the 3multitude 4of the 5place round about 6of the 7Gadarenes] to go forth from them, for [3fear 2by a great 1they were held]. And he stepping into the boat returned.

38. [9beseeched 1And 10him 2the 3man 4from 5whom 8came forth 6the 7demons] to be with him. [3released 1But 4him  2Jesus], saying,

39. Return unto  your house, and describe as much as [2did 3for you  1God]! And he went forth through the whole  city proclaiming as much as [2did 3for him  1Jesus].

40. And it came to pass in the returning  of Jesus, [3gladly received 4him 1the 2multitude]; for they were all expecting him. 

41.  Jairus Appeals to Jesus And behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue existing there. And having fallen by the feet  of Jesus, he appealed to him to enter into  his house;

42. for his daughter was an only child to him, about [2years old 1twelve], and she was dying. And in  his going, the multitudes thronged him. 

43.  Jesus Heals the Woman with the Flow of Blood And a woman being in a flow of blood for [2years 1twelve], which [4on 5physicians 1consumed 2her entire  3livelihood], not being able by anyone to be cured,

44. having come forward behind him, touched the decorative hem  of his cloak; and immediately [4stopped 1the 2flow  3of her blood].

45. And Jesus said, Who is the one touching me? [3denying 1And 2all], Peter said, and the ones with him, Master, the multitudes constrain you and squeeze, and you say, Who is the one touching me?

46.  And Jesus said, [2touched 3me 1Someone], for I know power went forth from me.

47. [4knowing 1And 2the 3woman] that she did not escape notice, [2trembling 1came], and having fallen before him, for which reason she touched him, she reported to him in the presence of all the people, and how she was healed immediately.

48.  And he said to her, Take courage, O daughter, the belief of yours has delivered you, go in peace! 

49.  Jairus' Daughter Raised from the Dead And while he was speaking, there comes one from the chief of the synagogue, saying to him that, [3has died  2daughter 1Your], do not inconvenience the teacher!

50.  And Jesus having heard responded to him, saying, Do not fear! Only trust and she shall be delivered!

51. And entering into the house, he did not allow [2to enter 1anyone], except Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the child and the mother.

52. [3wept 1And 2all], and beat their chest over her. But he said, Weep not! She died not, but sleeps.

53. And they ridiculed him, knowing that she died.

54. And he having cast all outside, and having taken hold  of her hand, spoke out loud, saying,  Child, arise!

55. And [2returned  1her spirit], and she rose up immediately. And he ordered for her to be given something to eat.

56. And [2were amazed  1her parents]; and he exhorted them [2no one 1to tell] the thing having taken place.  

## Luke 9

1.  Authority Given to the Twelve Disciples And having called together the twelve disciples, he gave to them power and authority over all the demons, and [2diseases 1to cure].

2. And he sent them to proclaim the kingdom  of God, and to heal the ones being weak.

3. And he said to them, [2nothing 1Take] for the way! neither rods, nor provision bag, nor bread, nor money, nor [2up to 3two 4inner garments 1to have].

4. And into which ever house you should enter, there abide! And from there go forth!

5. And as many as should not have received you, in going forth from  that city, even the dust of  your feet brush off for a testimony unto them!

6. And coming forth, they went through the towns, announcing good news and curing everywhere.

7. [5heard 1And 2Herod 3the 4tetrarch 7the things 8taking place 9by 10him 6all]; and he was perplexed because of  it being said by some that, John has been raised from the dead,

8. [2by 3some 1and] that, Elijah was appeared; and others that, A prophet, one of the ancient ones rose up.

9. And Herod said, John I beheaded, but who is this concerning of which I hear such? And he sought to see him.

10. And returning, the apostles described to him as much as they did. And taking them to himself, he retreated in private into [2place 1a desolate] of a city being called Bethsaida. 

11.  Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand But the multitudes, having known, followed him. And having received them, he spoke to them concerning the kingdom  of God; and the ones [2need 1having] of treatment he healed.

12. But the day began to decline; [4having come forward 1and 2the 3twelve], said to him, Dismiss the multitude! that going forth into the round about towns and  fields they should rest up, and should find provisions; for [2here 3in 4a desolate 5place 1we are].

13. And he said to them, [2give 3to them 1You] to eat! And they said, There are not with us more than five bread loaves and two fishes, unless having gone we should buy [2for 3all  4this people 1foods].

14. For there were about [2men 1five thousand]. And he said to  his disciples, Lay them down in resting-places by fifties.

15. And they did so, and they laid them [2down together 1all].

16. And having taken the five bread loaves and the two fishes, looking up into the heaven, he blessed them, and broke off in pieces, and gave to the disciples to place near to the multitude.

17. And they ate, and all were filled. And was taken up the abounding portion to them of pieces -- [2hampers 1twelve].

18. And it came to pass in  his being praying alone, [3were with 4him 1the 2disciples], and he questioned them, saying, Whom do [4me 3say 1the 2multitudes] to be?

19. And they answering said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others that, A certain prophet of the ancients rose up.

20. And he said to them, But you, whom do you say me to be? And answering Peter said, The Christ  of God.

21. And he having reproached them, exhorted them [2no one 1to tell] this,

22. having said that, It is necessary for the son  of man [2many things 1to suffer], and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and the third day to be raised. 

23.  Requirements of Discipleship And he said to all, If any wants [2after 3me 1to come], let him totally reject himself, and lift  his cross by day, and follow me!

24. For who ever should want  [2his life 1to preserve] shall lose it; but who ever should lose  his life because of me, this one shall preserve it.

25. For what benefits a man, having gained the [2world 1whole], [3himself 1but 2destroying] or suffering loss?

26. For who ever is ashamed of me and  my words, this one the son  of man will be ashamed of whenever he should come in  his glory, and of the father, and of the holy angels.

27. But I say to you truly, there are some of the ones here standing who in no way shall taste death until whenever they should see the kingdom  of God. 

28.  Jesus is Transformed And it came to pass after  these words, about [2days 1eight]; and having taken with himself Peter and John and James, he ascended into the mountain to pray.

29. And it came to pass in  his praying, the form  of his person became another, and  his clothes [2white 1flashing].

30. And behold, [2men 1two] conversed together with him, who were Moses and Elijah.

31. The ones appearing in glory spoke of  his departure which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.

32.  And Peter and the ones with him were being weighed down with sleep; and staying awake they beheld  his glory, and the two men  standing with him.

33. And it came to pass in  their parting from him, Peter said to  Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; for we should make [2tents 1three] -- one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah; not knowing what he says.

34. [4these things 1And 2of his 3saying] there came a cloud and overshadowed them; and they were afraid in the [2of those ones 1entering] into the cloud.

35. And a voice came from out of the cloud, saying, This is  my son the beloved, of him hear!

36. And in the [2taking place  1voice], Jesus was found alone. And they were quiet, and to no one they reported in those  days anything of what they had seen. 

37.  The Demoniac Son Healed And it came to pass on the next day, of their going down from the mountain, there met with him [2multitude 1a great].

38. And behold, a man from the multitude yelled out, saying, Teacher, I beseech you to look upon  my son! for he is an only child to me.

39. And behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into a spasm with foam, and hardly retreats from him breaking him.

40. And I beseeched  your disciples that they should cast it out, and they were not able.

41. And responding  Jesus said, O [2generation 1unbelieving] and being perverted, until how long will I be with you, and endure you? Bring [2here  1your son]!

42. And while yet during his coming forward, [3tore 4him 1the 2demon] and flailed about; [3gave reproach 1and  2Jesus] to the [2spirit  1unclean], and healed the child, and gave him back to his father. 

43.  Jesus Foretells His Death [3were overwhelmed 1And 2all] at the magnificence  of God. And as all were wondering over all what Jesus did, he said to  his disciples,

44. You put into  your ears  these words! The son  of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.

45. And they knew not  this saying, and it was being covered up from them, that they should not perceive it; and they feared to ask him concerning  this saying.

46. And there entered an arguing among them -- the one who ever may be the greater of them.

47.  And Jesus knowing the arguing  of their hearts, having taken hold of a child, he set it by himself.

48. And he said to them, Who ever should receive this  child in  my name, receives me; and who ever receives me, receives the one sending me.  For the lesser [2among 3all 4you 1existing], this one will be great.

49. And responding  John said, Master, we beheld one [4by  5your name 1casting out 2the 3demons], and we restrained him, for he does not follow with us.

50. And [2said 3to 4him  1Jesus], Restrain not! for the one which is not against us [2for 3us 1is]. 

51.  A Samaritan Town Rejects Jesus And it came to pass in the filling up the days  of his being lifted up, and he  [2his face 1firmly fixed]  to go into Jerusalem.

52. And he sent messengers before his face. And having gone, they entered into a town of Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.

53. And they did not receive him, for  his face was as going to Jerusalem.

54. And knowing,  his disciples James and John said, O Lord, do you want we should tell fire to descend from  heaven and consume them as also Elijah did?

55. And turning, he gave reproach to them, and said, You do not know of what spirit you are.

56. For the son  of man came not [2lives 3of men 1to destroy], but to preserve. And they went unto another town. 

57.  Others Called to Discipleship And it came to pass in their going in the way, [2said 1a certain one] to him, I will follow you where ever you should go, O Lord.

58. And [2said 3to him  1Jesus], The foxes [2dens 1have], and the birds of the heaven shelters, but the son  of man does not have where [2the 3head 1he should lean].

59. And he said to another, Follow me! And he said, O Lord, commit it to me! having gone forth first to bury  my father.

60. [3said 1And 4to him  2Jesus], Let the dead bury  their own dead! but you going forth declare the kingdom  of God!

61. And said also another, I will follow you, O Lord, but first commit to me to dismiss the ones in  my house.

62. [3said 1And 4to 5him  2Jesus], No one having put  his hand upon a plow, and looking at the things behind, is fit for the kingdom  of God.  

## Luke 10

1.  The Mission of the Seventy And after these things, [3made manifest 1the 2Lord] even another seventy, and sent them by two before his face into every city and place where he was about to come.

2. Then he said to them, Indeed the harvest is great, but the workers few; beseech then the Lord of the harvest! that he should put workers into  his harvest.

3. Go! behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Do not bear a bag, nor provision, nor sandals! and no one in the way should you greet.

5. [2into 3which 1And] ever house you should enter, first say! Peace to this house.

6. And if there might be there a son of peace, [2shall rest 3upon 4him  1your peace]; but if not, unto you it shall return.

7. [2in 3the same 1And]  house abide! eating and drinking the things of theirs; [5worthy 1for 2the 3worker  6of his wage 4is]! Do not cross over from house to house!

8. And into what ever city you should enter, and they should receive you, eat the things being placed near to you!

9. And attend to the [2in it 1weak]! and say to them! [4approaches 5unto 6you 1The 2kingdom  3of God].

10. [2into 3which 1And] ever city you should enter, and they should not receive you, having gone forth into  its square, you say!

11. Even the dust  cleaving to us from  your city we wipe off against you. Except know this! that [4has approached 5unto 6you 1the 2kingdom  3of God].

12. But I say to you that, [5to Sodom 1in  3day 2that 4it will be more endurable] than to that city. 

13.  Woe to the Cities Woe to you Chorazin. Woe to you Bethsaida. for if in Tyre and Sidon took place the works of power which took place in you, even earlier [3in 4sackcloth 5and 6ashes 2sitting 1they would have repented].

14. Furthermore to Tyre and Sidon it will be more endurable in the judgment, than for you.

15. And you, Capernaum, the one [2unto 3the 4heaven 1having been raised up high]; unto Hades you shall be brought down.

16. The one hearing you, hears me; and the one disregarding you, disregards me; and the one disregarding me, disregards the one having sent me.

17. [4returned 1And 2the 3seventy] with joy, saying, O Lord, even the demons are submitted to us in  your name.

18. And he said to them, I viewed  Satan as lightning [2from out of 3the 4heaven 1falling].

19. Behold, I give to you the authority  to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy; and nothing [3you 1in any way 2shall injure].

20. Furthermore in this rejoice not! that the spirits submit to you. But you rejoice! that  your names are written in the heavens.

21. In the same hour [2exulted 3in the 4spirit  1Jesus], and said, I make acknowledgment to you, O father, O Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that you concealed these things from the wise and experts, and uncovered them to simple ones; Yes, O father, for thus it was benevolent before you.

22. And turning to the disciples he said, All things were delivered up to me by  my father; and no one knows who is the son, except the father, and who is the father, except the son, and to whom ever [3wants 1the 2son] to reveal.

23. And having turned to the disciples in private he said, Blessed are the eyes, the ones seeing what you see.

24. For I say to you, that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see, and saw not; and to hear what you hear, and heard not. 

25.  The Good Samaritan And behold, a certain legal expert rose up putting him to test, and saying, Teacher, what having done, [3life 2eternal 1shall I inherit]?

26.  And he said to him, In the law, what has been written? How do you read?

27.  And answering he said, You shall love the Lord  your God with all  your heart, and with all  your soul, and with all  your strength, and with all  your thought, and  your neighbor as yourself.

28. And he said to him, Rightly you answered; do this and you shall live!

29. But he wanting to justify himself, said to  Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30. And undertaking,  Jesus said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem unto Jericho, and [2robbers 1fell among], the ones who both having stripped him, and [2wounds upon him 1having placed], went forth leaving him half-dead happening by chance.

31. [2by 3chance 1And] a certain priest went down by  that way; and beholding him, he passed by on the other side.

32. And in like manner also a Levite, being at the place, having come and beholding, passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, traveling, came by him; and beholding him, he was moved with compassion.

34. And having come forward, he bound  his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and having set him upon  his own beast, he led him unto an inn, and took care of him.

35. And on the next morning, having come forth, casting down two denarii, he gave them to the inn-keeper, and said to him, Take care of him! and whatsoever you should spend besides, I in  my returning back will repay to you.

36. Which then of these  three seems to you [2the neighbor 1to have been] of the one having fallen among the robbers?

37. And he said, The one having  mercy with him. [2said 3then 4to him  1Jesus], Go, and you do in like manner!

38. And it came to pass in  their going, that he entered into a certain town. [3woman 1And 2a certain], by name Martha, welcomed him into  her house.

39. And thus there was a sister being called Mary, who also having sat by the feet  of Jesus, heard  his word.

40.  But Martha was distracted about much service, and having stood by, she said, O Lord, is it no care to you that  my sister [2alone 1left me] to serve? Speak then to her that she should aid me!

41. And answering [2said 3to her  1Jesus], Martha, Martha, you are anxious and turbulent concerning many things.

42. [3one 1But 2there is] need, and Mary [2the 3good 4portion 1chose], which shall not be removed from her.  

## Luke 11

1.  Jesus Teaches on Prayer And it came to pass in  his being in a certain place praying, as he ceased, said a certain one  of his disciples to him, O Lord, teach us to pray! as also John taught  his disciples.

2. And he said to them, Whenever you pray, say! Our father, the one in the heavens, let [2be sanctified  1your name]! Let [3come  2kingdom 1your]! Let [2become  1your will] as in heaven also upon the earth.

3.  [3our bread  4sufficient 1Give 2to us]  for the day!

4. And forgive to us  our sins! for also to them we forgive -- to all owing us. And do not insert us for a test! but rescue us from the evil!

5. And he said to them, Who among you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and should say to him, O friend, furnish to me three bread loaves!

6. since a friend of mine is come from a journey to me, and I do not have the thing I shall place for him.

7. And that one inside answering should say, Do not [3for me 2troubles 1make]! already the door is locked, and  my children [2with 3me 4in  5bed 1are]; I am not able to rise up to give to you.

8. I say to you, even if he will not give to him having risen up, because of the being his friend; indeed because of his  insistence, he will arise to give to him as much as he needs. 

9.  Ask, Seek, and Knock And I say to you, Ask! and it shall be given to you. Seek! and you shall find. Knock! and it shall be opened to you.

10. For all  asking receive; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking it shall be opened.

11. And which of you  being a father, [3shall ask 1and the 2son] for bread -- shall [3a stone 1he give 2to him], no. Shall also if he asks for a fish, shall instead of a fish [3a serpent 1give 2to him], no.

12. Or even if he should ask for an egg, will he give to him a scorpion, no.

13. If then you, [2wicked ones 1being], know [3gifts 2good 1to give] to your children; how much more the father  from heaven shall give [2spirit 1holy] to the ones asking him? 

14.  A Kingdom Divided Cannot Stand And he was casting out a demon, and it was mute. And it happened of the demon coming forth, [3spoke 1the 2mute]; and [3marveled 1the 2multitudes].

15. And certain ones of them said, By Beelzeboul, ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.

16. And others testing, [2a sign 3from 4him 1sought] from heaven.

17. But he, knowing their  thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom [2against 3itself 1being divided] is made desolate; and a house against a house falls.

18. And if also  Satan [2against 3himself 1be divided], how shall [2stand  1his kingdom]? For you say, By Beelzeboul is my casting out the demons.

19. But if I by Beelzeboul cast out the demons,  your sons, by whom do they cast out? On account of this [3your judges 1they 2shall be].

20. But if by the finger of God I cast out the demons, then came upon you the kingdom  of God.

21. Whenever the strong man, being armed, should guard  his own courtyard, [4in 5peace 3are  2possessions 1his].

22. But when the stronger than he coming should overcome him,  [2his full armor 1he takes] upon which he yields, and  his spoils he distributes.

23. The one not being with me, [2against 3me 1is]; and the one not gathering together with me, disperses.

24. Whenever the unclean spirit should go forth from the man, it goes through waterless places seeking rest; and not finding, it says, I will return unto  my house from where I came forth.

25. And having come, it finds it being swept and trimmed.

26. Then it goes and takes to itself seven other [2spirits 1more evil] than itself, and they enter to dwell there; and becomes the last  of that man worse than the first.

27. And it happened in  his saying these things, [3having lifted up 1a certain 2woman] her voice from out of the multitude, said to him, Blessed is the belly  bearing you, and the breasts which you nursed.

28. And he said, Certainly are blessed the ones hearing the word  of God and keeping it. 

29.  A Wicked Generation Seeks a Sign And the multitudes being gathered together, he began to say,  This generation is wicked; [2a sign 1it seeks anxiously], and no sign shall be given it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

30. For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so shall be also the son  of man to this generation.

31. The queen of the south shall arise in the judgment with the men  of this generation, and shall condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, more than a Solomon is here.

32. Men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with  this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the proclamation of Jonah; and behold, more than a Jonah is here.

33. And no one [2a lamp 1lighting], [2in 3a hidden place 1puts it], nor under  a bushel, but upon the lamp-stand, that the ones entering [2by the 3brightness 1shall see].

34. The lamp of the body is the eye. Whenever then  your eye might be sincere, then [2entire  3body 1your] is light. But when it might be evil, then  your body is dark.

35. Watch then lest the light, the one in you is darkness!

36. If then  [3body 1your 2entire] is giving light, not having any part dark, it will be [2giving light 1entirely], as whenever the lamp's  lighting should give you light. 

37.  Woe to the Pharisees And in  his speaking, [2asked 3him 1a certain Pharisee] that he should dine with him. And entering he reclined.

38. And the Pharisee, beholding, wondered that [2not 3first 1he immersed] before the dinner.

39. [4said 1And 2the 3Lord] to him, Now you, the Pharisees, [2the 3outside 4of the 5cup 6and 7the 8platter 1cleanse]; but the inside of you is full of seizure and wickedness.

40. Fools, did not the one making the outside, also [2the 3inside 1make]?

41. Furthermore, the things being within give charity! and behold, then all things [2clean 3to you 1are]!

42. But woe to you, to the Pharisees; for you tithe the mint and the rue and every vegetation, and pass by the judgment and the love  of God; these things are necessary to do, and those things are not to be dismissed.

43. Woe to you, to the Pharisees; for you love the first seat in the synagogues, and the greetings in the markets.

44. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for you are as the [2tombs  1concealed], and the men walking upon them have not known it.

45. And responding, a certain person of the legal experts says to him, Teacher, these things saying [2even 4us 1you 3insult].

46. And he said, And to you, to the legal experts, woe; for you load  men with loads hard to bear, and yourselves [5with one  6of your fingers 1do not 2touch 3the 4loads].

47. Woe to you; for you build the tombs of the prophets,  but your fathers killed them.

48. Then you witness and assent to the works  of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their  tombs.

49. On account of this also the wisdom  of God said, I will send unto them prophets and apostles, and of them they will kill and drive out;

50. that should be required, the blood of all the prophets  being poured out from the founding of the world, of  this generation.

51. From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, the one perishing between the altar and the house. Yes, I say to you, it will be required of  this generation.

52. Woe to you, to the legal experts; for you take away the key of the knowledge, and you yourselves do not enter, and the ones entering you restrain.

53. [3saying 1And 2of his] these things to them, [6began 1the 2scribes 3and 4the 5Pharisees] awfully to press, and to ensnare him with off-hand questions concerning many things;

54. lying in wait for him, seeking to hunt something from out of  his mouth, that they should charge him.  

## Luke 12

1.  Beware of the Hypocrisy of the Pharisees In a time when there assembled the myriads of the multitude so as to trample one another, he began to say to  his disciples, First, take heed to yourselves of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For nothing is being covered which shall not be uncovered; and hidden which shall not be made known.

3. Because as much as [2in 3the 4darkness 1you should say], [2in 3the 4light 1it shall be heard]; and what [2in 3the 4ear 1you spoke] in the inner chambers, it shall be proclaimed upon the roofs.

4. And I say to you, to my friends, fear not from the ones killing the body! and after these things having nothing more extra to do.

5. But I will plainly show to you who you should fear. Fear the one, after the killing, [2authority 1having] to put into  Gehenna. Yes, I say to you, this one fear!

6. Are not five sparrows sold [2assarion 1for two], and one of them is not forgotten before  God?

7. But even the hairs  of your head have all been counted. Do not then fear! [2from many 3sparrows 1you differ].

8. But I say to you, Every one who ever should make acknowledgement in me before  men, also the son  of man will make acknowledgement in him before the angels  of God.

9. But the one denying me before  men, will be totally rejected before the angels  of God.

10. And every one who shall say a word against the son  of man, it shall be forgiven him; but to the one [2against 3the 4holy 5spirit 1blaspheming], it will not be forgiven.

11. And whenever they should bring you unto the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious! how or what you should plead or what you should say.

12. For the holy spirit shall teach you in that same hour what is necessary to say. 

13.  The Parable of the Rich Man And said a certain one to him from out of the multitude, Teacher, tell to my brother to portion with me the inheritance.

14. And he said to him, Man, who ordained me magistrate or apportioner for you?

15. And he said to them, See and guard from the desire for wealth! for not [4in 5the 6abundance 1to anyone  3his life 2is] of  his possessions.

16. And he spoke a parable to them, saying, [5man 3a certain 4rich 6bore well 1The 2place of].

17. And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I do not have a place where to gather up  my fruits?

18. And he said, This I will do; I will demolish my  storehouses, and [2greater 1I will build]; and I will gather there all  my produce and  my good things.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many good things laid up for [2years 1many]. Rest, eat, drink, be glad!

20. [3said 1But 4to him  2God], Fool, this  night  your soul will be exacted from you; and what you prepare, to whom will it be?

21. Thus the one treasuring up for himself, and not [2unto 3God 1being rich]. 

22.  Be Not Anxious And he said to  his disciples, Because of this I say to you, [2not 1Let 5be anxious  4life 3your] in what you should eat, nor the body in what you should put on!

23. The life is more than  nourishment, and the body more than a garment.

24. Contemplate the crows! for they sow not, nor reap, to the ones which there is no storeroom nor storehouse; and  God maintains them. How much more you differ from the birds?

25. But who of you being anxious is able to add unto  his stature [2cubit 1one]?

26. If then neither the least thing you are able, why concerning the rest are you anxious?

27. Contemplate the lilies, how they grow! it labors not, nor spins; but I say to you, not even Solomon in all  his glory was clothed as one of these.

28. But if the grass in the field [2today 1being], and tomorrow [2into 3the oven 1is being thrown], the one God so clothes; how much more you, O ones of little belief?

29. And you, do not seek what you should eat, or what you should drink, and do not be raised up high!

30. For these things all the nations of the world seek anxiously; but your  father knows that you need these.

31. Furthermore, seek the kingdom  of God! and all these things shall be added to you.

32. Fear not  small flock! for [2thinks well  1your father] to give to you the kingdom.

33. Sell  your possessions, and give charity! Make to yourselves bags not growing old! a treasure unceasing in the heavens, where thief shall not approach nor moth ruin.

34. For where [2is  1your treasure], there also  your heart will be.

35. Let [3be 1your  2loins] being girded, and the lamps burning!

36. And you likened to men waiting for  their Lord, as to when he disengages from the wedding feasts, that having come and having knocked, immediately they should open to him.

37. Blessed  those servants, whom [3coming 1the 2Lord] shall find being vigilant. Amen I say to you, that he will gird himself, and lay them down, and going by will serve to them.

38. And if he should come in the second watch, and [2in 3the 4third 5watch 1he should come], and should find them thus, blessed are  those servants.

39. [3this 1But 2know]! that if [3knew 1the 2master of the house] what hour the thief comes, he would have been vigilant, and would not have let [2be dug through  1his house].

40. And you then be prepared! for the hour you think not -- the son  of man comes. 

41.  The Parable of the Manager [3said 1And 4to him  2Peter], O Lord, [3to 4us  2this parable 1do you speak], or also to all?

42. [4said 1And 2the 3Lord], Who then is the trustworthy [3manager 1and 2practical], whom [3places 1the 2master] over  his attendants,  to give in time the measure of grain?

43. Blessed is  that servant, whom [2having come  1his master] finds doing thus.

44. Truly I say to you, that over all  his possessions he will place him.

45. But if [2should say  1that servant] in  his heart, [2passes time  1My master] in coming; and he should begin to beat the manservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be intoxicated;

46. [4shall come 1the 2master  3of that servant] in a day in which he does not expect, and in an hour in which he knows not; and he shall cut him in pieces, and  his portion [2with 3the 4unbelieving 1will be put].

47. And that  servant, which having known the will  of his master, and not having prepared, nor doing according to  his will, shall be flayed much.

48. But the one not having known, but doing things worthy of strokes, shall be flayed with few. And to every one whom [2was given 1much], much shall be sought from him. And to whom they placed near much, more extra shall they ask him.

49. [3fire 1I came 2to throw] onto the earth, and what will I, if already it be lighted?

50. But an immersion I have to be immersed, and how constrained I am until of which time it should be finished?

51. Do you think that [3peace 1I came 2to execute] upon the earth? No, I say to you, but only division.

52. For there will be from  now on five in [2house 1one] being divided -- three against two, and two against three.

53. [2shall be divided 1Father] against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and she, the daughter-in-law, against  her mother-in-law.

54. And he said also to the multitudes, Whenever you should behold the cloud arising from the west, immediately you say, A heavy shower comes; and it happens thus.

55. And whenever a south wind is being blown, you say that, It will be a burning wind; and it happens.

56. Hypocrites, the surface of the heaven and of the earth you know to distinguish,  but concerning this time, how do you not distinguish?

57. And why even of yourselves do you not judge what is just?

58. For as you go with  your opponent unto the ruler, in the way make an effort to be dismissed from him; lest at any time he should drag you to the judge, and the judge should deliver you up to the exactor, and the exactor should throw you into prison.

59. I say to you, In no way shall you come forth from there, until of which ever time [2the 3last 4lepton 1you should repay].  

## Luke 13

1.  Repent or Perish [3were at hand 1And 2certain ones] at the same time reporting to him concerning the Galileans, of whom the blood Pilate mixed with  their sacrifices.

2. And responding  Jesus said to them, Do you think that  these Galileans [2sinners 3beyond 4all 5the 6Galileans 1were], that [2such things 1they suffered]?

3. No, I say to you; but if you should not repent, [2all 4likewise 1you shall 3perish].

4. Or those  ten and eight upon whom fell the tower in  Siloam, and it killed them. Do you think that these [2debtors 1were] beyond all men  dwelling in Jerusalem?

5. No, I say to you; but if you should not repent, [2all 4in like manner 1you shall 3perish]. 

6.  The Parable of the Fig-tree And he spoke this  parable. [3a fig-tree 2had 1A certain one] in  his vineyard being planted; and he came [2fruit 1seeking] on it, and he found not.

7. And he said to the vine dresser, Behold, three years I come seeking fruit on  this fig-tree, and I found not. Cut it down! Why even [2the 3land 1render] useless?

8. But he answering says to him, O master, leave it even this  year, until whenever I shall dig around it, and throw manure;

9. and if then it should produce fruit, good, but if not [2for 3the 4about to be 1you can cut it down]. 

10.  Jesus Heals the Feeble Woman And he was teaching in one of the synagogues in the Sabbath days.

11. And behold, there was a woman [2a spirit 1having] of feebleness [4years 1ten 2and 3eight], and was stooped down, and not able to raise her head totally.

12. And seeing her,  Jesus called out, and said to her, O woman, you have been loosened  of your feebleness.

13. And he placed [2upon 3her  1hands]; and immediately she was erected, and she glorified  God.

14. But responding the chief of the synagogue being indignant that [3on the 4Sabbath 2cured  1Jesus], said to the multitude, Six days there are in which it behooves to work, during these then in coming you be cured, and not in the day of the Sabbath!

15. And [3responded 4then 5to him 1the 2Lord], and said, Hypocrite, each of you in the Sabbath, does he not untie  his ox or  donkey from the stable, and having taking it away waters it?

16. And this one, [2a daughter 3of Abraham 1being], whom [2bound  1Satan], behold, ten and eight years, must she not be untied from  this bond on the day of the Sabbath?

17. And [3these things 2saying 1of his], [5were put to shame 1all 2the ones 3being adverse 4to him]. And all the multitude rejoiced over all the noble things, the ones being done by him. 

18.  The Parable of the Mustard Seed And he said, To what [5likened 1is 2the 3kingdom  4of God]? and to what shall I liken it?

19. It is likened to a kernel of mustard, which [2having taken 1a man] threw into his own garden; and it grew and became into [2tree 1a great], and the birds of the heaven encamped in the branches of it.

20. And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom  of God?

21. It is likened to leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in [3of flour 2seahs 1three], until of which time [2was leavened 1all].

22. And he traveled by cities and towns, teaching, and [2a coursing 1making] unto Jerusalem. 

23.  Enter by the Narrow Gate And said a certain one to him, O Lord, are there few  being delivered?  And he said to them,

24. Struggle to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter, and will not be able.

25. From of which ever time [3should arise 1the 2master of the house], and should lock the door, and you should begin outside to stand and to knock on the door, saying, O lord, O lord, open to us! And answering he shall say to you, I do not know you, or from what place you are from.

26. Then you will begin to say, We ate in your presence, and we drank, and in  our squares you taught.

27. And he shall say, I say to you, I do not know you, from what place you are; depart from me all  workers  of iniquity!

28. There will be the weeping and the gnashing  of teeth, whenever you should see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom  of God, but you being cast forth outside.

29. And they shall come from east and west, and north and south, and shall lie down in the kingdom  of God.

30. And behold, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.

31. On the same day came forward certain Pharisees, saying to him, Come forth, and go from here! for Herod wants to kill you.

32. And he said to them, Having gone, you tell to the fox this, Behold, I cast out demons, and [2works of healing 1I complete] today and tomorrow, and the third day I am perfected.

33. Furthermore, it is necessary for me today, and tomorrow, and the next to go; for it is not permitted a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem. 

34.  Jesus Laments Over Jerusalem Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets, and stoning the ones being sent to her. How often I wanted to assemble  your children in the manner a hen gathers  her own nest under her wings, and you wanted it not.

35. Behold, [2is left 3to you  1your house] desolate. And I say to you that, In no way shall you behold me, until whenever it should come when you should say, Being blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord.  

## Luke 14

1.  Jesus Heals on the Sabbath And it came to pass in  his coming into a certain house of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were closely watching him.

2. And behold, a certain man was dropsical before him.

3. And responding  Jesus spoke to the legal experts and Pharisees, saying, Is it allowed  [2on the Sabbath 1to cure]?

4. But they were still. And taking hold, he healed him, and dismissed him.

5. And responding to them, he said, Which of you having a donkey or ox [2into 3a well 1that falls], and not immediately will pull him up on the day of the Sabbath?

6. And they were not able to answer to him as to these things. 

7.  The Parable of the Wedding Feast And he spoke to the ones being invited a parable, giving heed how [2the 3first places 1they chose], saying to them,

8. Whenever you should be invited by anyone to wedding feasts, you should not lie down in the first place, lest at any time a more important one than you might be invited by him;

9. and having come, the one [2you 3and 4him 1having invited] shall say to you, Give place to this one! and then you begin with shame [2the 3last 4place 1to take].

10. But whenever you should be invited, having gone, recline in the last place, that whenever [4should come 1the one 2having invited 3you], he should say to you, O friend, ascend higher! Then there will be glory to you in the presence of the ones reclining together with you.

11. For every one  exalting himself shall be humbled; and the one humbling himself shall be exalted.

12. And he said also to the one having invited him, Whenever you should make a dinner or supper, do not call  your friends, nor  your brethren, nor  your relatives, nor [2neighbors 1rich]! lest at any time also they invite you in return, and there should be a recompense to you.

13. But whenever you make a banquet, call the poor, maimed, lame, blind!

14. And blessed you will be, for they do not have anything to recompense to you; for it shall be recompensed to you in the resurrection of the just. 

15.  The Parable of the Great Supper And having heard, a certain one of the ones reclining together with these, said to him, Blessed is the one who shall eat dinner in the kingdom  of God.

16. And he said to him, A certain man made [2supper 1a great], and invited many.

17. And he sent  his servant at the hour of the supper, to say to the ones being invited, Come! for already [2is prepared 1all].

18. And they began by one to ask pardon -- all of them. The first said to him, [2a field 1I bought], and I have a necessity to go forth and to see it; I ask you, Have me pardoned!

19. And another said, [3teams 4of oxen 1I bought 2five], and I go to try them; I ask you, Have me pardoned!

20. And another said, [2a wife 1I married], and on account of this I am not able to come.

21. And [2having come  1that servant], reported to his master these things. Then being provoked to anger, the master of the house said to his servant, Go forth quickly into the squares and streets of the city, and the poor and maimed and lame and blind bring here!

22. And [3said 1the 2servant], O master, it has taken place as you ordered, and still there is place.

23. And [3said 1the 2master] to the servant, Go forth into the ways and fences, and compel them to enter! that [2should be filled  1my house].

24. For I say to you that, Not one  of those men, of the ones having been invited, shall taste of my  supper. 

25.  Cost of Discipleship And going with him [2multitudes 1were great]; and having turned he said to them,

26. If anyone comes to me, and does not detest  his father and  mother, and  wife and  children, and  brothers and  sisters, and still also  his own life, he is not able [2my 3disciple 1to be].

27. And whosoever does not bear  his cross, and come after me, is not able to be my disciple.

28. For who of you wanting [2a tower 1to build], not having first sat down to tally the expense, sees if he has the things for completion?

29. that lest at any time having set its foundation, and not being able to complete it, all the ones viewing should begin to mock him,

30. saying that, This  man began to build, and was not able to complete.

31. Or what king going to engage with another king in war, does not sit first to consult if he is able with ten thousand to meet the one with twenty thousand coming against him?

32. But if not, still [3at a distance 1of his 2being], [2an embassy 1having sent], he asks the terms for peace.

33. So then, every one of you who does not send away to all the things he himself possesses, is not able to be my disciple.

34. [2is good  1Salt], but if the salt should become insipid, by what means shall it be seasoned?

35. Neither for earth, nor for manure is it fit, but outside they throw it. The one having ears to hear let him hear!  

## Luke 15

1.  The Parable of the Lost Sheep And were approaching to him all the tax collectors and the sinners to hear him.

2. And [6complained 1the 2Pharisees 3and 4the 5scribes], saying that, This one [2sinners 1favorably receives], and eats with them.

3. And he spoke to them  this parable, saying,

4. What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, leaves not the ninety nine in the wilderness, and goes after the one being lost, until he should find it?

5. And having found, he places it upon  his own shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And having come unto the house, he calls together the friends and the neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice along with me! for I found  my sheep, the one being lost.

7. I say to you that thus [2joy 1there will be] in the heaven over one sinner repenting, than over ninety nine just ones who [2no 3need 1have] for repentance. 

8.  The Parable of the Lost Coin Or what woman [3drachmas 1having 2ten], if she should lose [2drachma 1one], does not light a lamp, and sweeps the house, and seeks carefully until whenever she should find it?

9. And having found, she calls together the friends and  neighbors, saying, Rejoice along with me! for I found the drachma which I lost.

10. Thus I say to you, joy takes place before the angels  of God over one sinner repenting. 

11.  The Parable of the Lost Son And he said, A certain man had two sons.

12. And [4said 1the 2younger 3of them] to the father, O father, give to me the assigned part of the wealth. And he divided to them the livelihood.

13. And after not many days [4having gathered 5all 1the 2younger 3son], traveled abroad unto a place afar, and there dispersed  his wealth living carnally.

14. [3spending 1And 2he] all, there became [2famine 1a strong] in  that place; and he began to fail.

15. And having gone, he cleaved to one of the citizens  of that place; and he sent him forth into  his field to graze swine.

16. And he was desiring to fill  his belly from the husks which [3were eating 1the 2swine], and no one gave to him.

17. [3to 4himself 1And 2having come], he said, How many hirelings  of my father abound of bread loaves, but I with hunger perish?

18. Having risen up, I will go to  my father, and I will say to him, O father, I sinned unto the heaven, and before you;

19. and no longer am I worthy to be called your son; make me as one  of your hirelings!

20. And having risen up, he went to  his father. And still he [2far at a distance 1being], [2beheld 3him  1his father], and was moved with compassion, and running fell upon  his neck, and kissed him.

21. [4said 1And 5to him 2the 3son], O father, I sinned unto the heaven, and before you, and no longer am I worthy to be called your son.

22. [4said 1But 2the 3father] to  his servants, Bring forth the [2apparel  1foremost], and put it on him! And give a ring for  his hand, and sandals for the feet!

23. And having brought the [2calf  1well fed], sacrifice it! and eating we should be merry;

24. for this  my son was dead, and is revived; and he was lost, and was found. And they began to be merry.

25. [5was 1And  4son 2his  3elder] in the field. And as [2coming 1he approached] to the house, he heard the harmony of sound and dancers.

26. And having called on one of the servants, he inquired about what these things may be.

27. And he said to him that,  Your brother is come, and [2sacrificed  1your father] the [2calf  1well fed]; for being in health he recovered him.

28. And he was provoked to anger, and did not want to enter.  Then his father having come forth comforted him.

29. And responding he said to the father, Behold, so many years I served you, and at no time [2your command 1passed by]; and to me at no time did you give a kid, that with  my friends I should be glad.

30. And when  [2your son 1this], the one devouring your  livelihood with harlots, came, you sacrificed for him the [2calf  1well fed].

31. And he said to him, Child, you at all times [2with me 1are]; and all the things of mine are yours.

32. But to be merry and rejoice is necessary; for  [2your brother 1this] was dead, and is revived; and he was lost, and is found.  

## Luke 16

1.  The Parable of the Unrighteous Manager And he said also to  his disciples, A certain man was rich, who had a manager; and this one was accused by him as wasting  his possessions.

2. And having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render  a reckoning  of your management; [3not 1for 2you are] able any more to manage.

3. [4said 1And 5to 6himself 2the 3manager], What shall I do, for  my master removes the management from me? [4to dig 1I am not 2strong 3enough]; to beg I am ashamed.

4. I know what I shall do that whenever [3should be changed over 1the 2management], that they shall receive me into  their houses.

5. And calling on [2one 1each] of the debtors  of his master, he said to the first, How much do you owe  my master?

6. And he said, A hundred baths of olive oil. And he said to him, Take your  invoice, and sitting, quickly write fifty!

7. Thereupon to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred cors of grain. And he says to him, You take the invoice, and write eighty!

8. And [3praised 1the 2master] the [2manager  1unrighteous] for [2with practicality 1he acted]. For the sons  of this eon are more practical than the sons of the light [2in  4generation  3their own 1are].

9. And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends from out of the mammon of the unrighteous, that whenever you fail, they should receive you into the eternal tents.

10. The one trustworthy in the least also in much is trustworthy; and the one [2in 3the least 1unjust] also [2in 3much 1is unjust].

11. If then in the unjust mammon [2trustworthy 1you were not], [4the 5true 1who 3to you 2will trust]?

12. And if in that which is a stranger's [2trustworthy 1you were not],  [4your own 1who 3to you 2will give]?

13. No servant is able [2two 3masters 1to serve]; for either the one he will detest, and the other he will love; or one he will hold to, and the other disdain. You are not able [2God 1to serve] and mammon.

14. [6heard 1And 7all these things  2the 3Pharisees 5fond of money 4being], and they derided him.

15. And he said to them, You are the ones justifying yourselves before  men,  but God knows  your hearts. For the [2in 3men 1lofty thing] [2an abomination 3before  4God 1is].

16. The law and the prophets were until John. From then the kingdom  of God is announced as good news, and every one [2into 3it 1forces].

17. But easier it is for the heaven and the earth to pass away, than [4of the 5law 1for one 2dot 3to fall].

18. Every one  divorcing  his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery; and every one  [2one being divorced 3from 4a husband 1marrying], commits adultery. 

19.  The Rich Man and Lazarus [3man 1And 2a certain] was rich, and dressed in purple and linen, being merry daily and glowing.

20. [4poor man 1And 3a certain 2there was], by name Lazarus, who was laid at  his gatehouse, one having sores,

21. and desiring to be filled from the crumbs of the ones falling from the table of the rich man. And also the dogs coming licked  his sores.

22. And it came to pass for [3to die 1the 2poor man], and for him to be carried by the angels into the bosom  of Abraham. And [4died 3also 1the 2rich man], and was buried.

23. And in  Hades having lifted up  his eyes being in torment, he sees  Abraham from far off, and Lazarus in  his enfolded arms.

24. And he speaking out loud, said, O father Abraham, show mercy on me, and send forth Lazarus that he should dip the tip  of his finger in water, and should cool  my tongue; for I grieve in  this flame.

25. [3said 1And 2Abraham], Son, remember that you accepted the good things of yours in  your life, and Lazarus in like manner the bad. But now thus he is comforted, but you grieve.

26. And upon all these things, between us and you [2chasm 1is a great] firmly fixed; so that the ones wanting to pass over on this side to you are not able, nor the ones from there to us should pass through.

27. And he said, I ask then you, O father, that you should send him forth unto the house  of my father.

28. For I have five brothers, so that he should testify to them, that [3not 4also 1they 2should] come unto  this place  of torment.

29. [3says 1And 2Abraham], They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them!

30. But he said, No, O father Abraham; but if one from the dead should go to them, they shall repent.

31. And he said to him, If Moses and the prophets they did not hear, not even if one from the dead should rise up will they be yielded.  

## Luke 17

1.  Jesus Teaches on Forgiveness and Obstacles And he said to the disciples, It is inadmissible for  [3not 4to come 1the 2obstacles]; but woe to him through whom they come.

2. It would be equitable for him if a millstone of a donkey was encompassed around  his neck, and he be tossed into the sea, than that he should cause [3to stumble 1one  2of these small ones].

3. Take heed to yourselves! And if [2should sin 3against 4you  1your brother], reproach him! And if he should repent, forgive him!

4. And if seven times of the day he should sin against you, and seven times of the day should turn, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him. 

5.  Jesus Teaches on Belief And [3said 1the 2apostles] to the Lord, Add to us belief!

6. [4said 1And 2the 3Lord], If you have belief as a kernel of mustard, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be rooted out, and be planted in the sea! and it would have obeyed you.

7. But who of you [2a servant 1having] plowing or tending, who entering from out of the field, will say immediately, in his having arrived, Recline to eat!

8. But will he not say to him, Prepare something! I should have supper; and girding yourself serve me! until I should have eaten and drunk, and after these things [2shall eat 3and 4drink 1you].

9. Shall [2favor 1he have]  with that servant because he did the things being ordered to him? I think not.

10. Thus also you, whenever you should have done all the things set in order for you, say that, [3servants 2useless 1We are]; for what we ought to do we have done. 

11.  Jesus heals the Ten Lepers And it came to pass in  his going unto Jerusalem, and he went through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And of his entering into a certain town, there met with him ten leprous men, which stood at a distance.

13. And they lifted their voice, saying, Jesus, master, show mercy on us!

14. And beholding, he said to them, Having gone, display yourselves to the priests! And it came to pass in  their going away, they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, beholding that he was healed, returned with [2voice 1a great] glorifying  God,

16. and he fell upon his face by  his feet giving thanks to him; and he was a Samaritan.

17. And responding  Jesus said, Were there not  ten cleansed; [3are the 1but 4nine 2where]?

18. Were there not found any returning to give glory  to God, except  this foreigner?

19. And he said to him, Having risen up, go! the belief of yours has delivered you. 

20.  The Day of the Son of Man And having been asked by the Pharisees, When comes the kingdom  of God? he answered them and said, [4comes not 1The 2kingdom  3of God] with observation.

21. Nor shall they say, Behold, here, or, Behold, there. For behold, the kingdom  of God [2within 3you 1is].

22. And he said to the disciples, There shall come days when you shall desire [2one 3of the 4days 5of the 6son  7of man 1to see], and you will not see it.

23. And they shall say to you, Behold, here, or, Behold, there; do not go forth nor pursue!

24. For as the lightning, the one flashing from out of the one place under heaven, [2unto 3the other place 4under 5heaven 1radiates]; so it will be also the son  of man in  his day.

25. But first it is necessary for him [2much 1to suffer], and to be rejected by  this generation.

26. And as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the son  of man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married, they gave in marriage, as far as which day Noah entered into the ark, and [3came 1the 2flood] and destroyed all.

28. In like manner also as it happened in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;

29. but in which day Lot went forth from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and it destroyed all.

30. According to these things it will be in which day the son of man is revealed.

31. In that  day the one who shall be upon the roof, and  his items in the house, let him not go down to take them! And the one in the field, in like manner, let him not return to the things behind!

32. Remember  Lot's wife!

33. Who ever should seek  [2his soul 1to preserve] shall lose it; and who ever should lose it brings it forth alive.

34. I say to you, In this  night there will be two upon [2bed 1one]; the one will be taken, and the other will be left.

35. Two women will be grinding together; one will be taken, and the other will be left.

36. Two men shall be in the field; the one will be taken and the other will be left.

37. And responding they say to him, Where, O Lord? And he said to them, Where the body, there [3will be gathered 1the 2eagles].  

## Luke 18

1.  The Parable of the Widow and the Unrighteous Judge And he spoke also a parable to them, to the necessity at all times to pray, and not to tire,

2. saying, [2judge 1There was a certain] in a certain city,  [3God 1not 2fearing], and [3man 1not 2respecting].

3. And a widow was in  that city, and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of  my opponent!

4. And he did not want to for a time; but afterwards he said to himself, If even  God I do not fear, and man I do not respect;

5. yet because  [2makes 3trouble to me  1this widow], I shall avenge her, that [2not 5in 6the end 1it should 3come to pass 4bruising me].

6. [4said 1And 2the 3Lord], Hear what the [2judge  1unrighteous] says.

7.  But God, shall he in no way execute the vengeance of the ones of his chosen, of the ones yelling to him day and night, and is lenient unto them.

8. I say to you that he shall execute  his vengeance quickly. Furthermore, the son  of man, having come then, shall he find the belief upon the earth? 

9.  The Parable of the Repentant Tax Collector And he spoke also to some (the ones relying upon themselves, that they are righteous, and treating with contempt the rest)  this parable.

10. [2men 1Two] ascended unto the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.

11. The Pharisee standing [3to 4himself 2these things 1prayed],  God, I give thanks to you that I am not as the rest of the men, predacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this  tax collector.

12. I fast twice  a Sabbath, I tithe all as much as I acquire.

13. And the tax collector far off standing, wanted not even  [2his eyes 3unto 4the 5heaven 1to lift up], but beat onto  his breast, saying,  God, deal kindly with me the sinner.

14. I say to you, this one went down justified unto  his house, rather than that one. For every one  exalting himself shall be humbled; and the one humbling himself shall be exalted. 

15.  Jesus Welcomes the Children And they brought to him also the babes, that he should touch them; but seeing, the disciples reproached them.

16.  But Jesus, having called on them, said, Allow the children to come to me, and do not restrain them! for of such is the kingdom  of God.

17. Amen I say to you, Who ever should not receive the kingdom  of God as a child, in no way shall he enter into it. 

18.  The Rich Ruler And [3asked 1a certain 4him 2ruler], saying, [2teacher 1Good], what having done [3life 2eternal 1shall I do to inherit]?

19. [3said 1And 4to him  2Jesus], Why do you call me good? No one is good except one --  God.

20. The commandments you know, Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not witness falsely, esteem  your father and  your mother!

21. And he said, These all I kept from my youth.

22. And having heard these things,  Jesus said to him, Still one thing to you is missing; all as much as you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come follow me!

23.  But hearing these things, [2dejected 1he became]; for he was rich, exceedingly.

24. [3beholding 1And 4him  2Jesus 6dejected 5being], said, How with difficulty the ones  [2things 1having] shall enter into the kingdom  of God.

25. [3easier 1For 2it is] for a camel [2through 3the hole 4from an awl 1to enter], than a rich man [2into 3the 4kingdom  5of God 1to enter].

26. [4said 1And 2the ones 3hearing], Then who is able to be delivered?

27. And he said, The impossible by men, are possible with  God.

28. [3said 1And  2Peter], Behold, we left all, and we followed you.

29. And he said to them, Amen I say to you that [2no one 1there is] who left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, because of the kingdom  of God,

30. who in no way should recover much more in  this time, and in the [2age  1coming] life eternal. 

31.  The Crucifixion and Resurrection Foretold And having taken to himself the twelve, he said to them, Behold, We ascend unto Jerusalem, and shall be finished all the things being written by the prophets about the son  of man.

32. For he shall be delivered to the nations, and will be mocked, and will be insulted, and will be spit upon;

33. and having been whipped, they shall kill him; and the [2day  1third] he will rise up.

34. And they [2nothing 3of these things 1perceived]; for [3was  2thing 1this] being hidden from them, and they did not know the things being said. 

35.  Jesus Heals the Blind Beggar And it came to pass in  his approaching unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way begging.

36. And hearing the multitude traveling about, he inquired about what this may be.

37. And they reported to him that, Jesus the Nazarene is going by.

38. And he yelled out, saying, Jesus, O son of David, show mercy on me!

39. And the ones going before reproached him, that he should keep silent; but he more rather cried out, O son of David, show mercy on me!

40. And having stopped,  Jesus urged for him to be brought to him. [3having approached 1And 2at his], he asked him,

41. saying, What do you want I should do? And he said, O Lord, that I should gain sight.

42. And  Jesus said to him, Gain sight! the belief of yours has delivered you.

43. And immediately he gained sight; and he followed him, glorifying  God. And all the people having beheld, gave praise  to God.  

## Luke 19

1.  Jesus and Zacchaeus And having entered he went through  Jericho.

2. And behold, there was a man by name being called Zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector, and this one was rich.

3. And he was seeking to see  Jesus, who he is. And he was not able because of the multitude, for his stature was small.

4. And having run in front, he ascended up a wild fig-tree, that he should behold him; for by that place he was about to go.

5. And as he came unto the place, having looked up,  Jesus beheld him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, making haste come down! for today in  your house it is necessary for me to remain.

6. And making haste, he came down, and welcomed him rejoicing.

7. And having seen, all complained, saying that, With a sinful man he enters to rest up.

8. But standing, Zacchaeus said to the Lord, Behold, the half  of my possessions, O Lord, I give to the poor; and if to any what I extorted, I will give back fourfold.

9. [3said 1And 4to 5him  2Jesus] that, Today deliverance  [2in this house 1took place], in so far as he also [2a son 3of Abraham 1is].

10. [5came 1For 2the 3son  4of man] to seek and to deliver the one being lost. 

11.  The Parable of the Minas [3hearing 1And 2in their] these things, adding he spoke a parable on account of  [3near 1his 2being] Jerusalem, and their thinking that immediately [4was about 1the 2kingdom  3of God] to appear.

12. He said then, [3man 1A certain 2well-born] went unto a place afar, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

13. And having called ten of his servants, he gave to them ten minas, and said to them, Be engaged in matters until I return.

14. And his citizens detested him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We do not want this one to reign over us.

15. And it came to pass in  his returning back, having received the kingdom, that he spoke [2to be called 3to him  1for these servants], the ones to whom he gave the money, that he should know what business each did.

16. And came the first saying, O master,  your minas gained an additional ten minas.

17. And he said to him, Good, O good servant; for in the least [2trustworthy 1you were], let there be for you [2authority 1having] above ten cities!

18. And [3came 1the 2second], saying, O master,  Your mina made five minas.

19. And he said also to this one, And you become above five cities.

20. And another came saying, O master, behold,  your mina which I have is being reserved in a scarf.

21. For I feared you, for [3man 2a stern 1you are], for you take up what you rendered not, and you harvest what you sowed not.

22. And he says to him, From out of  your mouth I will judge you, O wicked servant. You knew that I [3man 2a stern 1am], taking up what I rendered not, and harvesting what I sowed not.

23. And therefore why did you not give  my money unto the money lenders table, and I having come [3with 4interest 1would have exacted 2it]?

24. And to the ones standing by, he said, Take from him the mina, and give it to the one  [2ten 3minas 1having]!

25. And they said to him, O master, he has ten minas.

26. For I say to you that, To every one  having, it shall be given; but of the one not having, even what he has shall be taken from him.

27. Furthermore,  my enemies, those of the ones not wanting me to reign over them, lead them here and butcher them in front of me! 

28.  Jesus Enters Jerusalem And having said these things, he went ahead, ascending unto Jerusalem.

29. And it came to pass as he approached unto Bethphage and Bethany, to the mountain, the one being called Olives, he sent two  of his disciples,

30. having said, Go unto the opposite town; in which entering you will find a foal being tied, upon which no one [2at any time 1of men] sat. Having untied him, lead him.

31. And if anyone asks you, On account of why do you untie? thus shall you say to him that,  His master [2need 1has].

32. And going forth, the ones having been sent found it as he said to them.

33. [3untying 1And 2of their] the foal, [2said  1his masters] to them, Why do you untie the foal?

34. And they said,  His master [2need 1has].

35. And they led him to  Jesus. And having cast their own  garments upon the foal, they sat Jesus upon him.

36. [3going 1And 2of his], they spread  their garments in the way.

37. [3approaching 1And 2of his] already to the descent of the Mount  of Olives, [6began 1all 2the 3multitude 4of the 5disciples] rejoicing to praise  God [2voice 1with a great] for all which they beheld of works of power,

38. saying, Blessed be the coming king in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

39. And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, reproach  your disciples!

40. And responding he said to them, I say to you that, if these should keep silent, the stones will have been crying out. 

41.  Jesus Weeps Over Jerusalem And as he approached beholding the city, he wept over it,

42. saying that, If you knew, even you, also indeed in  [2your day 1this], the things for your peace -- but now it was hidden from your eyes.

43. For [2shall come 1days] upon you, that [2shall put 4around  1your enemies 3a siege mound] you, and shall surround you, and shall constrain you from all sides,

44. and shall dash you and  your children with you, and they shall not leave among you a stone upon a stone; because you knew not the time  of your visitation.

45. And entering into the temple, he began to cast out the ones selling [3in 4it 1and 2buying];

46. saying to them, It has been written,  My house [2a house 3of prayer 1is]; but you made it a cave of robbers.

47. And he was teaching  by day in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him, and the foremost of the people.

48. And they did not find  what they should do; [2the 3people 1for] all depended on hearing him.  

## Luke 20

1.  The Authority of Jesus Questioned And it came to pass in one  of those days, of his teaching the people in the temple, and announcing good news, [6stood by 1the 2chief priests 3and 4the 5scribes] with the elders,

2. and they spoke to him, saying, Tell us! by what kind of authority do you do these things? or who is the one having given to you  this authority?

3. And answering he said to them, [2will ask 3you 1And I] one word, and you tell to me!

4. The immersion of John, [2from 3heaven 1was it], or from men?

5. And they reckoned to themselves, saying that, If we should say from heaven; he shall say, Therefore why then did you not believe in him?

6. And if we should say, From men; all the people will completely stone us; [3persuaded 1for 2they are] John to be a prophet.

7. And they answered, We do not know from where.

8. And  Jesus said to them, Nor do I say to you by what authority I do these things. 

9.  The Parable of the Growers And he began [2to 3the 4people 1to speak]  this parable, A certain man planted a vineyard, and handed it over to growers, and traveled abroad [2of time 1a fit amount].

10. And in the season he sent to the growers a servant that from the fruit of the vineyard they might give to him; but the growers having flayed him, sent him away empty.

11. And he proceeded to send forth another servant; but they [2that one also 1having flayed] and dishonoring him, sent him away empty.

12. And he proceeded to send forth a third; but they [2also 3this one 1having wounded], cast him out.

13. [6said 1And 2the 3master 4of the 5vineyard], What shall I do? I will send forth  my son, the beloved; perhaps beholding this one they will show respect.

14. But beholding him, the growers reasoned to themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, we should kill him, that [3becomes ours 1the 2inheritance].

15. And having cast him outside the vineyard they killed him. What then shall [5do 6to them 1the 2master 3of the 4vineyard]?

16. He shall come and shall destroy  those growers, and he will give the vineyard to others. And having heard, they said, May it not be.

17. And looking to them, he said, What then is  this having been written, The stone which [3rejected 1the ones 2building], this is become for head of the corner.

18. Every one  falling upon that  stone shall be fractured in pieces, [5upon 2whom 1but 3ever 4it should fall], it will winnow him.

19. And [6sought 1the 2chief priests 3and 4the 5scribes] to put [2upon 3him  1hands] in that same  hour, and they feared; for they knew that [3against 4them  2this parable 1he spoke].

20. And closely watching, they sent ones lying in wait, pretending themselves to be righteous, that they should take hold of his word for  delivering him up to the sovereignty, and to the authority of the governor. 

21.  Give unto Caesar And they questioned him, saying, Teacher, we know that rightly you speak and teach, and do not take face, but in truth the way  of God you teach.

22. Is it allowed for us [3to Caesar 2tribute 1to give] or not?

23. But contemplating their  cunning, he said to them, Why do you test me?

24. Display to me a denarius; whose [4does it have 1image 2and 3inscription]? And answering they said, Caesar.

25. And he said to them, Give back therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things  of God  to God.

26. And they were not able to take hold of his saying before the people; and marveling over  his answer, they were quiet. 

27.  Jesus Questioned Concerning the Resurrection But coming forward, a certain one of the Sadducees, the ones speaking against a resurrection, claiming it not to be, asked him,

28. saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If anyone's brother should die having a wife, and he [2childless 1should die], that [2should take  1his brother] the wife, and should raise up seed to his brother.

29. [2then seven 3brothers 1There were], and the first having taken a wife died childless.

30. And [3took 1the 2second] the wife, and he died childless.

31. And the third took her, and likewise also the seven; and they did not leave children, and they died.

32. And afterwards all died and the woman.

33. In then the resurrection, which of them does she become wife? for the seven had her as wife.

34. And answering [2said 3to them  1Jesus], The sons  of this age marry and give in marriage.

35. But the ones being deemed worthy  of that age to attain and of the resurrection of the ones from the dead, neither marry nor give in marriage.

36. For neither [2to die 3any longer 1are they able], [3like angels 1for 2they are], and they are sons  of God, [3of the 4resurrection 2sons 1being].

37. But that [3be raised 1the 2dead], even Moses indicated at the bush, as he says, The Lord  God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. But God is not of the dead, but of living ones; for all live to him.

39. And answering some of the scribes said, Teacher, well you spoke. 

40.  The Christ And no longer they dared to ask him anything.

41. And he said to them, How do they say the Christ [2the son 3of David 1to be]?

42. And he, David says in the book of Psalms; [3said 1The 2Lord] to my Lord, sit down at my right,

43. until whenever I put  your enemies as a footstool  for your feet.

44. David then [2him Lord 1calls], so how [2his son 1is he]?

45. [5hearing 1And 2all 3the 4people], he said to his disciples,

46. Take heed of the scribes, of the ones wanting to walk in robes, and being fond of greetings in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first place in the suppers;

47. the ones who devour the houses of the widows, and for an excuse [2long 1they pray]. These shall receive extra judgment.  

## Luke 21

1.  The Widow's Offering And looking up he beheld  [2throwing  3their gifts 4into 5the 6treasury 1the rich].

2. And he beheld a certain  [2widow 1destitute] throwing there two leptas.

3. And he said, Truly I say to you that  [3widow  2poor 1this 5more than 6all 4threw in].

4. For all these from out of  their abundance threw in the gifts for God; but she from out of  her deficiency [2all 3the 4livelihood 5which 6she had 1threw]. 

5.  Jesus Foretells Concerning the End And as some were speaking concerning the temple, that with [2stones 1goodly] and consecrated offerings it was adorned, he said,

6. As to these things which you view, there shall come days in which [2shall not be left 1a stone] upon a stone, which shall not be broken up.

7. And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when then will these things be, and what is the sign whenever these things are about to take place?

8. And he said, Take heed that you should not be misled! For many shall come in  my name, saying that, I am he, and saying, The time approaches. [2not 3then 1You should] go after them.

9. And whenever you should hear of wars and commotions, you should not be terrified. For it is necessary these things take place first; but not immediately is the end.

10. Then he said to them, [2shall rise 1Nation] against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;

11. [3earthquakes 1also 2great] in places; and [2famines 3and 4pestilences 1shall be there]; [2fearful things 1also], and [3signs 4from 5heaven 2great 1there will be].

12. But before these things all together, they shall put [2upon 3you  1their hands], and shall persecute you, and deliver you up unto synagogues, and prisons, leading you unto kings and governors because of  my name.

13. But it shall result to you for a testimony.

14. Then you put it into  your hearts not to meditate beforehand to make a defense!

15. For I shall give to you a mouth and wisdom, in which [5will not be able 6to contradict 7nor 8oppose 1all 2the ones 3being adverse 4to you].

16. But you will be delivered up even by parents, and brethren, and relatives, and friends; and they shall put to death some of you.

17. And you will be detested by all on account of  my name.

18. But a hair from  your head in no way shall perish.

19. By  your endurance acquire  your life!

20. And whenever you should behold [2being encircled 3by 4encamped armies  1Jerusalem], then know that [2approaches  1her desolation].

21. Then let the ones in  Judea flee into the mountains! And let the ones in the midst of her withdraw! And let the ones in the regions not enter into her!

22. For [3days 4of avenging 1these 2are]  to fulfill all the things having been written.

23. But woe to the ones [2in 3the womb 1having one], and to the ones nursing in those  days. For there will be [2distress 1great] upon the land, and wrath among  this people.

24. And they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and shall be taken captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be for treading by nations until [3shall be fulfilled 1the times 2of the nations].

25. And there shall be signs among the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon the earth conflict of nations, in perplexity of resounding sea and tossing about;

26. [2fainting 1men] from fear and expectation of the things coming to the inhabitable world; for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

27. And then they shall see the son  of man coming in a cloud with power and [2glory 1much].

28. But at the beginning of these things to come to pass, let [2be raised 3and 4lifted up  1your heads], because [2approaches  1your release by ransom]! 

29.  The Parable of the Fig-tree And he spoke a parable to them, Look at the fig-tree, and all the trees!

30. Whenever they should burgeon already, seeing it  yourselves, you know that already [4near 1the 2summer 3is]!

31. Thus also you, whenever you should see these things taking place, know that [4is near 1the 2kingdom  3of God]!

32. Amen I say to you, that in no way shall [3pass away  2generation 1this], until whenever all shall take place.

33. The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words in no way shall pass away.

34. But take heed to yourselves! lest at any time [3should be weighed down 1your  2hearts] in dizziness, and intoxication, and anxieties of life; and in a sudden [3upon 4you 2should stand  1that day].

35. [2as 3a snare 1For] it shall come upon all the ones being settled upon the face of all the earth.

36. Be awake then at every season! beseeching, that you should be deemed worthy to flee from all the things being about to take place, and to stand before the son of man.

37. And he was by days in the temple teaching, and by nights coming forth to lodge in the mountain  being called, Olives.

38. And all the people rose early to him in the temple, to hear him.  

## Luke 22

1.  Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus [6approached 1And 2the 3holiday 4of the 5unleavened breads], the one being called passover.

2. And [6sought 1the 2chief priests 3and 4the 5scribes] the means of how to do away with him; for they feared the people.

3. [3entered 1And 2Satan] into Judas, the one being called Iscariot, being from the number of the twelve.

4. And having gone forth, he conversed together with the chief priests and the commandants, the thing of how he should deliver him up to them.

5. And they rejoiced, and agreed [2money to him 1to give].

6. And he acknowledged it; and he sought an opportune time  to deliver him up to them separate from the multitude.

7. And came the day of the unleavened breads, in which it is necessary to sacrifice the passover.

8. And he sent Peter and John, having said, Having gone, prepare for us the passover, that we should eat!

9. And they said to him, Where do you want we shall prepare?

10. And he said to them, Behold, of your entering into the city, [2will meet 3you 1a man 5a clay vessel 6of water 4bearing]; follow him into the house of which he enters.

11. And you shall say to the master of the house, [3says 4to you 1The 2teacher], Where is the lodging where [2the 3passover 4with  5my disciples 1I should eat]?

12. And that one will show to you [2upper room 1a great] being spread out -- there prepare!

13. And having gone forth, they found as he said to them; and they prepared the passover. 

14.  The Last Supper And when it became the hour, he reclined, and the twelve apostles with him.

15. And he said to them, With desire I desired [2this  3passover 1to eat] with you before  my suffering.

16. For I say to you, that no longer in any way shall I eat of it, until whenever it should be fulfilled in the kingdom  of God.

17. And having received the cup, having given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves!

18. For I say to you, that in no way shall I drink from the produce of the grapevine, until whenever the kingdom  of God should come.

19. And having taken the bread, having given thanks he broke, and he gave it to them, saying, This is  my body, the one for you being given; this do in  my remembrance!

20. Likewise also the cup, after  having supper, saying, This  cup is the new covenant in  my blood, the one [2for 3you 1being poured out].

21. Furthermore, behold, the hand of the one delivering me up is with me at the table.

22. And  indeed the son  of man goes as  having been confirmed; except woe to that man by whom he is delivered up. 

23.  Jesus Teaches on Servanthood And they began to debate with themselves  who then it may be of them, the one [3this 1about 2to do].

24. And there became also a rivalry among them, the one -- which of them seems to be greater.

25. And he said to them, The kings of the nations dominate them, and the ones exercising authority over them [2benefactors 1are called].

26. But among you not so; but the greater among you, let him be as the younger, and the one leading, as the one serving!

27. For which is greater, the one reclining or the one serving? Is it not the one reclining? But I am in the midst of you as the one serving.

28. But you are the ones abiding with me in  my tests.

29. And I ordain to you, as [2ordained 3to me  1my father] a kingdom,

30. that you should eat and should drink at  my table in  my kingdom, and you shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes  of Israel. 

31.  Jesus Foretells Peter's Denial [4said 1And 2the 3Lord], Simon, Simon, behold,  Satan demanded [2you all  1to sift] as  grain,

32. but I beseeched concerning you, that [4should not fail 1the 2belief 3of yours], and you at some time or other having returned, support  your brethren!

33. And he said to him, O Lord, with you I am prepared even [2unto 3prison 4and 5unto 6death 1to go].

34. And he said, I say to you, Peter, in no way shall [2call out 3today 1the rooster] before  three times you should totally reject me, to not know me.

35. And he said to them, When I sent you separate of money bag, and provision bag, and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.

36. He said then to them, But now the one having a money bag take it, in like manner also the provision bag! And the one not having shall sell  his cloak and shall buy a sword!

37. For I say to you that yet this thing having been written must be finished by me, the thing saying, And with the lawless ones he was imputed. For also the things about me [2an end 1have].

38. And they said, O Lord, behold, [3swords 1here are 2two]. And he said to them, It is enough. 

39.  Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives And going forth, he went according to custom unto the mount of the olives; [3followed 1and 4him 5also  2his disciples].

40. And being at the place, he said to them, Pray to not enter into a test!

41. And he drew away from them about a stone shot; and setting his knees he prayed,

42. saying, O father, if you will to carry away  this cup from me -- except not  my will, but  yours be.

43. And appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him.

44. And being in agony, more intensely he prayed. [3became 1And  2his sweat] as clots of blood going down upon the ground.

45. And having risen up from the prayer, coming to  his disciples, he found them sleeping from the distress.

46. And he said to them, Why do you sleep? having risen up, pray that you should not enter into a test! 

47.  Jesus is Betrayed with a Kiss And yet of his speaking, behold, a multitude, and the one being called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he approached to Jesus to kiss him.

48. Jesus said to him, Judas, [5with a kiss 2the 3son  4of man 1do you deliver up]?

49. And beholding, the ones [2around 3him  1being], said to him, O Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

50. And [2struck 1one] a certain one from them, the servant of the chief priest, and removed his  [2ear  1right].

51. And responding  Jesus said, Allow unto this! And having touched  his ear, he healed him.

52. [3said 1And  2Jesus] to the ones coming unto him, the chief priests, and commandants of the temple, and elders, As against a robber do you come forth with swords and wood staves?

53. By day my being with you in the temple, you did not stretch out  hands against me. But this is your  hour, and the authority  of darkness. 

54.  Peter Denies Jesus And having seized him, they led and brought him into the house of the chief priest.  And Peter followed far off.

55. And having lit a fire in the midst of the courtyard, and of their having sat down, Peter sat in the midst of them.

56. [3beholding 1And 4him 2a certain maidservant] sitting down by the light, and having gazed upon him, said, Even this one [2with 3him 1was].

57. But he denied him, saying, O woman, I do not know him.

58. And after a little, another beholding him, said, And you [2of 3them 1are]. And Peter said, O man, I am not.

59. And [3having elapsed 1about 2an hour], [3one 1another 2certain] contended obstinately, saying, In truth also this one [2with 3him 1was]; for also he is a Galilean.

60. [3said 1And  2Peter], O man, I do not know what you say. And immediately while [2still 3speaking 1he was 5called out 4a rooster].

61. And having turned, the Lord looked at  Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he said to him that, Before the rooster calls out, you shall totally reject me three times.

62. And having gone forth outside,  Peter wept bitterly.

63. And the men  holding  Jesus, mocked him, flaying him.

64. And having covered him up, they beat his  face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy! who is the one hitting you?

65. And [2other things 1many] blaspheming they said to him. 

66.  Jesus Led unto the Sanhedrin And as it became day, there gathered together the council of elders of the people, chief priests and scribes, and they led him into  their sanhedrin, saying,

67. If you are the Christ, tell to us! And he said to them, If I should tell to you, in no way should you believe.

68. And if also I asked, in no way should you answer me, or loose me.

69. From the present [4will be 1the 2son  3of man] sitting down at the right of the power  of God.

70. [3said 1And 2all], Then you are the son  of God? And he [2to 3them 1said], You say it, for I am.

71. And they said, What still need do we have of a witness? For we ourselves heard from  his mouth.  

## Luke 23

1.  Jesus Led unto Pilate And having risen up, all the multitude of them led him unto  Pilate.

2. And they began to charge him saying, This one we find perverting the nation, and preventing [3to Caesar 1tribute 2to be given], saying himself [2Christ 3the king 1to be].

3. And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And answering to him he said, You say it.

4.  And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, Not one [2do I find 1fault] in  this man.

5. And they grew more urgent and violent, saying that, He incites the people, teaching throughout entire  Judea, beginning from  Galilee unto here.

6. And Pilate having heard Galilee, asked if the man is a Galilean. 

7.  Pilate Sends Jesus to Herod And having realized that [2under 3the 4authority 5of Herod 1he is], he sent him to Herod, [2being 3also 1he] in Jerusalem in these  days.

8. And Herod beholding  Jesus, rejoiced exceedingly, for he was wanting for a fit time to behold him, because of the hearing many things concerning him; and he hoped [2any 3sign 1to behold] by him taking place.

9. And he asked him with [2of words 1a fit amount]; but he [3nothing 1answered 2to him].

10. And standing by were the chief priests and the scribes, intensely charging him.

11. [5having treated 7with contempt 1And 6him  2Herod 3with  4his military], and having mocked him, having put around him [2attire 1bright], sent him back  to Pilate.

12. And they became friends,  both Pilate and  Herod, in this  day with one another; for beforehand [2at 3enmity 1they were being] between themselves.

13. And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

14. said to them, You brought to me  this man as perverting the people. And behold, I before you having questioned him, [2nothing 1find] in  this man for a fault of which to lay charge against him,

15. and not even Herod; for I sent you to him; and behold, nothing worthy of death is being acted by him.

16. Correcting him then, I will release him.

17. (And by necessity he had to release to them each holiday one person).

18. But they shouted aloud all at once, saying, Take this one, but release to us  Barabbas;

19. who was on account of a certain insurrection having taken place in the city, and for murder, thrown into prison.

20. Then again,  Pilate called out to them, wanting to release  Jesus. 

21.  The Jews Ask to Crucify Jesus But they were sounding out, saying, Crucify! Crucify him!

22. And the third time he said to them, For what evil did this one do? No fault for death do I find in him; correcting him then I will release him.

23. And they pressed [2voices 1with great], asking for him to be crucified. And [3prevailed  2voices 1their] and of the chief priests.

24.  And Pilate adjudged [2to take place  1their request].

25. And he released to them the one through insurrection and murder being thrown into the prison, whom they asked for;  but Jesus he delivered up to their will.

26. And as they led him away, having taken hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian,  coming from the field, they placed upon him the cross, to bear it behind  Jesus.

27. And were following him a great multitude of the people, and women, which also were beating their chest and wailing over him.

28. And having turned to them,  Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me! furthermore, [2for 3yourselves 1weep], and for  your children!

29. For behold, there come days in which they shall say, Blessed are the sterile, and bellies which bore not, and breasts which nursed not.

30. Then they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us! And to the hills, Cover us!

31. For if in the wet wood these things they do, [3in 4the 5dry 1what 2should happen]? 

32.  The Crucifixion of Jesus And they led also other two evildoers with him to be done away with.

33. And when they went forth unto the place  being called Skull, there they crucified him, and the evildoers, one on the right, and one on the left.

34. And Jesus said, O Father, forgive them! for they do not know what they do. And dividing  his garments they cast a lot.

35. And [3stood 1the 2people] viewing. And deriding also were the rulers with them, saying, Others he delivered, let him deliver himself! if this is the Christ, the one  chosen of God.

36. [5mocked 1And 6at him 4also 2the 3soldiers], coming forward and [2vinegar 1bringing] to him,

37. and saying, If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!

38. And there was also an inscription being depicted above him in letters in Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew -- This is the king of the Jews. 

39.  The Penitent Evildoer And one of the hanging evildoers blasphemed him, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!

40. And responding the other reproached him, saying, Not even do you fear  God, for [2under 3the 4same 5judgment 1you are]?

41. And we indeed justly; for worthy of what we acted, we receive; but this one did not [2out of place 1act].

42. And he said  to Jesus, Remember me, O Lord, whenever you should come in to your kingdom.

43. And [2said 3to him  1Jesus], Amen I say to you, Today with me you will be in  paradise. 

44.  Jesus Expires And it was about [2hour 1the sixth], and darkness came upon the entire  land until [2hour 1the ninth].

45. And [3was darkened 1the 2sun], and [5was split 1the 2veil 3of the 4temple] in the middle.

46. And calling out [2voice 1with a great],  Jesus said, Father, into your hands I place  my spirit. And these things having said he expired.

47. [4beholding 1And 2the 3centurion] the thing taking place, glorified  God, saying, Really,  this man was righteous.

48. And all the [2coming together 1multitudes] upon  this sight, viewing the things having taken place, were beating themselves on the breast returning.

49. [6stood 1And 2all 3the ones 4who knew 5him] afar off, even the women  following him from  Galilee, seeing these things. 

50.  The Burial of Jesus And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor, being [2man 1a good] and just,

51. (this one was not assenting together with the counsel and  their action) from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who even was waiting also himself the kingdom  of God.

52. This one came forward  to Pilate to ask the body  of Jesus.

53. And having lowered it, he swathed it in fine linen, and he put it in a tomb of dressed stone, of which was not yet any one being laid.

54. And [3day 1it was 2preparation], and Sabbath evening coming on.

55. But following closely after also were women, (the ones who were gathered together to him from out of  Galilee,) for seeing the sepulchre, and how [2was placed  1his body].

56. And having returned, they prepared aromatics and perfumed liquids; and on the Sabbath they were tranquil according to the commandment.  

## Luke 24

1.  The Resurrection of Jesus And day one of the Sabbaths, [2dawn 1at deep], they came unto the tomb, bringing [2which 3they prepared 1aromatics], and some others with them.

2. And they found the stone having been rolled away from the sepluchre.

3. And having entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it came to pass in  their being perplexed on account of this, that behold, two men stood by them in attire flashing lightning.

5. [4thrown into fear 1And 3being 2of their], and leaning the face unto the ground, they said to them, Why do you seek the living with the dead?

6. He is not here, but arisen. Remember! as he spoke to you still being in  Galilee.

7. Saying that, It is necessary for the son  of man to be delivered up into the hands [2men 1of sinful], and to be crucified, and on the third day to rise up.

8. And they remembered  his sayings.

9. And they returned from the sepulchre, to report all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

10. And they were the Magdalene -- Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the rest with them, the ones who spoke to the apostles these things.

11. And [2appeared 3before 4them 5as 6nonsense  1their words], and they disbelieved them.

12.  But Peter having risen up, ran unto the sepulchre; and having leaned over, he sees the linen bands being situated alone, and he went forth to his own place wondering at the thing having taken place. 

13.  Jesus Appears and Ascends into Heaven And behold, two of them were going on the same  day unto a town at a distance [2stadiums 1of sixty] from Jerusalem -- the name is Emmaus.

14. And they were consorting with one another concerning all  these things coming to pass.

15. And it happened during  their consorting and debating, that Jesus himself having approached, went with them.

16. And their eyes were kept  to not recognize him.

17. And he said to them, What  words are these which you argue with one another while walking, and are looking downcast?

18. And answering the one whose name was Cleopas, said to him, You alone sojourn in Jerusalem, and you do not know the things taking place in it in  these days?

19. And he said to them, What kind? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man, a prophet, mighty in work and word before  God and all the people.

20. And how that [5delivered him up 1the 2chief priests 3and  4our rulers] unto the judgment of death, and they crucified him.

21. But we were hoping that he is the one about to ransom  Israel. But indeed with all these things, [3this third 4day 2leads in 1today], from which time these things took place.

22. But also certain women from us amazed us, happening at daybreak unto the sepulchre;

23. and not having found  his body, they came saying also [2an apparition 3of angels 1to have seen], ones who say him to be living.

24. And [5went forth 1some 2of the ones 3with 4us] unto the sepulchre, and found it so as also the women said; but him they did not see.

25. And he said to them, O unthinking ones and slow  in heart  to trust upon all which [3spoke 1the 2prophets].

26. Is it not [5these things 1necessary 4to suffer 2the 3Christ], and to enter into  his glory?

27. And beginning from Moses, and from all of the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

28. And they approached unto the town where they were going. And he pretended [2farther 1to be going].

29. And they pressured him, saying, Stay with us, for [2towards 3evening 1it is], and [3has declined 1the 2day]. And he entered  to stay with them.

30. And it came to pass in  his lying down to eat with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken gave it over to them.

31. And their [2were opened wide  1eyes], and they recognized him. And he [2invisible 1became] to them.

32. And they said to one another, [2not  3our heart 4burning 1Was] in us as he was speaking to us in the way, and as he opened wide to us the scriptures?

33. And rising up the same  hour, they returned into Jerusalem, and they found [3being gathered together 1the 2eleven], and the ones with them,

34. saying that, [3is risen 1The 2Lord] really, and he appeared to Simon.

35. And they described the things in the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.

36. [4these things 1And 2of their 3speaking], Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them, Peace to you.

37. And being terrified, and [2thrown into fear 1becoming], they thought [2a spirit 1they viewed].

38. And he said to them, Why are you disturbed? and why do thoughts ascend into  your hearts?

39. Behold  my hands and  my feet, that [3he 1I 2am]! Handle me and see! for a spirit [3flesh 4and 5bones 1does not 2have], as you view me having.

40. And this having said, he displayed to them his hands and his feet.

41. And yet of their disbelieving from the joy, and marveling, he said to them, Have you anything eatable here?

42. And they gave over to him [3fish 2of a roasted 1part], and some from a bee's honeycomb.

43. And having taken before them, he ate.

44. And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while still being with you, that it is necessary to fulfill all the things being written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me.

45. Then he opened wide their  mind  to perceive the scriptures.

46. And he said to them that, Thus it has been written, and thus it is necessary for [3to suffer 1the 2Christ], and to be raised up from the dead in the third day;

47. and [5to be proclaimed 6in  7his name 1repentance 2and 3release 4of sins] unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

48. And you are witnesses of these things.

49. And behold, I send the promise  of my father unto you. But you stay in the city of Jerusalem! until of which time you shall be clothed with power of the height.

50. And he led them outside as far as unto Bethany. And having lifted up  his hands, he blessed them.

51. And it came to pass in  his blessing them, he was parted from them, and was borne into the heaven.

52. And they having done obeisance to him, returned unto Jerusalem with [2joy 1great].

53. And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing  God. Amen.
