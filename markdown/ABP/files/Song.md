2. As a lily in the midst of thorn-bushes, thus  is my dear one in the midst of the daughters.

14. You are my dove in the protection of the rock, being next to the area around the wall. Show to me  your appearance, and cause me to hear  your voice! for  your voice is agreeable, and  your appearance is beautiful.

15. Lay hold for us [2foxes 1the small], that are obliterating the vineyards; for  our grapevines blossom.

16. My beloved man is to me, and I to him. He is the one tending among the lilies,

17. until of which time [3should refresh 1the 2day], and [3should move 1the 2shadows] -- return! You be like, O my beloved man, to the buck or fawn of the hinds [2upon 3the mountains 1encircling]!  

## Song of Songs 3

9. [4a carriage 3made 5for himself  1King 2Solomon] from woods  of Lebanon.

10. His columns he made of silver, and his couch of gold, his step purple; within it [2stone pavement 1a love] from the daughters of Jerusalem.

12. [2is as a garden 3being locked 1My sister], O bride; a spring having a seal upon it.

13. Your dowries are a garden of pomegranates, with the fruit of fruit trees; camphor with spikenards.

I gathered the vintage of my myrrh with my aromatics; I ate my bread with my honey; I drank wine with my milk. Eat, O dear men, and drink! and be intoxicated beloved men!

2. I sleep, but  my heart is sleepless. The voice of my beloved man knocks upon the door, saying, Open to me my sister,  my dear one, my dove, my perfect one! for  my head is filled of dew, and  my curls of the mist of the night.

4. My beloved man sent his hand through the opening, and  my belly was alarmed over him.

5. I rose up to open  to my beloved man; my hands dripped myrrh, my fingers [2of myrrh 1with full bodied] upon the handles of the bolt.

6. I opened to my beloved man; my beloved man was gone. My soul came forth for his word. I sought him, and I did not find him; I called him, and he did not hearken to me.

4. You are fair,  O dear one, as good-pleasure; beautiful as Jerusalem; a consternation as ones arranged for battle.

5. Turn away your eyes from before me! for they incited me. The hair of your head is as the herds of the goats which ascended from  Gilead.

6. Your teeth as herds of the ones being sheared, the ones which ascend from the bath,  all bearing twins, and [2one being childless 1there is not] among them. [2are as 4string 3a scarlet 1Your lips], and  your speech is beautiful.

7. [2are as 3the rind 4of the 5pomegranate 1Your cheeks] being seen outside  your veil.

8. [2sixty 1There are] queens, and eighty concubines, and young women which there is no number.

9. [2is one 1My dove], my perfect one. She is the only one to her mother; the choice one is to the one giving birth to her. [2beheld 3her 1The daughters], and [2will declare her blessed 1queens], and indeed the concubines also shall praise her.

10. Who is she, the one looking out as the dawn, fair as the moon, choice as the sun, the consternation as troops being set in order.

11. Into the garden of walnuts I went down to behold among the produce of the valley of the rushing stream; to see if [3bloomed 1the 2grapevine], [3blossomed 1or if the 2pomegranates].

12. [2did not 3know  1My soul], it made me as the chariots of Aminadab.

13. Return! return!  O Shulamite. Return! return! and we will look to you.  

## Song of Songs 7

1.  The Shulamite What shall you see in the Shulamite? She comes as a company of the camps. How you do beautify your footsteps in sandals, O daughter of Nabad. The proportions of your thighs are likened to pendants -- works of the hands of a craftsman.

2. Your navel is as [2basin 1a turned], not lacking mixed wine. Your belly is as a heap of grain shut up in lilies.

3. [2two 3breasts 1Your] are as two fawns, twins of the doe.

6. How beautiful and how delicious, O love, in your luxuries.

7. This your greatness is likened to the palm, and  your breasts to the clusters of grapes.

8. I said, I will ascend unto the palm, I will seize  its heights; and [2shall indeed be 1your breasts] as clusters of grapes of the grapevine, and the scent of your nose as apples.

9. And your throat is as [2wine  1good], going to my beloved man in straightness, suiting in my lips and teeth.

10. I turn to my beloved man, and [2is towards 3me  1his turning].

11. Come, O my beloved man! we should go forth into the field; we should lodge in towns.

12. We should rise early to the vineyards; we should see if [3bloomed 1the 2grapevine]; if [2bloomed  1the blossoms]; if [3bloomed 1the 2pomegranates]. There I will give  my breasts to you.

13. The mandrakes gave a scent, and at our doors are all the fruit trees -- new to old. O my beloved man, I kept them for you.  

## Song of Songs 8

1.  Love's Embrace Who should grant you, O my beloved man, nursing the breasts of my mother; finding you outside I should kiss you, and indeed, they will not treat me with contempt.

2. I shall take you; I shall bring you into the house of my mother, and into the inner chamber of the one conceiving me. I will give you to drink from [2wine  1scented] of the juice of my pomegranates.

3. His left hand is under  my head, and  his right hand shall embrace me.

4. I bound you by an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers, by the strengths of the field, why should you arise and why should you awaken  love until whenever it should want?

5. Who is this  ascending from the wilderness, staying upon  her beloved man? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There [2travailed 3with you  1your mother]. There she travailed with you,  giving birth to you.

6. Set me as a seal upon  your heart, as a seal upon  your arm! For [3is strong 4as 5death 1the 2love]; hard as Hades is jealousy; her sparks are sparks of the fire of her flames.

7. [2water 1Much] will not be able to extinguish  love, and rivers shall not engulf it. If [2should give 1a man] all  his livelihood for  love, with contempt men will treat it contemptuously.

8. Our sister is small and [3breasts 2no 1has]; what shall we do  for our sister in the day in which ever she should be spoken for in it?

9. If she is a wall, we should build upon her parapets of silver. And if she is a door, we will circumscribe for her [2plank 1cedar].

10. I am a wall, and  my breasts are as towers. I was in their eyes as one finding peace. 

11.  The Vineyard A Vineyard existed to Solomon in Baal-hamon. He gave over  his vineyard to the ones keeping it. Every man shall bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.

12. My vineyard, mine, is before me. The thousands to Solomon, and  two hundred to the ones keeping  its fruit.

13. O one sitting down in the gardens, the companions are taking heed to your voice. You caused me to hear!

14. Flee, O my beloved man, and be like the doe or the fawn of the hinds upon mountains of aromatics!
