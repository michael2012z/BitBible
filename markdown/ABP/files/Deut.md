# Deuteronomy

## Deuteronomy 1

1.  Moses Speaks to the Israelites These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan, in the wilderness towards the west, neighboring the red sea, between Paran Tophel and Laban, and Canyons, and Place Abounding in Gold.

2. [2eleven 3days 4from 5Horeb 1It is a journey] by mount Seir unto Kadesh Barnea.

3. And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, day one of the month, Moses spoke to all the sons of Israel according to all as much as the lord gave charge to him for them,

4. after the striking of Sihon king of the Amorites, the ones dwelling in Heshbon, and  Og king  of Bashan, the one dwelling in Astaroth and in Edrei.

5. On the other side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to make clear  this law, saying,

6. The lord  your God spoke to you in Horeb, saying, Let it be enough for you to dwell in  this mountain!

7. [2turn 3and 4depart 1You], and enter into the mountain of the Amorites, and to all the ones adjacent to the wilderness, to the mountain, and the plain, and to the south, and the coast land of the Canaanites, and Antilebanon, unto the river of the great Euphrates!

8. Behold! I have delivered up before you the land. Having entered, inherit the land! which I swore by an oath to your fathers, to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.

9. And I said to you in  that time, saying, I will not be able alone to bear you,

10. the lord  your God multiplied you. And behold, you are today as the stars of the heaven in multitude.

11. The lord  God  of your fathers may he add to you as you are a thousand times more, and bless you in so far as he spoke to you!

12. How shall I be able alone to bear  your toil, and  support you, and  your disputes? 

13.  Moses Appoints Leaders Appoint to yourselves [2men 1wise], and having knowledge, and discerning among  your tribes! And I will ordain them over you as your leaders.

14. And you answered to me, and said, [3is good 1The 2saying] which you spoke to do.

15. And I took from you [2men 1wise], and having knowledge, and discerning for  your tribes. And I ordained them to take the lead over you -- commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds, and commanders of fifties, and commanders of tens, and judicial recorders for your judges.

16. And I gave charge to your judges in  that time, saying, Hold a hearing between  your brethren, and judge justly between a man and between his brother, and between the foreigner with him!

17. You shall not discriminate for a person in a judgment; concerning the small and according to the great you shall judge equally. In no way shall you avoid justice by accepting the person of a man, for the judgment  is of God. And the matter which ever might be hard for you, you shall bear it to me, and I shall hear it.

18. And I gave charge to you at  that time all the words which you shall do.

19. And departing from out of Horeb, we went through all  [5wilderness  2great 3and  4dreadful 1that], which you beheld by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, in so far as [3gave charge 1the lord  2our God] to us; and we came unto Kadesh Barnea.

20. And I said to you, You came unto the mountain of the Amorite, the one the lord  our God gives to you.

21. Behold! [3has delivered up 6to you 1the lord  2your God 7before 8your face 4the 5land]. Ascending, you inherit it! in which manner [4spoke 1the lord  2God  3of your fathers] to you. You should not fear nor be timid.

22. And [2came forward 3to me 1you all], and said, You should send men in front of us, and let them explore [3for us 1the 2land], and let them announce to us an answer for the way through which we shall ascend by it! and the cities into which we shall enter into them.

23. And [3was pleasing 4before 5me 1the 2saying]. And I took from you twelve men -- [2man 1one] according to tribe.

24. And turning they ascended into the mountain, and came unto Ravine of Cluster, and they spied it.

25. And they took in  their hands of the fruit of the land, and carried it to you, and said, [3is good 1The 2land] which the lord  our God gives to us.

26. And you did not want to ascend, but you resisted persuasion against the word of the lord  your God.

27. And you complained in  your tents, and said, Because the lord detested us he led us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, and to utterly destroy us.

28. Where do we ascend?  And our brethren caused [2to abstain  1our heart], saying, [4nation 1It is a great 2and 3populous], and mightier than we; and [2cities 1great], and walled unto the heaven; moreover also [2sons 3of giants 1we saw] there.

29. And I said to you, Do not be alarmed, nor fear from them!

30. The lord  your God, the one going forth before your face, he will join in making war against them with you, according to all as much as he did for you in the land of Egypt,

31. and in  this wilderness which you beheld, how as [3nurtured 4you 1the lord  2your God], as if any [2should nurture 1man]  his son, according to all the way into which you were gone, until you came unto  this place.

32. And in  this word you did not entrust to the lord  your God,

33. who goes forth in front of you in the way, to choose for you a place, guiding you by fire at night, showing to you the way by which you go by it, and with a cloud by day. 

34.  Caleb and Joshua Inherit the Land And the lord heard the voice  of your words, and he being provoked swore by an oath, saying,

35. Shall [5see 1any  4men 2of these  3wicked]  [3land 2good 1this] which I swore by an oath to their fathers, no.

36. except Caleb son of Jephunneh, this one shall see it; and to this one I shall give the land upon which he mounted, and to his sons, because of  joining [4to himself 1the things 2of 3the lord].

37. And [3at me 2was enraged 1the lord] because of you, saying, Nor should you in any way enter there.

38. Joshua son of Nun, the one standing beside you, this one shall enter there; you strengthen him! for he shall allot it  to Israel and  your children, which you said [2for  3ravaging 1to be].

39. And every [2child 1new], whoever does not know today good or bad, this one shall enter there, and to these I shall give it, and to them they shall inherit it.

40. And you, in turning, encamped in the wilderness, the way  near the red sea.

41. And you answered and said to me, We sinned before the lord  our God; we, in ascending, shall wage war according to all as much as [3gave charge 1the lord  2our God] to us. And [2taking up 1each] the items  for his warfare, and gathering together, ascended into the mountain.

42. And the lord said to me, Say to them, You shall not ascend, nor wage war, [3not 1for 2I am] with you; and in no way shall you be broken before  your enemies.

43. And I spoke to you, and you did not listen to me, and you violated the word of the lord, and pressing forward you ascended unto the mountain.

44. And [6came forth 1the 2Amorite  3dwelling 4in  5that mountain] to meet you. And they pursued you as do the bees, and pierced you from Seir until Hormah.

45. And sitting you wept before the lord  your God, and [2did not 3listen to 1the lord]  your voice, nor took heed to you.

46. And you laid in wait in Kadesh [2days 1many], as many [2as 3at some other time 1days] you laid in wait.  

## Deuteronomy 2

1.  Inheritance of the Land And turning we departed into the wilderness by way [2sea 1of the red], in which manner the lord spoke to me. And we encircled  mount  Seir [2days 1many].

2. And the lord said to me,

3. [4is enough 1Your 2encircling  3this mountain]; turn then towards the north! 

4.  Mount Seir Given to Esau And [2to the 3people 1you give charge], saying, You go through the borders  of your brethren, the sons of Esau, the ones dwelling in Seir! And they shall fear you, and shall be [2cautious 3of you 1exceedingly].

5. You shall not join against them for war, for not in any way will I give to you of  their land, nor a stool for your foot; for by lot I have given to Esau  mount  Seir.

6. With silver [2foods 1buy] from them and eat, and [3water 2measured out 1you shall receive] from them by silver, and you shall drink.

7.  For the lord  your God blessed you in every work  of your hands. Determine how you went through  [5wilderness  2great 3and 4dreadful 1that]! Behold, forty years the lord  your God was with you; you did not want of a thing.

8. And we went by  our brethren the sons of Esau, the ones dwelling in Seir, by the way of the wilderness from Aelon, and from Ezion Gaber; and turning we went by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 

9.  Moab Becomes Lot's Inheritance And the lord said to me, Do not hate the Moabites, and do not join together against them in war! for in no way will I give to you of  their land. [4by 5lot  1For 6to the sons 7of Lot 2I have given  3Aroer] to inherit.

10. The Emim prior laid in wait upon it, [4nation 1a great 2and 3populous], and strong, as the Anakim.

11. [4of the Raphaim 3shall be considered 1And 2these] as also the Anakim; and the Moabites named them Emim.

12. And in Seir [3laid in wait 1the 2Horite] the former one; and the sons of Esau destroyed them, and obliterated them from their face; and they settled in place of them in which manner Israel did to the land  of his inheritance, which the lord gave to them.

13. Now then, I said, Rise up, and depart, and come near the ravine of Zared! And we went by the ravine of Zared.

14. And the days which we passed from Kadesh Barnea until of which time we went by the ravine of Zared was thirty eight years, until of which time [6perished 1all 2the 3generation 4of men 5of war], dying from the camp, as [3swore by an oath 1the lord  2God] to them.

15. And the hand  of God was upon them, to completely consume them from out of the midst of the camp, until they perished.

16. And it came to pass, as soon as [4fell 1all 2the ones 3dying], men warriors, from out of the midst of the people,

17. that the lord spoke to me, saying,

18. You shall pass over today the borders of Moab -- the Aroer.

19. And you shall lead near the sons of Ammon. Do not hate them, nor join against them in war!  for I will not give from the land of the sons of Ammon to you by lot, for to the sons of Lot I have given it by lot. 

20.  Anakim and Raphaim [2land 3of Raphaim 1It shall be considered], for even upon it [4dwelt 1the 2Raphaim  3formerly]. And the Ammonites named them Zummim,

21. [4nation 1a great 2and 3populous], and mightier than you, as also the Anakim; and [2destroyed 3them 1the lord] before their face, and they inherited them; and they were settled there in place of them until  this day,

22. even as they did inherit the sons of Esau, the ones dwelling in Seir, in which manner he obliterated the Horite from their face; and they inherited them, and they were settled in place of them until  this day.

23. And the Hivites  dwelling in Aseroth unto Gaza, and the Cappadocians  coming forth from out of Cappadocia, obliterated them, and were settled in place of them.

24. Now then, rise up and depart and go by the ravine of Arnon! Behold, I have delivered up into  your hands  Sihon king of Heshbon the Amorite and  his land. Commence to inherit it! Join against him in war!

25. On  this day commence to give the trembling of you and the fear of you upon the face of all the nations of the ones underneath the heaven! Whoever hearing  your name shall be disturbed, and [2pangs of anguish 1shall have] before your face.

26. And I sent ambassadors from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon [2words 1with peaceable], saying,

27. I will go through  your land; in the journey I will go -- I will not turn aside right nor left.

28. [3foods 4for silver 1You shall give 2to me], and I shall eat; and [2water 4for silver 1you shall give 3to me], and I shall drink; only that I shall go by on the feet,

29. as [7did 8to me 1the 2sons 3of Esau  4dwelling 5in 6Seir], and the Moabites, the ones dwelling in Ar, until whenever I should go by the Jordan into the land which the lord  our God gives us.

30. And [4did not 5want 1Sihon 2king 3of Heshbon] us to go by through his land, for [3hardened 1the lord  2our God]  his spirit, and strengthened  his heart, that he should be delivered up into  your hands, as in  this day.

31. And the lord said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up before your face  Sihon king of Heshbon the Amorite, and  his land. Commence to inherit  his land!

32. And came forth Sihon king of Heshbon to meet us, he and all  his people, for war at Jahaz.

33. And [3delivered 4him 1the lord  2our God] before our face, into  our hands; and we struck him, and  his sons, and all  his people.

34. And we held all  his cities in  that time. And we utterly destroyed every city; next also  their women, and  their children we did not leave behind for taking alive.

35. Except the cattle we despoiled for ourselves. And the spoils from the cities we took,

36. from Aroer, which is by the bank of the rushing stream Arnon, and the city  being in the ravine, and unto mount  Gilead. There was not a city which evaded us;  [3delivered up all 1the lord  2our God] into  our hands.

37. Except in the land of the sons of Ammon we did not draw near, all the parts falling in with the stream Jabbok, and the cities, the ones in the mountainous area, in so far as [3gave charge 4to us 1the lord  2our God].  

## Deuteronomy 3

1.  Sixty Cities Defeated And turning we ascended the way  into Bashan. And came forth Og king  of Bashan to meet us, he and all  his people for war, in Edrei.

2. And the lord said to me, You should not fear him, for into  your hands I will deliver him, and all  his people, and all  his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon.

3. And [3delivered 4him 1the lord  2our God] into  our hands, even  Og king  of Bashan, and all  his people. And we struck him until there was not left behind any of his seed.

4. And we held all  of his cities in  that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them; sixty cities, all the places round about Argob, of king Og in Bashan.

5. All these cities were fortified [2walls 1with high], gates, and bars; besides the cities of the Perizzites --  [2many 1very].

6. We utterly destroyed them as we did  Sihon king of Heshbon. And we utterly destroyed every city, next also the women and the children,

7. and all the cattle; and the spoils of the cities we despoiled for ourselves.

8. And we took in  that time the land from the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, the ones who were on the other side of the Jordan -- from the rushing stream of Arnon unto mount Hermon.

9. The Phoenicians named  Hermon, Sirion, but the Amorite named it Shenir.

10. All the cities of Misor, and all Gilead, and all Bashan unto Salchah and Edrei -- cities of the kingdom  of Og in  Bashan.

11. For only Og king of Bashan was left from the Rephaim. Behold  his bed is a bed of iron. Behold this is in the Akra of the sons of Ammon. Nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, in the cubit of a man. 

12.  The Israelites Inherit the Land And  that land we inherited in  that time from Aroer, which is by the bank of the stream Arnon, and the half of the mountain of Gilead. And  his cities I gave  to Reuben and  Gad.

13. And the remainder  of Gilead, and all  Bashan -- the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh; and all the place round about Argob. All that Bashan [2the land 3of Raphaim 1shall be considered].

14. And Jair son of Manasseh took all the place round about Argob, unto the borders of the Geshurites and Maachathites. And he named them after  his name --  Bashan Havoth Jair until  this day.

15. And to to Machir I gave  Gilead.

16. And to Reuben and to Gad I gave of  Gilead unto the rushing stream Arnon, between the rushing stream's border and unto the Jabbok; and the rushing streams are the border to the sons of Ammon.

17. And the Araba and the Jordan are the border from Chinnereth, and unto the sea of Araba, [2sea 1the salty] by Ashdoth  of Pisgah from the east.

18. And I gave charge to you at  that time, saying, The lord  your God has given to you  this land by lot. Arming yourselves, go forth before the face  of your brethren of the sons of Israel -- every one able!

19. Except  your wives, and  your children, and  your cattle, for I know there are many cattle to you, let them dwell at  your cities in which I gave to you,

20. until whenever [3should rest 1the lord  2your God]  your brethren, as also you, and they should have inherited also themselves the land which the lord  your God gives to you on the other side of the Jordan; then [2shall turn back 1each] to  his inheritance, which I have given to you.

21. And to Joshua I gave charge at  that time, saying,  Your eyes have seen all as much as [3did 1the lord  2our God]  [2two 3kings 1to these]; so [2shall do 1the lord] to all the kingdoms unto which you passed over there.

22. You shall not have fear of them, for the lord  our God himself shall wage war for you.

23. And I besought the lord in  that time, saying,

24. O Lord, O lord, you began to show to your attendant  your strength, and  your power, and the [2hand  1fortified], and the [2arm  1high]. For what God is in the heaven or upon the earth, who shall do as you did yourself, according to  your works, and according to  your strength?

25. Passing over then I will see  [2land  1this good], the one being on the other side of the Jordan,  [3mountain 1this  2good], and the Antilebanon.

26. And the lord overlooked me because of you. And he did not listen to me. And the lord said to me, Let it be enough for you to not add yet to speak to me  on this matter!

27. Ascend upon the top the dressed stone, and lift up  your eyes towards the west and the north and the south and the east! And behold with your eyes! for you shall not pass over  this Jordan.

28. And you give charge to Joshua, and strengthen him, and comfort him! for this one shall pass over before the face  of this people, and he shall allot to them the land which you have seen.

29. And we laid in wait in a grove in the vicinity of the house of Peor.  

## Deuteronomy 4

1.  Guard the Commandments And now, O Israel, hear the ordinances and the judgments! as many as I teach you today to do, that you should live and manifoldly multiply; and entering should be heir to the land which the lord  God  of your fathers gives to you.

2. You shall not add to the saying which I give charge to you, and you shall not remove from it. Guard the commandments of the lord  your God! as many as I give charge to you today.

3.  Your eyes have seen all as many things as [3did 1the lord  2our God] to Baal-peor. For every man whoever went after Baal-peor, [3obliterated 4him 1the lord  2your God] from you.

4. But you, the ones joining with the lord  your God, all live   today.

5. Behold! I have shown to you ordinances and judgments, as [3gave charge 4to me 1the lord  2my God],  to do thus for you in the land into which you enter there to inherit it.

6. And you shall guard and shall do; for this  is your wisdom and  your understanding before all the nations, as many as should hear all  these ordinances. Then they shall say, Behold, [6people 3is a wise 4and 5intelligent  2nation  1this great].

7. For what [2nation 1great] in which there is to it a God near to them as the lord  our God is in all things in which we should call upon him?

8. And what [2nation 1great] in which there is to it [2ordinances 3and 4judgments 1just] according to all  this law, which I give before you today? 

9.  Guard Your Life Take heed to yourself, and guard  your life exceedingly! You should not forget all the words which [2have seen  1your eyes], and let them not leave from  your heart all the days  of your life! And instruct  your sons and the sons  of your sons!

10. Specially the day which you stood in the presence of the lord  your God in Horeb, in the day of the assembly; for the lord said to me, Hold an assembly to me, [3the 4people 1and 2let] hear  my words! so that they should learn to fear me all the days which they live upon the earth, and that  [2their sons 1they should have taught].

11. And you came forward and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned fire unto the heaven -- darkness, dimness, and a storm.

12. And the lord spoke to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire. A voice of utterances you heard, and a representation you did not behold -- but only a voice.

13. And he announced to you  his covenant, which he gave charge to you to observe -- the ten discourses; and he wrote them upon two tablets of stone.

14. And [2to me 1the lord gave charge] in  that time to teach you ordinances and judgments, for you to do them upon the land into which you enter there to inherit it. 

15.  A Warning to the Israelites And you shall guard exceedingly  your lives, that you not behold any representation in the day in which the lord spoke to you in Horeb in the mountain from the midst of the fire.

16. Lest you should act lawlessly, and make to yourselves a carving representation, any image, a representation of a male or female;

17. a representation of any beast of the ones being upon the earth; a representation of any [2bird 1feathered] which flies under the heaven;

18. a representation of any reptile which crawls upon the earth; a representation of any fish, as many as are in the waters underneath the earth.

19. And lest at any time looking up into the heaven, and beholding the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and all the cosmos of the heaven wandering, you should do obeisance to them, and you should serve them, which [3bestowed 1the lord  2your God] them to all the nations  underneath the heaven.

20. [5you 1But 4took 2the lord  3God], and led you from out of the furnace  of iron, out of Egypt, to be to him [2people 1a hereditary], as in  this day.

21. And the lord  God was enraged with me on account of the things having been said by you. And he swore by an oath that I should not pass over  this Jordan, and that I should not enter into the [2land  1good] which the lord  your God gives to you by lot.

22. For I die in  this land, and I shall not pass over  this Jordan. But you shall pass over and shall inherit  [2land  1this good].

23. Take heed to yourselves! lest at any time you should forget the covenant of the lord  your God, which he ordained with you, and you should make to you yourselves a carving representation of all of which [3gave orders 4to you not to do 1the lord  2your God].

24. For the lord  your God [3fire 2a consuming 1is] -- a jealous God.

25. And if you should procreate sons and sons  of your sons, and you should pass time upon the land, and you should act lawlessly, and you should make a carving representation of any thing, and you should do the wicked thing in the presence of the lord  our God to provoke him to anger,

26. I call to testify against you today  both the heaven and the earth, that by destruction you shall be destroyed from the land in which you pass over the Jordan there to inherit it. You shall not delay long days upon it, but by obliteration you shall be obliterated.

27. And the lord shall disseminate you among all the nations, and there shall be left few of you in number among all the nations into which the lord shall bring you there.

28. And you shall serve there other gods, works of the hands of man -- wood and stones, which cannot see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

29. And you shall seek after there the lord  your God, and you shall find him whenever you should seek after him with [2entire  3heart 1your], and with [2entire  3soul 1your] in  your affliction.

30. And [3shall find 4you 1all  2these words] at the last of the days, and you shall turn towards the lord  your God, and you shall hearken to his voice.

31. For God [3is pitying 4and 5merciful 1the lord  2your God]. He will not abandon you, nor in any way will he obliterate you; he will not forget the covenant  of your fathers, which he swore by an oath to them.

32. Ask [2days 1former]! the ones having taken place prior of you, from the day of which God created man upon the earth, and upon the one extremity of the heaven unto the other extremity of the heaven, if anything has taken place according to  [2thing  1this great], if [2was heard 1such];

33. if [2has heard 1a nation] the voice of the living God speaking in the midst of the fire, in which manner you have heard and lived;

34. if God tested, entering to take to himself a nation from out of the midst of a nation, for a test; and in signs, and in miracles, and by war, and by [2hand 1a fortified], and with [2arm 1a high], and in [2visions 1great], according to all as much as [3did 1the lord  2our God] in Egypt, in the presence of your seeing;

35. so as to see yourself that the lord  your God, he is God, and there is not yet one besides him.

36. From out of the heaven [3audible 4to you 1he made  2his voice], to correct you; and upon the earth he showed you  [3fire 1his  2great]; and  his discourses you heard from the midst of the fire.

37. It is on account of  his loving  your fathers that he chose  their seed after them -- you. And he led you himself by  [3strength 1his  2great] from out of Egypt,

38. to utterly destroy [4nations 1great 2and 3stronger] than you before your face, to bring you and to give to you  their land to inherit as you have today.

39. And you shall know today, and shall turn  your mind, that the lord  your God -- he is God, in the heaven upward, and upon the earth below; and there is not any besides him.

40. And you shall guard  his commandments, and  his ordinances, as many as I give charge to you today; that [2good 3to you 1it should be], and to your sons after you, so that [2long-lived 1you should be] upon the earth, of which the lord  your God gives to you all the days.

41. Then Moses separated three cities on the other side of the Jordan of the east sun,

42. [3to flee 4there 1for the 2man-killer] who ever should have slaughtered the neighbor not knowingly, and this one having not detested him before  yesterday and the third day before. And he shall take refuge in one  of these cities, and he shall live --

43.  Bezer in the wilderness, in the land in the plain  of Reuben; and  Ramoth in Gilead to the of Gadites; and  Golon in Bashan to the Manassites.

44. This is the law which Moses placed before the sons of Israel.

45. These are the testimonies, and the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as Moses spoke to the sons of Israel in the wilderness, in their coming forth from the land of Egypt,

46. on the other side of the Jordan, in the ravine near the house of Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites whom dwelt in Heshbon, who Moses struck, and the sons of Israel, in their coming forth from out of the land of Egypt.

47. And they inherited  his land, and the land of Og king  of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, according to the rising of the sun.

48. From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the rushing stream Arnon, and upon the mountain  of Sion, which is Hermon,

49. all the wilderness on the other side of the Jordan according to the rising of the sun by Asedoth -- the one of dressed stone.  

## Deuteronomy 5

1.  Obey the Ordinances And Moses called all Israel, and he said to them, Hear O Israel, the ordinances and the judgments! as many as I speak in  your ears in  this day. And you shall learn them, and guard to do them.

2. The lord  your God ordained to you a covenant in Horeb.

3. Not with your fathers the lord ordained  this covenant, but only with you; even you here all living today.

4. Face to face the lord spoke to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire.

5. And I stood between the lord and you in  that time, to announce to you the sayings of the lord (for you were in fear from before the fire, and you did not ascend unto the mountain), saying,

6. I am the lord  your God, the one leading you from out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.

7. There shall not be [3to you 2gods 1other] before my face.

8. You shall not make for yourself a carving, nor any representation, as many as are in the heaven upward, and as many as are in the earth below, and as many as are in the waters underneath the earth.

9. You shall not do obeisance to them, nor in any way serve them; for I am the lord  your God, a jealous God, repaying the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation to the ones detesting me,

10. and executing mercy to thousands, to the ones loving me, and to the ones keeping  my orders.

11. You shall not take the name of the lord  your God in vain;  for [3shall not 4cleanse 1the lord  2your God] the one taking  his name in vain.

12. Guard the day of the Sabbaths! to sanctify it in which manner [3gave charge 4to you 1the lord  2your God]!

13. Six days you shall work, and do all  your works.

14. But the [2day  1seventh] is a Sabbath to the lord  your God. You shall not do on it any work -- you, and  your son, and  your daughter,  your manservant, and  your maidservant,  your ox, and  your beast of burden, and every beast of yours, and the foreigner  sojourning among you, that [4should have cause to rest  1your manservant 2and  3your maidservant] as also you.

15. And you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and [3led 4you 1the lord  2your God] from there by [2hand 1a fortified] and with [2arm 1a high]. On account of this [3gave orders 4to you 1the lord  2your God], so as for you to guard the day of the Sabbaths, and to sanctify it.

16. Esteem  your father and  your mother! in which manner [3gave charge 4to you 1the lord  2your God], that good should be to you, and that [2a long time 1you may be] upon the earth, of which the lord  your God gives to you.

17. You shall not murder.

18. You shall not commit adultery.

19. You shall not steal.

20. You shall not witness falsely against  your neighbor [2witness 1as a lying].

21. You shall not desire the wife  of your neighbor. You shall not desire the house  of your neighbor, nor  his field, nor  his manservant, nor  his maidservant, nor  his ox, nor  his beast of burden, nor any beast of his, nor any thing as much as  [2of your neighbor 1is].

22. These are the discourses the lord spoke to all your congregation in the mountain from the midst of the fire, darkness, dimness, storm -- [2voice 1a great]; and he did not add any more. And he wrote them upon two tablets of stone, and he gave them to me.

23. And it came to pass as you heard the voice from out of the midst of the fire, and the mountain burned fire, and there came forward to me all the leaders  of your tribes, and  your council of elders,

24. that you said, Behold, [3showed 4to us 1the lord  2our God]  his glory, and  his voice we hear from the midst of the fire. In  this day we beheld that God shall speak to man, and he shall live.

25. And now lest at any time we die, for [3shall completely consume 4us  2fire  1this great], if we [2should have added 3to hear 1ourselves] the voice of the lord  our God any more -- then we shall die.

26. For what flesh who heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire [3as 4we 2even 1shall live]?

27. You approach and hear all as much as [3should 4say 1the lord  2our God] to you! And you shall speak to us all whatever as much as [3should speak 1the lord  2our God] to you, and we will hear, and we will do.

28. And the lord heard the voice  of your words speaking to me. And the lord said to me, I heard the voice of the words  of this people, as many as they spoke to you rightly, all as many as they spoke.

29. Who shall give [2to be 3thus  1their heart] in them, so as to fear me, and to guard  my commandments all the days, that good might be to them and to their sons through the eon.

30. Proceed! Say to them! You return to  your houses!

31. But you here stand with me! and I shall speak to you all the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as you shall teach them. And let them do thus in the land which I give to them by lot!

32. And you shall guard to do in which manner [3gave charge 4to you 1the lord  2your God], to not turn aside right nor left,

33. but according to every  way which [3gave charge 4to you 1the lord  2your God] to go by it, so that he should rest you, and good might be to you, and you should prolong your days upon the land which you shall inherit.  

## Deuteronomy 6

1.  Love The LORD with Your Entire Heart And these are the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as [3gave charge 1the lord  2our God] to teach you to do thus in the land into which you enter there to inherit it.

2. That you should fear the lord  our God, to guard all  his ordinances and  his commandments which I give charge to you today, you and  your sons, and the sons  of your sons, all the days  of your life, that you should prolong your days.

3. And hear, O Israel, and guard to do! so that good might be to you, and that you should multiply exceedingly, just as [4spoke 1the lord  2God  3of your fathers] to give to you a land flowing milk and honey. And these are the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as the lord gave charge to the sons of Israel in the wilderness, in their coming forth from the land of Egypt.

4. Hear, O Israel! The lord  our God [3Lord 2one 1is].

5. And you shall love the lord  your God with [2entire  3heart 1your], and with [2entire  3soul 1your], and with [2entire  3power 1your].

6. And [7will be  1these discourses 2as many as 3I 4give charge 5to you 6today] in  your heart, and in  your soul.

7. And you shall assist [2with them  1your sons], and you shall speak of them sitting down in your house, and going in the way, and lying in bed, and arising.

8. And you shall affix them for a sign upon  your hand, and it shall be unshaken before your eyes.

9. And you shall write them upon the lintels  of your houses, and  your gates.

10. And it will be whenever [3shall bring 4you 1the lord  2your God] into the land which he swore by an oath to your fathers, to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to you [4cities 1the great 2and 3good] which you did not build;

11. houses full of all good things which you did not fill up; pits of quarrying which you did not quarry; vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant; and eating and being filled up;

12. take heed to yourself! that you should not forget the lord  your God. the one leading you from the land of Egypt, from out of a house of slavery.

13. [2the lord  3your God 1You shall fear], and to him only you shall serve, and to him you shall cleave to, and by  his name you shall swear an oath by.

14. You shall not go after other gods of the gods of the nations  surrounding you.

15. For  [3is a jealous God 1the lord  2your God] among you, lest being provoked to anger [3should be enraged 1the lord  2your God] against you, and should utterly destroy you from the face of the earth.

16. You shall not put to test the lord  your God in which manner you put to test in  Test.

17. Guarding, you shall guard the commandments of the lord  your God, and  his testimonies, and  his ordinances, as many as he gave charge to you.

18. And you shall do the pleasing and the good before the lord  your God, that [2good 3to you 1it should be], and you should enter, and should inherit the [2land  1good] which the lord swore by an oath to your fathers,

19. to drive out all  your enemies before your face, as the lord spoke.

20. And it will be whenever [2should ask 3you  1your son] tomorrow, saying, What are the testimonies, and the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as [3gave charge 1the lord  2our God] to us?

21. And you shall say to your son, We were servants to Pharaoh in the land of Egypt, and [2led 3us 1the lord] from there by [2hand 1a fortified] and with [2arm 1a high].

22. And the lord executed signs and [4miracles 1great 2and 3severe] in Egypt to Pharaoh, and to  his house in our presence.

23. And [2led us 1the lord] from there, that he should bring us, to give to us  this land which [3swore by an oath 1the lord  2our God] to our fathers to give to us.

24. And [2gave charge 3to us 1the lord] to do all  these ordinances, to fear the lord  our God, that good might be to us all the days, that we should live as even today.

25. And mercy will be to us, if we guard to do all the commandments  of this law before the lord  our God, as he gave charge to us.  

## Deuteronomy 7

1.  The LORD's Prized People And it will be in  [3bringing 4you 1the lord  2your God] into the land into which you enter there to inherit it, and he shall lift away [4nations 1great 2and 3numerous] from your presence -- the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and Canaanite, and Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite -- seven [4nations 1great 2and 3numerous], even stronger than you.

2. And [3shall deliver 4them 1the lord  2your God] into  your hands, and you shall strike them. To extinction you shall remove them. You shall not ordain with them a covenant, nor in any way should you show mercy unto them;

3. nor contract a marriage with them.  [3your daughter 1You shall not 2give] to his son, and  his daughter you shall not take to your son.

4. [3will leave 1For  2your son] from me, and shall serve other gods, and [2shall be provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] against you, and shall utterly destroy you quickly.

5. But thus you shall do to them;  [2their shrines 1you shall demolish], and  [2their monuments 1you shall break], and  [2their sacred groves 1you shall cut down]; and  [2carvings 3of the 4gods 1their] you shall incinerate by fire.

6. For [3people 2a holy 1you are] to the lord  your God. And [3preferred you 1the lord  2your God] to be to him [2people 1a prized] from all the nations, as many as are upon the face of the earth.

7. Not because you were more numerous than all the nations [2prefer 1did the lord] you, and chose you; for you are ones very few of all the nations.

8. But because the lord loved you, and to observe the oath which he swore to your fathers, [2led 3you 1the lord] by [2hand 1a fortified] and with [2arm 1a high]; and he ransomed you from out of a house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 

9.  The LORD Guards His Covenant And you shall know that the lord  your God -- this one is God, the trustworthy God, the one guarding the covenant and mercy to the ones loving him, and to the ones guarding  his commandments into a thousand generations;

10. and repaying to the ones detesting his face, to utterly destroy them. And he shall not be slow to the ones detesting; by person he shall render what is due to them.

11. And you shall guard the commandments, and the ordinances, and  these judgments, as many as I give charge to you today to do.

12. And it will be when ever you should hear  these ordinances, and should have guarded and should have done them, that [3will protect 1the lord  2your God 6with you 4the 5covenant], and the mercy which he swore by an oath to your fathers.

13. And he will love you, and shall bless you, and shall multiply you, and shall bless the descendants  of your belly, and the fruit  of your land --  your grain, and  your wine, and  your olive oil, the herds  of your oxen, and the flocks  of your sheep upon the land which the lord swore by an oath to your fathers to give to you.

14. Blessed you will be of all the nations. There will not be among you barren nor sterile, even among  your cattle.

15. And [2shall remove 1the lord] from you every infirmity; and all [3diseases 4of Egypt 1the 2severe] which you knew, he will not place upon you. And he will place them upon all the ones detesting you.

16. And you shall eat all the spoils of the nations which the lord  your God gives to you; you shall not spare  your eye over them; and no way should you serve to their gods; for [3an impediment 1this 2shall be] to you.

17. But if you should say in  your mind that, [3is great  2nation 1This]; or, I, how shall I be able to utterly destroy them?

18. You shall not fear them; remembering you shall remember as much as [3did 1the lord  2your God] to Pharaoh and to all the Egyptians;

19. the [2tests  1great] which you beheld with your eyes; the signs and  [2miracles  1those great]; the [2hand  1fortified] and the [2arm  1high]. As [3led 4you 1the lord  2your God], so [3will do 1the lord  2your God] to all the nations which you fear from their face.

20. And [4the 5swarms of wasps 3will send 1the lord  2your God] unto them, until whenever shall be obliterated the ones being left behind, and the ones being hidden from you.

21. You shall not be pierced from their face, for the lord  your God among you is a God great and fortified.

22. And [3shall consume 1the lord  2your God]  these nations from your face according to little by little. You shall not be able to completely consume them quickly, that [3might not 4become 1the 2land] wilderness, and [4should multiply 5upon 6you 1the 3beasts  2wild].

23. And [3delivered 4them 1the lord  2your God] into  your hands, and you shall destroy them [2destruction 1in a great], until whenever you should utterly destroy them.

24. And he shall deliver up  their kings into  your hands. And he shall destroy  their name under the heaven. Not shall [2withstand 1anyone] against your face until whenever you should have utterly destroyed them.

25. The carvings  of their gods you shall incinerate in fire. You shall not desire silver nor gold from them, to take for yourself, lest you should be at fault because of it, for [2an abomination 3to the lord  4your God 1it is].

26. And you shall not carry an abomination into  your house, that it be anathema as this thing. Loathing you shall loathe, and as an abomination you shall abhor it, for it is anathema.  

## Deuteronomy 8

1.  Man Shall Not Live by Bread Alone All the commandments which I give charge to you today you shall guard to do, that you should live and manifoldly multiply, and should enter and should inherit the land which [2swore by an oath 1the lord] to your fathers.

2. And you shall remember the whole journey which [3led 4you 1the lord  2your God] this fortieth year in the wilderness, how he should afflict you, and should test you, and should determine the things in  your heart, if you shall guard  his commandments or not.

3. And he afflicted you, and caused you to hunger, and fed you the manna which [2had not 3known  1your fathers]; that he should announce to you that, [3not 5by 6bread 7alone 2shall 4live  1A man]; but by every word  going forth through the mouth of God shall [2live  1a man].

4.  Your garments did not grow old from you;  your feet were not calloused -- behold, for forty years.

5. And you shall know in your heart, that as if any man should correct  his son, so the lord  your God corrects you.

6. And you shall guard the commandments of the lord  your God, to go in  his ways, and to fear him.

7.  For the lord  your God shall bring you into a land good and abundant, of which are rushing streams of waters, and springs of the deeps going forth through the plains, and through the mountains.

8. A land of wheat, and barley, grapevines, fig-trees, pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey.

9. A land upon which [3without 4poorness 1you shall eat  2your bread], and you shall not be in want upon it. A land of which  its stones are iron, and from out of  its mountains you shall mine brass.

10. And you shall eat and shall be filled up, and shall bless the lord  your God upon the [2land  1good] of which he has given to you. 

11.  Warnings in Forgetting The LORD Take heed to yourself! that you should not forget the lord  your God, so as to not guard  his commandments, and  his judgments, and  his ordinances, as many as I give charge to you today;

12. lest having eaten, and being filled up, and [3houses 2good 1having built], and dwelling in them,

13. and  your oxen, and  your sheep having been multiplied to you, and silver and gold having been multiplied to you, and all as much as to you shall be multiplying,

14. you should be raised up high in your heart, and should forget the lord  your God, the one leading you from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery,

15. the one leading you through the [4wilderness  1great 2and  3dreadful], that one of which is [2serpent 1the biting], and scorpion, and thirst, of which there was no water; the one leading to you [3from out of 5rock 4chiseled 1a spring 2of water];

16. the one feeding you the manna in the wilderness, which [2had not 3known 1you], and [2did not 3know  1your fathers]; that he should afflict you, and that he should put you to the test, and [2good 3unto you 1do] upon the last  of your days;

17. and lest you should say in  your heart,  My strength and the might  of my hand produced to me  [2ability  1this great].

18. And you shall remember the lord  your God, that he gives to you strength  to produce the ability, that he should establish  his covenant which he swore by an oath to your fathers as today.

19. And it will be if in forgetfulness you should forget the lord  your God, and should go after other gods, and should serve to them, and should do obeisance to them, I testify to you today on both heaven and the earth that by destruction you shall be destroyed.

20. As also the remaining nations, as many as the lord destroys before your face, so shall you be destroyed; because you did not hearken to the voice of the lord  your God.  

## Deuteronomy 9

1.  Israel Is Hardnecked Hear, O Israel! You pass over today the Jordan to enter to inherit [4nations 1great 2and 3stronger] than you; [4cities 1great 2and 3walled] unto the heaven;

2. a people great and populous and tall -- sons of Anak whom you know, and you have heard said, Who can withstand against the face of the sons of Anak?

3. And you shall know today that the lord  your God, he shall go forth before your face. [3fire 2a consuming 1He is]. He shall utterly destroy them, and he shall turn them away before your presence. And he shall utterly destroy them, and he will destroy them quickly, just as [2said 3to you 1the lord].

4. You should not say in  your heart by the complete consuming by the lord  your God  of these nations before your face, saying, Because of  my righteousness [2brought 3me 1the lord] to inherit  [2land  1this good]. But on account of the impiety  of these nations [2will utterly destroy 3them 1the lord] before your face.

5. Not because of  your righteousness, nor because of the sacredness  of your heart do you enter to inherit  their land. But because of the impiety  of these nations the lord shall utterly destroy them from your presence, and that he should establish the covenant which the lord swore by an oath to your fathers -- to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob.

6. And you shall know today that not through  your works of righteousness the lord  your God gives to you  [2land  1this good] to inherit; for [3people 2a hard-necked 1you are].

7. Remember! you should not forget as much as you provoked the lord  your God in the wilderness, from which day you came forth from the land of Egypt, until you came into  this place, for by resisting persuasion you completed the things against the lord.

8. And in Horeb you provoked the lord, and the lord was enraged with you to utterly destroy you.

9. Of my ascending into the mountain to take the tablets  of stone, tablets of covenant of which the lord ordained for you. And I was occupied in the mountain forty days and forty nights. [2bread 1I did not eat], and water I did not drink.

10. And [2gave 3to me 1the lord] the two tablets  of stone, being written by the finger  of God. And upon them he had written all the words, the ones which the lord spoke to you in the mountain, from amidst the fire, in the day of assembly.

11. And it came to pass through forty days and through forty nights, the lord gave to me the two tablets  of stone -- tablets of covenant.

12. And the lord said to me, Arise, go down quickly from here! for [2acted lawlessly  1your people], of whom you led out of the land of Egypt. They violated quickly from the way of which you gave charge to them; they made to themselves a molten casting.

13. And the lord said to me, saying, I have spoken to you once and twice, saying, I have seen  this people; and, behold, [2people 1it is a hard-necked].

14. Allow me! to utterly destroy them, and I will wipe away  their name from beneath the heaven. And I will make you into [4nation 1a great 2and 3strong], and more numerous rather than this one.

15. And turning, I went down from the mountain, and the mountain burned fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in  [2two 3hands 1my].

16. And seeing that you sinned before the lord  your God, and made to yourselves a calf molten image, and transgressed quickly from the way which the lord gave charge to you;

17. that taking hold of the two tablets, I tossed them from  [2two 3hands 1my], and I broke them before you.

18. And I beseeched before the lord a second time, as also even  formerly, forty days and forty nights. Bread I did not eat, and water I did not drink, on account of all  your sins which you sinned, to do the wicked thing before the lord  God, to provoke him.

19. And I am frightened on account of the rage and the anger that the lord was provoked by you  to utterly destroy you. And the lord hearkened to me even at  that time.

20. And upon Aaron the lord was enraged exceedingly  to utterly destroy him. And I made a vow also for Aaron in  that time.

21. And  your sin which you made -- the calf; I took and I incinerated it in fire, and cut it down, and ground it down exceeding, until of which it became fine, and became as a cloud of dust. And I tossed the dust into the rushing stream, the one coming down from the mountain.

22. And in  Combustion, and in  Test and in  Tombs of the Desire, you were provoking the lord  your God.

23. And when [2sent 3you 1the lord] from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Ascend and inherit the land which I give to you! that you resisted persuasion in the word of the lord  your God, and did not trust him, and did not listen to  his voice.

24. You were resisting the things towards the lord from which day he was made known to you.

25. And I beseeched before the lord forty days and forty nights. Many things I beseeched; [3said 1for 2the lord] he would utterly destroy you.

26. And I made a vow to  God, and said, O Lord, the lord, you should not utterly destroy  your people, and  your inheritance whom you ransomed in  [3strength 1your  2great], of whom you led out of the land of Egypt by  [3hand 1your  2fortified], and by  [3arm 1your  2high].

27. Remember Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,  your attendants! ones to whom you swore by an oath according to yourself. You should not look upon the hardness  of this people, and upon  their acts of impiety, and  their sins;

28. lest should say the ones dwelling the land from where you led us from there, saying, Because  [2was not 3able 1the lord] to bring them into the land which he said to them, and because of  [2detesting 1the lord] them, he led them in the wilderness to kill them.

29. And these are your people and your inheritance, of whom you led out of the land of Egypt by  [3strength 1your  2great] and by  [3arm 1your  2high].  

## Deuteronomy 10

1.  The Second Set of Tablets In that  time the lord said to me, You dress stone for yourself -- two tablets of stone as the first! And ascend to me into the mountain, and make for yourself [2ark 1a wooden]!

2. And I will write upon the tablets the words which were on the [2tablets  1first] which you broke, and you shall put them into the ark.

3. And I made the ark from out of [2wood 1incorruptible]. And I dressed the two [2tablets  1stone] as the first. And I ascended into the mountain, and the two tablets were upon  [2two 3hands 1my].

4. And he wrote upon the tablets according to the [2writing  1first], the ten words which the lord spoke to you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the gathering. And [2gave 3them 1the lord] to me.

5. And turning, I went down from the mountain, and I put the tablets into the ark which I made; and they were there as [2gave charge 3to me 1the lord].

6. And the sons of Israel departed from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakin to Mosera; there Aaron died, and he was entombed there. And [3officiated as priest 1Eleazar  2his son] instead of him.

7. From there they departed into Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jobath, a land of rushing streams of waters.

8. In that  time the lord separated the tribe  of Levi to lift the ark of the covenant of the lord, to stand before the lord to officiate, and to invoke upon  his name until  this day.

9. On account of this there is not to the Levites a portion or lot among  their brethren. The lord himself is his lot, as [3told 4them 1the lord  2your God].

10. And I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; and the lord listened to me, And in  that time [2did not 3want 1the lord] to utterly destroy you.

11. And the lord said to me, Proceed, depart before  this people, and let them enter and inherit the land! which I swore by an oath to their fathers to give to them.

12. And now, Israel, what does the lord  your God ask from you, but only to fear the lord  your God, and to go in all  his ways, and to love him, and to serve the lord  your God from [2entire  3heart 1your], and from [2entire  3soul 1your];

13. to guard the commandments of the lord  your God, and  his ordinances, as many as I give charge to you today, that [2good 3to you 1it might be].

14. Behold, [3is of the lord  4your God 1the 2heaven], and the heaven of the heaven, the earth and all as much as is in it.

15. Except concerning your fathers, the lord preferred to love them, and he chose  their seed after them -- you, from all the nations according to  this day.

16. And you shall circumcise the hardness of your heart, and  [3your neck 1you shall not 2harden] any longer.

17. For the lord  your God, he is God  of gods, and Lord  of lords, the [6God  1great 2and 3strong 4and 5fearful] who does not marvel over a person, nor should take a bribe;

18. the one executing judgment for a foreigner, and orphan, and widow; and he loves the foreigner so as to give to him bread and a garment.

19. And you shall love the foreigner; [3foreigners 1for 2you were] in the land of Egypt.

20. The lord  your God you shall fear, and to him you shall serve, and to him you shall cleave, and upon  his name you shall swear by an oath.

21. He is your boasting, and he is your God, who did among you the great and the honorable things, these things which [2beheld  1your eyes].

22. With seventy souls [2went down  1your fathers] into Egypt. But now [3made 4you 1the lord  2your God] as the stars of the heaven  in multitude.  

## Deuteronomy 11

1.  Love The LORD Your God And you shall love the lord  your God, and you shall guard  his injunctions, and  his ordinances, and  his commandments, and  his judgments all the days.

2. And you shall know today that I do not speak to  your children, as many as are not knowing, nor knew the instruction of the lord  your God, and  his magnificence, and the [2hand  1fortified], and the [2arm  1high],

3. and  his signs, and  his miracles as many as he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and all  his land;

4. and as many things as he did to the force of the Egyptians,  their chariots, and  their cavalry, as he inundated them in the water of the [2sea  1red] upon their face pursuing them from the coming after you, and [2destroyed 3them 1the lord] until  today's day;

5. and as many things as he did to you in the wilderness, until you came into  this place;

6. and as many things as he did  to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, son of Reuben; which [3opening 1the 2earth]  her mouth swallowed them, and  their houses, and  their tents, and all their  means of support  with them in the midst of all Israel;

7. for  your eyes saw all the works of the lord, the great ones, as many as he did among you today.

8. And you shall guard all  of his commandments, as many as I give charge to you today, that you should live, and should manifoldly multiply, and you should enter, and should inherit the land into which you pass over the Jordan there to inherit it;

9. that you should prolong your days upon the land of which the lord swore by an oath to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after them -- a land flowing milk and honey.

10. For it is the land into which you enter there to inherit it; [2not 3as 4the 5land 6of Egypt 1it is], from where you went forth from there; whenever they sow the seed, and water with the feet, as a garden of vegetables.

11. But the land into which you enter there to inherit it, [2land 1is a mountainous] and plain; from out of the rain of the heaven it shall drink water;

12. a land which the lord  your God oversees it always, as the eyes of the lord  your God are upon it from the beginning of the year and until the completion of the year.

13. But if in hearing you should hear all  his commandments, as many as I give charge to you today, to love the lord  your God, and to serve to him from [2entire  3heart 1your], and from [2entire  3soul 1your],

14. then he will give the rain  for your land according to season -- early and late; and you shall carry in  your grain, and  your wine, and  your olive oil.

15. And he shall give fodder in  your fields to your cattle. And having eaten and having been filled up,

16. take heed to yourselves! not widening  your heart, that you should transgress, and should serve other gods, and should do obeisance to them;

17. and [2being enraged 3should be angry 1the lord] with you, that he should hold together the heaven, and there will not be rain, and the earth shall not give  of its fruit, and you shall be destroyed quickly from the [2land  1good] which the lord gave to you. 

18.  Affix The LORD's Words for a Sign And you shall put  these words into  your heart, and into  your soul, and you shall affix them for a sign upon  your hand, and it shall be unshaken before your eyes.

19. And you shall teach [2them  1your children], to speak them sitting down in the house, and going in the way, and laying in bed, and arising.

20. And you shall write them upon the lintels  of your houses, and  of your gates;

21. that you should multiply  your days, and the days  of your sons, upon the land which the lord swore by an oath to your fathers to give to them, as the days  of heaven upon the earth.

22. And it will be if hearing you should hear all  these commandments which I give charge to you today, to do them, to love the lord  your God, and to go in all  his ways, and to cleave to him;

23. then the lord will cast out all  these nations from your face, and you shall inherit [2nations 1great], and stronger ones than you.

24. Every  place which ever [4may tread 1the 2track  3of your foot] will be yours. From the wilderness and Antilebanon, and from the river of the great river Euphrates, and unto the sea  at the descent of the sun it will be  your boundaries.

25. Not shall [2withstand 1any one] against your face. The fear of you and the trembling because of you [3shall place 1the lord  2your God] upon the face of all the land, upon which ever you should mount upon it, in which manner he spoke to you. 

26.  Blessings and Curses Behold, I give before you today a blessing and curse.

27. The blessing, if you should hear the commandments of the lord  your God, as many as I give charge to you today.

28. And the curse, if you do not hearken to the commandments of the lord  your God, as many as I give charge to you today, and you should wander from the way which I gave charge to you, having gone to serve other gods, ones who do not perceive.

29. Then it will be whenever [3should bring 4you 1the lord  2your God] into the land into which you pass over there to inherit it, then you shall give the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

30. [3not 1Behold 2are these] on the other side of the Jordan, behind the way of the descent of the sun in the land of Canaan, the people dwelling upon the descent, being next to  Gilgal, neighboring the [2oak  1high]?

31. For you are passing over the Jordan, entering to inherit the land which the lord  our God gives to us by lot all the days. And you shall inherit and dwell in it.

32. And you shall guard  to do all  his orders, and  these judgments, which I give in your presence today.  

## Deuteronomy 12

1.  Instructions When Entering the Land And these are the orders and the judgments, which you shall guard  to do in the land of which the lord the God  of your fathers gives to you by lot, all the days of which you live upon the land.

2. By destruction you shall destroy all the places in which [3serve 4there 1the 2nations]  their gods, whose lands you shall inherit them upon the [2mountains  1high], and upon the hills, and underneath every [2tree 1bushy].

3. And you shall raze  their shrines, and break  their monuments; and  [2their sacred groves 1you shall cut down]; and the carvings  of their gods you shall incinerate by fire; and you shall destroy  their names from out of  that place.

4. You shall not do so with the lord  your God.

5. But in the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] from all  of your tribes to name  his name there, and to be called upon -- even you shall seek after and enter there. 

6.  Instructions Concerning Offerings And you shall bring there the whole burnt-offerings of yours, and  your sacrifices, and  your tenths, and  your vow offerings, and  your voluntary offerings, and  your acknowledgment offerings, the first-born  of your oxen, and  of your sheep.

7. And you shall eat there before the lord  your God, and you shall be glad in all the things of which ever you should put  your hands, you and  your houses, in so far as [3blessed 4you 1the lord  2your God].

8. You shall not do according to all as many as we do here today -- each doing the pleasing thing before him.

9. [3not 1For 2you have] come unto the present time for the rest and for the inheritance which the lord  our God gives you.

10. But you shall pass over the Jordan, and you shall dwell upon the land of which the lord  our God shall inherit to you; and he shall rest you from all  your enemies  round about; and you shall dwell with safety.

11. And there will be the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] [2to be called upon  1his name] there -- there you shall bring all as many things as I give charge to you today;  your whole burnt-offerings, and  your sacrifices, and  your tithes, and the first-fruits  of your hands, and every choice thing  of your gifts, as many as you should vow to the lord.

12. And you shall be glad before the lord  your God, you and  your sons, and  your daughters, and  your manservants, and  your maidservants, and the Levite  at  your gates; for there is not to him a portion nor lot with you.

13. Take heed to yourself that you should not offer  of your whole burnt-offerings in any place of which ever you should behold,

14. but only in the place which [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] it, in one  of your cities -- there you shall offer  your whole burnt-offerings, and there you shall do all as many things as I give charge to you today.

15. But in all your desire you shall sacrifice and shall eat meats according to the blessing of the lord  your God which he gave to you in every city -- the unclean among you, and the clean [3the same 1shall eat 2it], as a doe or stag.

16. Except the blood you shall not eat upon the land; you shall pour it out as water.

17. You shall not be able to eat in  your cities the tithe  of your grain, and  your wine, and  your olive oil, the first-born  of your oxen, and  of your sheep, and all the vows, as many as you should have vowed, and  your acknowledgment offerings, and the first-fruits  of your hands.

18. But only before the lord  your God shall you eat them in the place in which ever [4should choose 1the lord  2your God 3himself] for you and  your son and  your daughter,  your manservant and  your maidservant, and the Levite, and the foreigner  in  your cities. And you shall be glad before the lord  your God over all of whatsoever you should put [2upon  1your hand].

19. Take heed to yourself! that you should not abandon the Levite all the time, as much as  you should live upon the land.

20. And if [3should widen 1the lord  2your God]  your borders, just as he spoke to you, and you shall say, I will eat meats; if [2should desire  1your soul] so as to eat meats, in every desire  of your soul, you shall eat meats.

21. And if at a farther distance from you be the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] to call upon  his name there, then you shall sacrifice from  your oxen, and from  your sheep what ever [3should give 4to you 1the lord  2your God], in which manner I gave charge to you; and you shall eat in  your cities according to the desire  of your soul.

22. As [6are eaten 1the 2doe 3and 4the 5stag], so shall you eat it; the unclean among you, and the clean [2likewise 1shall eat it].

23. Take heed strongly!  to not eat blood, for  its blood is life. You shall not eat life with the meats.

24. You shall not eat blood; upon the earth you shall pour it out as water.

25. You shall not eat it, that good should happen to you, and to your sons after you, if you should do the good and the pleasing thing before the lord  your God.

26. Except  your holy things, which ever should come to you, and  [2your vow offerings 1taking], you shall come into the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] [2to be called upon  1his name] there.

27. And there you shall offer  your whole burnt-offerings; the meats you shall offer upon the altar of the lord  your God; but the blood  of your sacrifices you shall pour towards the base of the altar of the lord  your God, but the meats you may eat.

28. Guard and hearken! and you shall do all the words which I give charge to you, that good should happen to you, and to your sons through the eon, if you should do the pleasing and the good thing before the lord  your God.

29. But if [3should utterly destroy 1the lord  2your God] the nations into which you enter there to inherit  their land from your presence, and you should inherit them, and dwell in  their land;

30. take heed to yourself! you should not seek to follow them after  their being utterly destroyed from your face. In no way should you seek after  their gods, saying, How [2act  1these nations]  with their gods [2shall act 1I also].

31. You shall not do so to the lord your God; for the abominations which the lord detested they did with  their gods; for also  their sons and  their daughters they incinerated in fire to their gods.

32. Every word which I give charge to you today, this you shall guard to do. You shall not add unto it, nor remove from it.  

## Deuteronomy 13

1.  Concerning Prophets And if there should rise up among you a prophet or one dreaming dreams, and he should give to you a sign or miracle,

2. and it should come to pass -- the sign or the miracle which he spoke to you, saying, We should go and serve other gods who we do not know.

3. You shall not hearken to the words  of that prophet, or the one dreaming  that dream; for [3tests 1the lord  2your God] you,  to know, if you love the lord  your God from [2entire  3heart 1your] and from [2entire  3soul 1your].

4. [2after 3the lord  4your God 1You shall go], and him you shall fear, and  his commandments you shall keep, and  his voice you shall hearken to, and to him you shall serve, and to him you shall be added to.

5. And  that prophet, or  [3the 4dream 2dreaming 1that one] shall die; for he spoke to cause you to wander from the lord  your God (the one leading you from the land of Egypt,  ransoming you from  slavery) to push you from the way of which [3gave charge 4to you 1the lord  2your God] to go by it. And you shall remove  [2wicked thing 3from 4you 1their]. 

6.  The Abomination of Serving Other Gods But if there should enjoin you,  your brother from your father, or from your mother, or  of your son, or  of your daughter, or  of your wife, or one in  your bosom, or  [3friend 1your  2equal] to your soul, in private saying, We should go and should serve other gods which neither [4know 1you 2nor  3your fathers],

7. of the gods of the nations  surrounding you, of the ones near to you, or of the ones far from you, from the uttermost part of the earth, unto the uttermost part of the earth;

8. you shall not acquiesce to him, and you shall not hear him, and you shall not spare  your eye upon him, and you shall not show mercy upon him, nor shall you shelter him.

9. Announcing, you shall announce concerning him, and  your hand shall be upon him as first to kill him, and the hand of all the people upon him last.

10. And they shall throw stones at him with stones, and he shall die; for he sought to abstain you from the lord  your God, the one leading you from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.

11. And all Israel hearing, shall fear, and shall not add to do again according to  [2matter  1this wicked] among you.

12. And if it should be heard in one  of your cities, which the lord  your God gives to you for you to dwell there, saying,

13. [3came forth 1Men 2lawbreakers] from you, and left all the ones dwelling in their city, saying, We should go and serve other gods, which you did not know;

14. then you shall examine, and shall ask, and shall search exceedingly; and behold, [4true 3be clearly 1if the 2word 7has taken place  6abomination 5that this] among you;

15. then by doing away with, you shall do away with all the ones dwelling in  that city by carnage of the sword; under anathema you shall devote it to consumption, and all the things in it, and all  its cattle by the mouth of the sword.

16. And all  its spoils you shall bring together into  its corridors, and you shall burn the city by fire, and all  its spoils in full assembly before the lord  your God; and it shall be uninhabited into the eon; it shall not be rebuilt again.

17. And you shall not cleave to anything of that being offered up for consumption as anathema in  your hand so that the lord should be turned away from the rage  of his anger, and should grant to you mercy, and should show mercy on you, and should multiply you in which manner the lord swore by an oath to your fathers;

18. if you should hearken to the voice of the lord  your God, to guard all  his commandments, which I give charge to you today, to do the good and the pleasing thing before the lord  your God.  

## Deuteronomy 14

1.  Clean and Unclean Animals You are sons of the lord  your God. You shall not make baldness between  your eyes for the dead.

2. For [3people 2a holy 1you are] to the lord  your God, and [3chose you 1the lord  2your God] to become  [3people 1his 2prized] of all the nations of the ones upon the face of the earth.

3. You shall not eat any abomination.

4. These are the cattle which you shall eat -- the calf of the oxen, and a lamb of the sheep, and a young he-goat of the goats,

5. the stag, and doe, and roebuck, and antelope, and white-tailed hart, and gazelle, and cameleopard.

6. Every beast cloven hoof, and cloven-footed to claw with two claws, and embarks chewing the cud among the cattle, these you shall eat.

7. And these you shall not eat -- from of the ones embarking chewing the cud, and of the ones being cloven of the hoofs, and clawing cloven-footed -- the camel, and hare, and hyrax -- for they embark chewing the cud, but the hoof is not cloven, these are unclean to you.

8. And the pig, for [2is cloven 3of hoof 1this one], and claws cloven-footed of hoof, but this one as far as chewing the cud does not chew the cud -- this one is unclean to you; from  their meats you shall not eat, and  of their decaying flesh you shall not touch.

9. And these you shall eat from all the ones in the waters -- all as much as there are [4on 5them 1fins 2and 3scales] you shall eat.

10. And all as much as there is not [4to them 1fins 2and 3scales] you shall not eat; [3unclean 1these 2shall be] to you.

11. [2every 4fowl 3clean 1You shall eat].

12. And these you shall not eat of them -- the eagle, and the griffin, and the osprey,

13. and the vulture, and the kite, and the ones likened to it,

14. and every crow and the ones likened to it,

15. and the ostrich, and owl, and gull,

16. and heron, and swan, and ibis,

17. and cormorant, and hawk, and the ones likened to it, and hoopoe, and long-eared owl,

18. and pelican, and curlew, and the ones likened to it, and the purple-legged stork, and bat.

19. All the crawling things of the winged creatures -- [3unclean 1these 2are] to you, you shall not eat from them.

20. Every winged creature being clean you shall eat.

21. Any decaying flesh you shall not eat. To the foreigner  in  your cities it shall be given, and he shall eat it; or you shall render it to the alien. For [3people 2a holy 1you are] to the lord  your God. You shall not boil a lamb in the milk of his mother.

22. A tenth you shall tithe of all [2produce  3of seed 1your], the produce  of your field year by year.

23. And you shall eat it before the lord  your God in the place in which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] [2to be called upon  1his name] there. You shall bring the tithes  of your grain, and  of your wine, and  of your olive oil, and the first-born  of your oxen, and  of your sheep, that you should learn to fear the lord  your God all the days.

24. And if [4far 3should be 1the 2journey] from you, and you should not be able to offer them, because [3is far 4from 5you 1the 2place] which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] [2to be called upon  1his name] there, that [3shall bless 4you 1the lord  2your God];

25. then you shall render for them of silver, and you shall take the silver in  your hands, and you shall go to the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] it.

26. And you shall give the silver for all, of what ever [2should desire  1your soul], for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for liquor, or for any thing of which ever [2should desire  1your soul]. And you shall eat there before the lord  your God. And you shall be glad, you and  your house.

27. And the Levite  in  your cities -- you shall not abandon him, for there is not to him a portion nor a lot with you.

28. After three years you shall bring forth every  tenth  of your produce; in  that year you shall place it in  your cities.

29. And [3shall come 1the 2Levite], for there is no portion for him nor lot with you, and the foreigner, and the orphan, and the widow  in  your cities, and they shall eat and shall be filled; that [3should bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in all the works  of your hands, in whichever ones you should do.  

## Deuteronomy 15

1.  Release of Loans For seven years you shall make a release.

2. And thus is the order of the release. You shall cancel every [2loan 1private], the one which [3owes 4to you 1your 2neighbor]. And  [3of your brother 1you shall not 2exact payment], for it has been called a release to the lord  your God.

3. The alien -- you shall exact as much as might be due you from him;  but [3for your brother 2a release 1you shall make]  of your loan.

4. For there shall not be among you one lacking; for by a blessing [3shall bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot to inherit it.

5. But if in hearing you should hearken to the voice of the lord  your God, to guard and to do all  these commandments which I give charge to you today,

6. for the lord  your God blessed you in which manner he spoke to you; then you shall lend [2nations 1to many], but you shall not borrow; and you shall control [2nations 1many], but of you they shall not control. 

7.  Care for the Brethren And if there should be among you one lacking from  your brethren in one  of your cities in the land which the lord  your God gives to you, you shall not disregard  your heart, nor in any way close  your hand from  your brother -- the one wanting.

8. In opening, you shall open  your hands to him, and [2a loan 1you shall lend] to him as much as he wants, and according to as much as he lacks.

9. Take heed to yourself! there be not [2thing 1a hidden] in  your heart, a violation of the law, saying, [4approaches 1The 3year  2seventh], the year of the release; and [2should be wicked  1your eye] towards your brother that is wanting, that you should not give to him; and he shall call to aid against you to the lord, and there shall be in you [2sin 1a great].

10. Giving, you shall give to him, and [3a loan 1you shall lend 2to him] as much as he wants of you. And you shall not fret in your heart of your giving to him, for on account of  this matter [3will bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in all  your works, and in all things of which ever you should put  your hand to.

11. For in no way should [2fail 1the one lacking] from  your land. Because of this I give charge to you to do  this thing, saying, In opening, you shall open  your hands to [3brother 1your  2needy], and to the one wanting  upon  your land.

12. And if [3should be sold 4to you  1your brother  2a Hebrew man], or the Hebrew woman, he shall serve to you six years, and the seventh you shall send him free from you.

13. And whenever you should send him free from you, you shall not send him empty.

14. With supplies you shall provide him from  your sheep, and from  your grain, and from  your wine vat. As [3blessed 4you 1the lord  2your God] you shall give to him.

15. And you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and [3ransomed 4you 1the lord  2your God] from there. On account of this I give charge to you to do  this thing.

16. But if he should say to you, I shall not go forth from you, for he loves you, and  your house, for it is good to him to be by you;

17. then you shall take the shoemaker's awl, and make a hole  in his ear against the door, and he will be to you a servant into the eon. And  of your maidservant you shall do likewise.

18. [2not 4hard 1It shall 3be] before you sending them free from you, for the yearly wage of the hireling -- he served to you six years. And [3shall bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in all what ever you should do.

19. Every first-born which ever should give birth among  your oxen, and among  your sheep, [2the 3males 1you shall sanctify] to the lord  your God. You shall not work with  [2first-born 3calf 1your], and in no way should you shear the first-born  of your sheep.

20. Before the lord  your God you shall eat it year by year, in the place in which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] -- you and  your house.

21. And if there might be in it a blemish -- lame or blind, or even any [2blemish 1severe], you shall not sacrifice it to the lord  your God.

22. In  your cities you shall eat it. The unclean in you and the clean likewise shall eat as the doe or stag.

23. Except  its blood you shall not eat; [3upon 4the 5ground 1you shall pour 2it] as water.  

## Deuteronomy 16

1.  Concerning Passover Guard the month of the new corn! And you shall observe the passover to the lord  your God, for in the month of the new corn [3led 4you 1the lord  2your God] out of Egypt by night.

2. And you shall sacrifice the passover to the lord  your God -- sheep and oxen in the place in which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God 5to be called upon  4his name] there.

3. You shall not eat it with yeast; seven days you shall eat it with unleavened breads, bread of affliction; for in haste you came forth from out of Egypt at night; that you should remember the day  of your departure from out of the land of Egypt all the days  of your life.

4. There shall not be seen by you any yeast in all  your boundaries for seven days, and you shall not go to bed with any of the meats, which ever you should have sacrificed in the evening, left over the [2day  1first] in the morning.

5. You shall not be able to sacrifice the passover in any one  of your cities which the lord  your God gives to you;

6. but only in the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God 5to be called upon  4his name] there. You shall sacrifice the passover at evening towards the descent of the sun, in the time which you came forth from out of the land of Egypt.

7. And you shall boil, and bake, and eat in the place in which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] it. And you shall return in the morning and go to  your houses.

8. Six days you shall eat unleavened breads, and the [2day  1seventh] is a recess holiday to the lord  your God; you shall not do on it any work except as much as shall be done for your life. 

9.  Holiday of Sevens Seven [2periods of seven 1entire] you shall count out to yourself; with the beginning of your sickle upon the harvest you shall begin to count out seven periods of seven.

10. And you shall observe the holiday of the period of sevens to the lord  your God, as  your hand is strong, in as much as [3should give 4to you 5in so far as 6he blessed 7you 1the lord  2your God].

11. And you shall be glad before the lord  your God, you and  your son and  your daughter,  your manservant, and  your maidservant, and the Levite  in  your cities, and the foreigner, and the orphan, and the widow  among you, in the place in which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] [2to be called upon  1his name] there.

12. And you shall remember that [2a servant 1you were] in the land of Egypt. And you shall guard and observe  these commandments. 

13.  Holiday of Tents The holiday of tents you shall observe to yourself seven days, in  your bringing from  your threshing-floor, and from  your wine vat.

14. And you shall be glad in  your holiday, you and  your son, and  your daughter,  your manservant, and  your maidservant, and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the orphan, and the widow  being in  your cities.

15. Seven days you shall solemnize a holiday to the lord  your God in the place in which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] for himself. But if [3should bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in all  your offspring, and in every work  of your hands, then you shall be glad.

16. Three times of the year [4shall appear 1every 2male 3of yours] before the lord  your God in the place in which ever [2should have chosen 1the lord] in the holiday of the unleavened breads, and in the holiday of the period of sevens, and in the holiday of the pitching of tents. You shall not appear in the presence of the lord  your God empty.

17. Each offering according to the power  of your hands; according to the blessing of the lord  your God which he gave to you.

18. Judges and judicial recorders you shall ordain to yourself in all  your cities, which the lord  your God gives to you according to tribes. And they shall judge the people [2judgment 1with just].

19. They shall not turn aside a judgment, they shall not discriminate a person, nor shall they take bribes; for the bribes make blind the eyes of the wise, and lift away the words of the just.

20. Justly  [2justice 1you shall pursue], that you should live, and entering you should inherit the land which the lord  your God gives to you.

21. You shall not plant for yourself a sacred grove; any tree by the altar of the lord  your God you shall not produce for yourself.

22. You shall not set up for yourself a monument which [3detests 1the lord  2your God].  

## Deuteronomy 17

1.  Concerning Judicial Judgments You shall not sacrifice to the lord  your God a calf or sheep in which there is in it a blemish, any thing in a sorry state, for [2an abomination 3to the lord  4your God 1it is].

2. But if there should be among you, in one  of your cities which the lord  your God gives to you, a man or woman who shall do the wicked thing before the lord  your God, to pass by  his covenant,

3. and going forth should serve other gods, and should do obeisance to them -- to the sun, or the moon, or to any of the ones of the cosmos of the heaven, which I assigned not;

4. and it should be announced to you, and you heard, and you sought exceedingly, and behold, if truly [3has happened 1the 2thing] [2came to pass  1that this abomination] in Israel;

5. then you shall lead out  that man or  that woman, (the ones who made  [2order  1this wicked],) unto the gate. And you shall stone them with stones, and they shall come to an end.

6. By two witnesses or three witnesses one shall die. The one dying shall not die by one witness.

7. And the hand of the witnesses shall be upon him among the first to put him to death, and the hand of all of the people upon him last. And you shall lift away the wicked thing [2from 3you 1of them].

8. But if [4should be powerless 5for 6you to decide 1a matter 2in 3a judgment], between blood and blood, and between judgment and judgment, and between blow and blow, and between dispute and dispute, for matters of judgment in  your cities; then rising up you shall ascend unto the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God 5to be called upon  4for his name] there.

9. And you shall come to the priests of the Levites, and to the judge, who ever happens to be in  those days; and seeking after the matter they shall announce to you the judgment.

10. And you shall do according to the thing, which ever they should announce to you from the place of which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God]. And you shall guard exceedingly to do according to all as much as the law should be established to you.

11. According to the law, and according to the judgment, which ever they should tell to you, thus you shall do it. You shall not turn aside from the matter of which ever they should announce to you, right nor left.

12. And the man who ever should do in pride  to not obey the priest  standing beside to officiate in the name of the lord  your God, or the judge who ever should be in  those days, then [2shall die  1that man], and you shall lift away the wicked one from out of Israel.

13. And all the people hearing shall fear, and shall not be impious any more. 

14.  Concerning Rulers And whenever you should enter into the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot, and you should inherit it, and should dwell upon it, and you should say, I shall place over myself a ruler, as also the rest of the nations  round about me;

15. then in placing, you shall place over yourself a ruler, which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] -- him from out of  your brethren you shall place over yourself as ruler. You shall not be able to place over yourself [2man 1an alien], for [2not 3your brother 1he is].

16. Furthermore he shall not multiply to himself a cavalry, nor shall he return the people to Egypt, so that he should not multiply to himself a cavalry. For the lord said to you, You shall not add to return  this way any more.

17. And he shall not multiply to himself wives, that he shall not change over his  heart. And silver and gold he shall not multiply to himself exceedingly.

18. And it will be whenever he shall be settled in the chair  of his office, then he shall write for himself  this second book of the law into a scroll by the hands of the priests of the Levites.

19. And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days  of his life; that he should learn to fear the lord  his God, to guard all  these commandments, and  [2these ordinances 1to do];

20. that [2should not 3be raised up high  1his heart] above  his brethren; that he should not transgress from the commandments, right or left; so that he should be a long time in  his office -- he and  his sons among the sons of Israel.  

## Deuteronomy 18

1.  Concerning Levites There will not be to the priests, to the Levites, the entire tribe of Levi, a portion nor a lot with Israel. The yield offerings of the lord  are their lot -- they shall eat them.

2. [4a lot 1And 2there will not 3be] to him among  his brethren; the lord himself is his lot, in so far as he said to him.

3. And this is the distinguishing thing of the priests -- the things from the people, from the ones sacrificing the sacrifices, if both a calf, or if also a sheep -- that you shall give the shoulder to the priest, and the jawbones, and the large intestine,

4. and the first-fruits  of your grain, and  of your wine, and  of your olive oil; and the first-fruit of the shearing  of your sheep you shall give to him:

5. for [3chose him 1the lord  2your God] from out of all  your tribes, to stand before the lord  God, to officiate in the name of the lord, he and  his sons all the days.

6. And if [3should come 1the 2Levite] from one  of your cities of all the sons of Israel, of which he himself sojourns, that [2desires  1his soul], into the place which ever the lord should choose;

7. then he shall officiate in the name of the lord  his God, as all  his brethren the Levites, the ones standing there before the lord.

8. [2a portion 3having been portioned 1He shall eat], besides the sale of the things of his family. 

9.  Abomination of the Nations And whenever you should enter into the land which the lord  your God gives to you, you shall not learn to do according to the abominations  of those nations.

10. There shall not be found in you one purging  his son or  his daughter in fire, or one using oracles for divination, or one prognosticating and foretelling,

11. an administer of potions, one charming an enchantment, one who delivers oracles, and an observer of signs asking of the dead.

12. [5is 1For 6an abomination 7to the lord  8your God 2every one 3doing 4these things]. For because of  these abominations the lord  your God shall utterly destroy them from your face.

13. You shall be perfect before the lord  your God.

14.  For these nations which you inherit them, these [2prognostications 3and 4divinations 1shall hear]; but to you [3did not 4so 5give 1the lord  2your God]. 

15.  Concerning Prophets A prophet from out of  your brethren, as me, [3shall raise up 4to you 1the lord  2your God]; him you shall hear.

16. According to all as much as you asked of the lord  your God in Horeb, in the day of the assembly, saying, We shall not add to hear the voice of the lord  your God, and  [3fire 1this  2great] we shall not see any longer, nor shall we die.

17. And the lord said to me, Rightly all as much as they spoke.

18. [2a prophet 1I shall raise up] to them from amidst  their brethren, as you, and I shall put  my word in  his mouth; and he shall speak to them in so far as I give charge to him.

19. And the man who ever should not hear  his words, as many as [3should 4speak 1the 2prophet] in  my name, I shall exact punishment from him.

20. Except the prophet, who ever should be impious to speak a word in  my name, which I did not assign to him to speak, and who ever should speak in the name of other gods, [2shall die  1that prophet].

21. But if you should say in  your heart, How shall we know the word which [2spoke not 1the lord]?

22. As many things as [3should speak 1the 2prophet] in the name of the lord, and [3should not 4take place 1the 2thing], and [3should not 4come to pass 1this  2thing] which [2spoke not 1the lord]; through impiety [3spoke 1the 2prophet]; you shall not receive from him.  

## Deuteronomy 19

1.  Cities of Refuge But whenever [3should remove from view 1the lord  2your God] the nations which  your God gives to you  of their land, and you should inherit them, and should dwell in  their cities, and in  their houses;

2. [3three 4cities 1you shall draw apart 2to yourself] in the midst  of your land, which the lord  your God gives to you.

3. Take thought to yourself of the way, and you shall make three parts the boundaries  of your land which [3divides 4to you 1the lord  2your God], and it will be there for a refuge to every man-slayer.

4. And this will be the order for the man-slayer, who ever should flee there, and shall live -- who ever should strike  his neighbor unintentionally, and this one was not detesting him before  yesterday and before the third day.

5. And who ever should enter with the neighbor into the oak grove to bring wood, and [2was knocked back  1his hand] with the axe while felling the wood, and [3in falling off 1the 2iron implement] from the wood handle should happen by chance to strike the neighbor, and he should die; this one shall take refuge in one  of these cities, and shall live.

6.  Lest [4pursue 1the one 2acting as next of kin  3for blood] after the man-slayer, because [2is overheated  1his heart], and overtakes him, if it might be a longer  way, and he strikes his life and he should die. And [4to this man 1there is no 2judgment 3of death], for [2not 3detesting 1he was] him before  yesterday and before the third day.

7. Because of this I give charge to you  this thing, saying, Three cities you shall draw apart to yourself.

8. And if [3should widen 1the lord  2your God]  your borders, in which manner he swore by an oath to your fathers, and [2should give 3to you 1the lord] all the land which he said he would give to your fathers;

9. if you should listen to do all  these commandments which I give charge to you today, to love the lord  your God, to go in all  his ways all the days; then you shall add to yourself again three cities to  these three.

10. And [3shall not 4be poured out 1the blood 2of the innocent] in the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot, and there will not be among you blood liability.

11. But if there should be a man detesting his neighbor, and he shall lie in wait for him, and should rise up against him, and should strike his  life, and he should die, and he should flee into one  of these cities;

12. then they shall send the council of elders  of his city, and they shall take him from there, and shall deliver him into the hands to the one acting as next of kin  for blood, and he shall die.

13. You shall not spare  your eye for him, and you shall cleanse the blood for the innocent from out of Israel, and [2good 3to you 1it will be].

14. You shall not move the boundaries  of your neighbor, which they established, the ones prior of you among  your inheritance, which you inherited in the land, which the lord  your God gives to you by lot. 

15.  Concerning Witnesses You shall not adhere to [2witness 1one] in witnessing against a man for any injustice, and for any sin, and for any sin which ever he should have sinned. By the mouth of two witnesses, and by the mouth of three witnesses [3shall be established 1every 2word].

16. And if [3should stand 2witness 1an unjust] against a man alleging his impiety;

17. then [4shall stand 1the 2two 3men], in which [3is 4with them 1the 2dispute], before the lord, and before the priests, and before the judges -- the ones as might be in  those days.

18. And [3should inquire 1the 2judges] exactly. And behold, [2witness 1if an unjust] witnessed unjustly, and stood against  his brother,

19. then you shall do to him in which manner he devised wickedly to do against  his brother, and you shall lift away the wicked from yourselves.

20. And the rest hearing shall fear, and they shall not add again to do according to  [2thing  1this wicked] among you.

21. [2shall not 3spare  1Your eye]  him; life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot; in so far as any should give a blemish to the neighbor, thus you shall give to him.  

## Deuteronomy 20

1.  Concerning War And if you should go forth to war against  your enemies, and you should behold a horse, and rider, and [2people 1many more] than you, do not be fearful of them! for the lord  your God is with you, the one bringing you from the land of Egypt.

2. And it will be whenever you should approach to the war, that [3drawing near 1the 2priest] shall speak to the people, and shall say to them,

3. Hear, O Israel! You go today to war with  your enemies; do not loosen  your heart; do not fear nor be devastated, nor turn aside from their face!

4. For the lord  your God, the one going forth with you, he shall join in war with you against your enemies, and he shall preserve you.

5. And [3shall speak 1the 2scribes] to the people, saying, Who is the man  building [2house 1a new], and did not dedicate it? Let him go and return to  his house! lest he die in the war, and [2man 1another] shall dedicate it.

6. And Who is the man whoever plants a vineyard, and was not glad from it? Let him go, and let him return to  his house! lest he should die in the war, and [2man 1another] be glad from out of his labor.

7. And who is the man who has espoused a woman, and did not take her? Let him go, and let him return to  his house! lest he die in the war, and [2man 1another] shall take her.

8. And [3shall add 1the 2scribes] to speak to the people, and shall say, Who is the man, the one fearing and timid in the heart? Let him go, and let him return to  his house! that he should not make timid the heart  of his brother, as  he.

9. And it will be whenever [3should cease 1the 2scribes] speaking to the people, that they shall place rulers of the military taking lead of the people.

10. And if you should come forward to a city to wage war against it, that you should call them forth with peace.

11. And it shall be if then they should peaceably answer you, and open to you, it shall be that all the people  being found in it shall be [2to you 1tributaries], and subjects to you.

12. But if they should not obey you, and should make [2against 3you 1war], and you shall besiege it,

13. and [3shall deliver 4it 1the lord  2your God] into  your hands, then you shall strike every male of it by carnage of the sword,

14. except the women and the belongings. And all the cattle, and all as much as exists in the city, and all the chattel you shall despoil for yourself, and you shall eat all the plunder  of your enemy, whom the lord  your God gives to you.

15. Thus you shall do for all the cities  [2far away 1being] from you exceedingly, which are not from the cities  of these nations which the lord  your God gives to you to inherit  their land.

16. But behold, from the cities  of these nations which the lord  your God gives to you to inherit  their land, you shall not take alive any one breathing.

17. But you shall devote them to consumption -- the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and Perizzite, and Hivite, and Jebusite, and Gergesite; in which manner [3gave charge 4to you 1the lord  2your God];

18. that they should not teach you to do all  their abominations, as many as they made unto their gods, that you shall sin before the lord  your God.

19. But if you should besiege around a city [2days 1many] to wage war against it for taking it, you shall not utterly destroy  its trees by putting upon them an iron axe; but of it you shall eat, [3it down 1but 2you shall not cut]; nor is a man [2the 3tree  4in 5the 6grove 1to enter unto] from your presence for the siege mound?

20. But the tree which you know that [2not 3fruit-bearing 1it is], this you shall annihilate, and you shall cut it, and shall build a siege mound at the city, whichever makes [2against 3you  1war], until whenever it should be delivered up.  

## Deuteronomy 21

1.  Priests and Levites as Judicial Mediators And if [2should be found 1a slain person] in the earth (which the lord  your God gives to you to inherit) fallen in the plain, and they do not know the one striking him;

2. there shall come forth  your council of elders, and  your judges, and they shall measure out the distances of the cities  round about the slain person;

3. and it shall be to the city  near to the slain person, that [4shall take 1the 2council of elders  3of that city] a heifer from the oxen, which has not worked, and which did not draw a yoke;

4. and [4shall bring 1the 2council of elders  3of that city] the heifer into [2ravine 1a rough] which has not been worked, nor sowed; and they shall hamstring the heifer in the ravine,

5. and [5shall come forward 1the 2priests 3the 4Levites], for [3chose them 1the lord  2your God] to stand beside him, and to bless over  his name, and by  their mouth will be every dispute and every blow decided.

6. And every one of the council of elders  of that city, the ones approaching the slain person, shall wash their hands over the head of the heifer -- the one being hamstrung in the ravine.

7. And answering they shall say,  Our hands did not pour out  this blood, and  our eyes have not seen it.

8. Let kindness come to your people Israel, whom you ransomed from the land of Egypt, O lord, that there should not be [2blood 1innocent] to  your people Israel. And [3shall be atoned for 4to them 1the 2blood].

9. And you shall lift away the [2blood  1innocent] from you of them, if you should do the good and the pleasing thing before the lord  your God.

10. And whenever you should go forth to war with  your enemies, and [3should deliver them up 1the lord  2your God] into  your hands, that you shall despoil  them by plunder.

11. And should you behold among the spoils a woman good to the sight, and should ponder her, and you should take her to yourself for a wife;

12. then you shall bring her inside into  your house, and you shall shave  her head, and trim her nails;

13. and you shall remove the garments of her captivity from her, and you shall seat her in  your house, and she shall weep over her father and  mother for a month of days; and after this you shall enter to her, and you shall be living together with her, and she shall be your wife.

14. And it shall be if you should not want her, you shall send her free, and for sale you shall not sell her for silver, you shall not disrespect her, for you humbled her.

15. But if there be to a man two wives, one of them being loved, and one of them being detested, and they should bear with him, both the one being loved and the one being detested, and [3is born 2son 1the first-born] of the one being detested,

16. then it shall be in which ever day he should divide by lot to his sons  of his possessions, he shall not be able to give the right of the first-born to the son of the one being loved, overlooking the son of the one being detested -- the first-born.

17. But the first-born son of the one being detested he shall recognize to give to him double from all which ever should be found by him, for this one is [2beginning 3child 1his], and to this one [3is fitting 1the 2rights of the first-born].

18. And if any might have a son resisting persuasion, and an irritant, not obeying the voice of his father, and the voice of his mother, and they should correct him, and he should not listen to them;

19. then [4seizing 5him  1his father 2and  3his mother] then shall lead him to the council of elders  of his city, and unto the gate  of his place.

20. And they shall say to the men  of their city, Our son, this one resists persuasion, and he aggravates, not obeying  our voice; he is fond of carousing drunk with wine.

21. And [4shall stone 5him 1the 2men  3of his city] with stones, and he shall die; and thus you shall lift away the wicked from you of them; and all Israel hearing, they shall be fearful.

22. And if there be [2in 3any 1sin] with the judgment of death upon him, and he should die, and you should hang him upon a tree,

23. [2shall not 3rest  1his body] upon the tree, but by burial you shall entomb him on  that day, for being cursed by God is every one hanging upon a tree; and in no way shall you defile the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot.  

## Deuteronomy 22

1.  Social and Domestic Laws In beholding the calf  of your brother or  of his sheep wandering in the way, do not overlook them; by returning you shall return them to your brother, and you shall give them back to him.

2. And if [2is not 3near  1your brother] to you, nor do you know him, you shall bring them inside into  your house; and it shall be with you until whenever [2should seek 3them  1your brother], and you shall give them back to him.

3. So shall you do  for his donkey, and so you shall do  for his garment, and so you shall do according to all loss  of your brother; as much as should perish of his, and you should find them, you shall not be able to overlook.

4. You shall not see the donkey  of your brother, or  his calf fallen in the way, and not overlook them; by raising you shall raise them up for him.

5. [3shall not 4be 1The items 2of a man] upon a woman, nor should [2put on 1a man 4apparel 3feminine], for [5an abomination 6to the lord  7your God 4is 1every one 2doing 3these things].

6. And if you should meet with a nest of birds before your face in the way, or upon any tree, or upon the ground -- young chicks or eggs, and the mother should be incubating upon the young, or upon the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the offspring.

7. By discharge you shall send off the mother, but the offspring you shall take to yourself; that [2good 3for you 1it should be], and [2of many days 1you shall be].

8. And if you should build [2house 1a new], then you shall make a rim  for your roof, and you will not cause carnage in  your house if should fall  one falling from it.

9. You shall not scatter abroad  your vineyard diverse seed, that [3should not 4be sanctified 1the 2produce], and the seed which ever you should sow with the produce  of your vineyard.

10. You shall not plow with a calf and donkey upon the same yoke.

11. You shall not put on commingled wool and flax upon the same garment.

12. A twisted fringe you shall make for yourself upon the four decorative hems  of your wrap-around garments, which ever you should put around yourself by them.

13. And if any should take a wife, and should live with her, and should detest her,

14. and should place upon her [2offered as an excuse 1words], and should bring upon her [2name 1a bad], and should say,  [3woman 2this 1I took], and drawing near to her, I did not find her tokens of virginity.

15. And taking, the father of the child and the mother, they shall bring forth the tokens of the virginity of the child to the council of elders at the gate.

16. And [5shall say 1the 2father 3of the 4child] to the council of elders,  [2daughter 3of mine 1This] I gave  to this man as wife, and he is detesting her.

17. He now places upon her [2offered as an excuse 1words], saying, I did not find  [2of your daughter 1tokens of virginity]; and these are the tokens of virginity  of my daughter. And they shall unfold the garment worn by her before the council of elders of the city.

18. And [4shall take 1the 2council of elders  3of that city]  that man, and they shall correct him,

19. and shall penalize him a hundred shekels, and shall give them to the father of the young woman, because he brought [2name 1a bad] upon an Israelite virgin, and she shall be his wife; he shall not be able to send her away  at any time.

20. But if in truth [2be  1this word], and [2should not 3be found 1tokens of virginity] to the young woman;

21. then they shall lead the young woman unto the doors  [2house  1of her father's], and [4shall stone 5her 6with stones 1the 2men  3of her city], and she shall die; for she did folly among the sons of Israel, to fornicate the house  of her father. And you shall lift away the wicked from yourselves of them.

22. And if [2should be found 1a man] going to bed with a wife living with a husband, you shall kill both, the man  going to bed with the wife, and the wife; and you shall lift away the wickedness from Israel.

23. And if there be [2child 1a virgin] being espoused to a man, and [2finding 3her 1a man] in the city should have gone to bed with her;

24. you shall lead out both unto the gate  of their city, and they shall be stoned with stones, and they shall die; the young woman, for she did not yell out in the city; and the man, for he humbled the wife  of his neighbor; and you shall lift away the evil from yourselves of them.

25. But if in a plain [2should find 1a man]  a girl,  being espoused; and using force should go to bed with her, you shall kill the man, the one going to bed with her only;

26. for the young woman shall not do anything, there is no [3to the 4young woman 1sin 2worthy of death]. For as if any [2should rise up 1man] against  his neighbor, and should do murder taking his life, thus  this thing,

27. for in the field he found her; [4yelled 1the 2young woman  3being espoused], and was there no one  helping her.

28. And if any should find the [2child  1virgin], whoever was not espoused, and using force on her, he went to bed with her, and he should be found,

29. [6shall give 1the 2man  3going to bed 4with 5her] to the father of the young woman fifty double-drachmas of silver, and she will be his wife, because he humbled her; he will not be able to send her away  at any time.

30. [2shall not 3take 1A man] the wife  of his father, and shall not uncover the marriage veil  of his father.  

## Deuteronomy 23

1.  Social Laws [2shall not enter 1One with crushed testicles] (nor being cut off) into the assembly of the lord.

2. [3shall not enter 1One born of 2a harlot] into the assembly of the lord unto the tenth generation.

3. [4shall not 5enter 1The Ammonite 2and 3Moabite] into the assembly of the lord; even unto the tenth generation he shall not enter into the assembly of the lord, even unto into the eon,

4. for reason  [2not 3meeting with 1of their] you with bread loaves and water in the way, of your going forth from Egypt; and that they hired against you  Balaam son of Beor from out of  Mesopotamia to curse you.

5. And [3did not 4want 1the lord  2your God] to listen to  Balaam; and [3converted 1the lord  2your God] the curses into a blessing, for [3loved 4you 1\Eit the  2your God].

6. You shall not address peaceable to them, nor be advantageous to them all  your days into the eon.

7. You shall not abhor an Edomite, for [2your brother 1he is]. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, for [2a sojourner 1you were] in  his land.

8. [3sons 1If 2they shall bear] to themselves [2generation 1in the third], they shall enter into the assembly of the lord.

9. And if you should go forth to camp against  your enemies, then you shall guard from every evil thing.

10. If there might be among you a man who is not clean because of his flow by night, then he shall go forth outside the camp, and he shall not enter into the camp.

11. And it will be  towards evening he shall bathe  his body in water; and at the going down of the sun, he shall enter into the camp.

12. And a place will be for you outside the camp, and you shall go forth there outside,

13. and a trowel will be  upon  your belt, and it will be whenever you should sit separately outside, that you shall dig with it, and bringing it you shall cover  your indecency by it.

14. For the lord  your God walks about in  your camp to rescue you, and to deliver up  your enemy before your face; and [2shall be  1your camp] holy, and there shall not be seen among you [2of indecency 1a thing], that he shall turn away from you.

15. You shall not deliver up a servant to his master, who was added to you by  his master;

16. [2with 3you 1he shall dwell], among you, in every place of which ever it should please him. You shall not afflict him.

17. There shall not be a harlot from the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be one whoring from the sons of Israel.

18. You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, nor the price of a dog, into the house of the lord  your God for any vow. For [4an abomination 5to the lord  6your God 3are 1even 2both].

19. You shall not lend to your brother with interest of silver, and interest of foods, and interest of any thing of which ever you should lend.

20. To the alien you may lend with interest, but to your brother you shall not lend with interest; that [3should bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in all  your works upon the land into which you enter there to inherit it.

21. And if you shall vow a vow to the lord  your God, you shall not pass time to give it; for requiring, [3shall require it 1the lord  2your God] from you; and it will be [2to 3you 1sin].

22. But if you should not want to make a vow, it is not a sin to you.

23. The things going forth through  your lips you shall guard, and you shall do in which manner you made a vow to the lord  your God in the matter of a gift which [2spoke  1your mouth].

24. And if you enter into the vineyard  of your neighbor, you may eat [2grape 1as much 4your soul 3as to fill up], [3into 1but 4a container 2you shall not put them].

25. And if you should enter into the harvest field  of your neighbor, then you may collect together [2in  3your hands 1corn]; but the sickle in no way shall be put upon the harvest  of your neighbor.  

## Deuteronomy 24

1.  Social and Domestic Laws And if any take a woman and should live with her, and it shall be if she should not find favor before him, for he finds in her an indecent thing, then he shall write to her [2scroll 1a certificate of divorce], and he shall put it into  her hands, and he shall send her from out of  his house.

2. And going forth, should she become [2man's wife 1another],

3. and [4should detest 5her  3husband 1the 2last], and should write to her [2scroll 1certificate of divorce], and he should put it into  her hands, and send her from out of  his house; or [4should die  3husband 1her  2last] who took her to himself as wife;

4. [6shall not be able  3husband 1the 2former  4sending 5her out] to return to take her to himself for a wife after  her being defiled; for it is an abomination before the lord  your God, and you shall not defile the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot.

5. And if any should take a wife recently, he shall not go forth to war, and not [3shall be put upon 4him 1one 2thing] -- he shall be innocent in  his house, [2year 1for one] he shall make glad  his wife whom he took.

6. You shall not take for security a millstone nor an upper millstone, for [3a life 1this one 2takes] for security.

7. And if you should capture a man stealing the life of  his brethren of the sons of Israel, and tyrannizing him to sell him; [3shall die  2thief 1that]; and you shall lift away the evil from yourselves of them.

8. Take heed to yourself in the infection  of leprosy! You shall guard exceedingly to do according to all the law which ever [5should announce 6to you 1the 2priests 3the 4Levites], in which manner I gave charge to you to guard to do.

9. Remember as much as [3did 1the lord  2your God]  to Miriam! in the way of your going forth from Egypt.

10. And if a debt might be owed by  your neighbor, any debt whatsoever, you shall not enter into  his house to take for security  of his item for security.

11. [2outside 1You shall stand], and the man of whom  your debt is in, he shall bring forth to you the item of security outside.

12. But if the man should be in need, you shall not go to bed with  his item of security.

13. By restitution you shall give back to him  his item of security towards the descent of the sun, and he shall go to bed in  his garment, and he will bless you; and it will be to you charity before the lord  your God.

14. You shall not disregard the wage of the needy and one lacking from  your brethren, or of the foreigners, of the ones in  your cities.

15. Daily you shall give him  his wage, [3shall not 4set 1the 2sun] upon him, for he is needy, and in it he has  hope; and he shall not yell out against you to the lord, and thus it will be to you a sin.

16. [2shall not 3die 1Fathers] for the children, and the sons shall not die for the fathers; each for  his own sin shall die.

17. You shall not turn aside a judgment of a foreigner, and an orphan, and a widow; and you shall not take for security a garment of a widow.

18. And you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and [3ransomed 4you 1the lord  2your God] from there. On account of this I give charge to you to do  this thing.

19. And if you should reap  your harvest in  your field, and you should forget a sheaf in  your field, you shall not turn back to take it; for to the poor, and to the foreigner, and to the orphan, and to the widow it will be; that [3should bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in every work  of your hands.

20. And if one should pick olives, you shall not turn back to glean  after you; [2to the 3foreigner 4and 5to the 6orphan 7and 8to the 9widow 1it shall be].

21. And whenever you should gather the vintage  of your vineyard, you shall not glean the things after you; [2for the 3foreigner 4and 5the 6orphan 7and 8the 9widow 1it will be].

22. And you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt. On account of this I give charge to you to do  this thing.  

## Deuteronomy 25

1.  Social and Marital Laws And if there be a dispute between men, and they should come forward for judgment, and they should judge, and should do justice for the just, and should condemn the impious;

2. then it will be if [4worthy 3might be 5of strokes 1the 2one being impious], they shall sit him before the judges, and they shall whip him before them according to  his impiety.

3. [4in number 3forty stripes 1They shall whip 2him], they shall not add more; but if he should add to whip him above these, by the strokes being more you shall be disgraced  of your brother before you.

4. You shall not muzzle an ox threshing.

5. And if [2should dwell 1brethren] in the same place, and [4should die 1one 2of 3them], [4seed 1and 2there might not 3be] to him, [5shall not be 1the 2wife 3of the one 4having died] outside the husband's family not near. The brother  of her husband shall enter to her, and he shall take her to himself as wife, and he shall live with her.

6. And it will be, that the male child, who ever she should give birth to, shall be ordained from the name of the one coming to an end, and [2shall not 3be wiped away  1his name] from out of Israel.

7. But if [3does not 4want 1the 2man] to take the wife  of his brother; then [3shall ascend 1the 2woman] unto the gate to the council of elders, and shall say, [4does not 5want 1The 2brother  3of my husband] to raise up the name  of his brother in Israel -- [4does not 5want to 1the 2brother  3of my husband].

8. And [4shall call 5him 1the 2council of elders  3of that city], and they shall speak to him. And standing, should he say, I am not willing to take her;

9. then [4coming forward 1the 2wife  3of his brother] to him, before the council of elders, then shall untie  his sandal, the one from  his foot, and shall spit into  his face; and responding she shall say, Thus shall they do to the man who shall not build the house  of his brother.

10. And [2shall be called  1his name] in Israel, House of the Untied  Sandal.

11. And if [3should do combat 1two 2men] at the same time -- a man against  his brother; and should come forward the wife of one of them to rescue  her husband from out of the hand of the one beating him, and stretching out  her hand should take hold of  his twins,

12. you shall cut off  her hand; [2shall not 3spare  1your eye] over her. 

13.  True and Just Weights There shall not be in  your money bag a weight and a weight -- a great or small.

14. There shall not be in  your house a measure and a measure -- a great or a small.

15. [6weight 3a true 4and 5just 1There shall be 2to you], and [6measure 3a true 4and 5just 1there shall be 2to you], that [2many days 1you should be] upon the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot.

16. For it is an abomination to the lord  your God every one doing these things -- every one doing unjustly.

17. Remember as many things [2did 3to you 1Amalek] in the way of your going forth from Egypt!

18. How he opposed you in the way, and beat your  rear guard, the ones tiring in your rear, and you hungered and were tired. And he feared not  God.

19. And it will be when ever [3rests 4you 1the lord  2your God] from all  your enemies  round about you in the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot to inherit, you shall wipe away the name Amalek from  under the heaven, and in no way should you forget.  

## Deuteronomy 26

1.  First-fruits And it will be whenever you should enter into the land which the lord  your God gives to you by lot to inherit it, and should dwell upon it;

2. that you shall take from the first-fruit of the fruits  of your land, which the lord  your God gives by lot, and you shall put them into a basket, and you shall go into the place which ever [3should choose 1the lord  2your God] to call upon  his name there.

3. And you shall come to the priest, who ever might be in  those days, and you shall say to him, I announce today to the lord  your God, that I have entered into the land which the lord swore by an oath to our fathers to give to us.

4. And [3shall take 1the 2priest] the basket from out of  your hands, and he shall put it before the altar of the lord  your God.

5. And you shall respond and shall say before the lord  your God, [2threw off Syria  1My father], and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with [2in number 1few], and became there into [2nation 1a great] and [2multitude 1a populous].

6. And [3maltreated 4us 1the 2Egyptians], and humbled us, and placed upon us [2works 1hard].

7. And we yelled out to the lord  God  of our fathers, and the lord listened to  our voice, and beheld  our humiliation, and  our trouble, and  our affliction.

8. And [2led 3us 1the lord] out of Egypt with [2strength  1great], and with [2hand 1a fortified], and with [2arm 1a high], and with [2visions 1great], and with signs, and with miracles.

9. And he brought us into  this place, and he gave to us  this land, a land flowing milk and honey.

10. And now, behold, I have brought the first-fruit of the produce of the land which you gave to me, O lord. And you shall leave it before the lord  your God, and you shall do obeisance before the lord  your God.

11. And you shall be glad in all the good things which [3gave 4to you 1the lord  2your God], and to your family, you and the Levite and the foreigner  among you. 

12.  The Tithe And whenever you should complete to tithe all the tenth part of the produce  of your land in the [2year  1third], the second tenth part you shall give to the Levite, and to the foreigner, and to the orphan, and to the widow; and they shall eat in  your cities, and they shall be satisfied.

13. And you shall say before the lord  your God, I cleared the holy things from out of  my house, and I gave them to the Levite, and to the foreigner, and to the orphan, and to the widow, according to all  your commandments which you gave charge to me; I did not pass by  your commandment, and I did not forget.

14. And I did not eat [3in 4my grief 1of 2them]; I did not yield of them in an unclean manner; I did not give of them to the one having died; I obeyed the voice of the lord  my God to do as he gave charge to me.

15. Look down from out of  [2house  1your holy], from  heaven, and bless  your people  Israel! and the land which you gave to them, as you swore by an oath to our fathers, to give to us a land flowing milk and honey!

16. On  this day the lord  your God gave charge to you to do all  these ordinances and  judgments. And you shall guard and observe them from [2entire  3heart 1your], and from [2entire  3soul 1your].

17.  You took God today to be your God, and to go in all  his ways, and to guard the ordinances, and the commandments, and  his judgments, and to obey  his voice.

18. And the lord took you today for you to be to him [2people 1a prized], just as he spoke to you -- for you to guard all  his commandments;

19. and for you to be above all the nations, as he made you famous, and a boasting, and glorious; for you to be [2people 1a holy] to the lord  your God as he spoke.  

## Deuteronomy 27

1.  Stones in the Jordan And [6assigned 1Moses 2and 3the 4council of elders 5of Israel], saying, Guard all the commandments! as many as I give charge to you today.

2. And it will be in which ever day you should pass over the Jordan into the land which the lord  your God gives to you, that you shall set up to yourself [2stones 1great], and you shall whitewash them in lime.

3. And you shall write upon the stones all the words  of this law, as when whenever you should pass over the Jordan, when ever you should enter into the land which the lord  your God gives to you; a land flowing milk and honey; in which manner [4spoke 1the lord  2God  3of your fathers] to you.

4. And it will be as when ever you should pass over the Jordan, you shall set  these stones, which I give charge to you today, on mount Ebal, and you shall whitewash them with lime.

5. And you shall build there an altar to the lord  your God -- an altar from out of stones; you shall not put upon them an iron tool.

6. [2stones 1Of whole] you shall build the altar to the lord  your God, and you shall offer upon it whole burnt-offerings to the lord  your God.

7. And you shall sacrifice a sacrifice of deliverance; and you shall eat there and shall be filled up, and be glad before the lord  your God.

8. And you shall write upon the stones all  this law -- [2clearly 1very].

9. And [7spoke 1Moses 2and 3the 4priests 5the 6Levites] to all Israel, saying, Keep silent and hear, O Israel! On  this day you have become a people to the lord  your God.

10. And you shall listen to the voice of the lord  your God, and you shall observe all  his commandments, and  his ordinances, which I give charge to you today.

11. And Moses gave charge to the people in  that day, saying,

12. These shall stand to bless the people in mount Gerizim passing over the Jordan; Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 

13.  Curses from Mount Ebal And these shall stand for the cursing on mount Ebal; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

May [2open 3to you 1the lord  6treasury 4his  5good], the heaven, to give the rain to your land in its season; to bless all the works  of your hands; and you shall lend [2nations 1to many], but you shall not borrow; and you shall yourself rule [2nations 1many], [4you 1but 2they shall not 3rule].

13. May [3place 4you 1the lord  2your God] as head, and not as the tail; and you will be then above, and you will not be underneath, if you should hearken to the commandments of the lord  your God, as many as I give charge to you today, to guard and to observe.

14. You shall not transgress from all the words which I give charge to you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods, to serve them.

21. May the lord cleave [3to 4you 1the 2plague] until whenever he should completely consume you from the land into which you enter there to inherit it.

22. [2strike 3you 1The lord] with perplexity, and burning heat, and shivering, and aggravation, and carnage, and wind-blown, and  paleness; and may they pursue you until whenever they should destroy you.

24. May the lord appoint the rain  of your land a cloud of dust; and dust from out of the heaven shall come down upon you, until it should obliterate you, and until whenever it should destroy you.

25. May [2appoint 3you 1the lord] for slaughter before  your enemies. In [2way 1one] you shall go forth against them, and in seven ways you shall flee from their face. And you will be in dispersion among all kingdoms of the earth.

26. And [2will be  1your dead] things devoured by the winged creatures of the heaven, and the wild beasts of the earth; and there will not be  one frightening away.

27. [2strike 3you 1The lord] with the sore of Egypt in the buttocks, and [2mange 1wild], and itching, so as to not be able to heal.

28. [2strike 3you 1The lord] in derangement, and inability to see, and an astonishment of thought.

29. And you will be groping at midday as [3one 4gropes 1the 2blind] in the darkness, and [2will not 3prosper  1your ways]. And you will be then injured and torn in pieces all the days, and there shall not be [2you  1one helping].

30. [2a wife 1You shall take], and [2man 1another] shall have her. [2a house 1You shall build], and you shall not live in it. [2a vineyard 1You shall plant], and in no way shall you gather its vintage.

34. And you will be deranged through the visions  of your eyes which you shall see.

35. [2strike 3you 1The lord] with [2sore 1a severe] upon the knees, and upon the legs, so as to not be able to heal yourself from the sole  of your feet unto the top of your head.

36. May the lord take you and  your rulers, whom ever you should place over yourself, by a nation who you have no knowledge of yourself nor  your fathers; and you shall serve there other gods of wood and stone.

37. And you will be there for an enigma, and a parable, and a tale, in all the nations into which ever [2should take 3you 1the lord] there.

38. [2seed 1Much] you shall bring forth in the plain, and little will be carried in, for [3shall eat 4them 1the 2locust].

40. Olive trees will be to you in all  your borders, but with olive oil you will not anoint, for [2shall flow away  1your olive].

45. And [3shall come 4upon 5you 1all  2these curses], and they shall pursue you, and overtake you, until whenever they shall utterly destroy you, and until whenever they shall consume you. For you did not listen to the voice of the lord  your God, to guard  his commandments, and  his ordinances, as many as I gave charge to you.

46. And they will be for signs to you, and miracles, and among  your seed until the eon.

47. Because you did not serve the lord  your God with gladness, and with a good heart, because of the multitude of all these.

48. And you shall serve  your enemies whom the lord shall send as a successor over you in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things. And he shall put a collar of iron upon  your neck, until whenever he should utterly destroy you.

49. [2shall bring 3upon 4you 1The lord] a nation far off from the end of the earth, as the impulse of an eagle, a nation of which you will not hear  its voice;

50. a nation impudent in its face who will not admire the face of an old man, and [3for the young 1will not 2show mercy].

51. And it will devour the progeny  of your cattle, and the produce  of your land, so as to not leave behind for you grain, wine, olive oil, herds  of your oxen, and the flocks  of your sheep, until whenever it should destroy you,

52. and should obliterate you in all  your cities, until whenever [2should be demolished  1your walls], the high and the fortified ones upon which you rely upon them in all  your land. And it shall afflict you in all  your cities, which [3gave 4to you 1the lord  2your God].

53. And you shall eat the progeny  of your belly, the meat of your sons and your daughters, as many as [3gave 4to you 1the lord  2your God] in  your straits, and in  your affliction, in which [2shall afflict 3you  1your enemy].

54. The one tender among you, and the [2delicate 1very] shall charm with his eye  his brother, and the wife  in  his bosom, and the left behind children, who ever should be left to him;

55. so as to give one of them from the flesh  of his children whom ever he should eat, because of the not having left behind to him anything in the straits, and in the affliction, in which ever [2should afflict 3you  1your enemies] in all  your cities.

56. And the tender among you, and the [2delicate one 1exceedingly] of whom has not [2an attempt 1taken]  with her foot to go upon the land because of the delicacy, and because of the tenderness -- she shall charm  with her eye  her husband, the one near her bosom, and  [2son 3and  4daughter 1her];

57. and  her afterbirth  coming forth through  her thighs, and  her child which ever she should give birth to -- they she shall eat them because of the lack of all things, secretly, in the straits. and in the affliction by which [2shall afflict 3you  1your enemy] in  your cities,

58. if you should not hearken to do all the discourses  of this law, the ones being written in  this scroll, to fear  [4name  3valued 2and  1this wonderful] -- the lord  your God.

59. Then the lord will render notorious  your calamities, and the calamities  of your seed, [4calamities 1great 2and 3surprising], and [4diseases 1severe 2and 3sure].

60. And he shall turn upon you all the grief of Egypt, the severe grief which you were on guard from in front of them, and they shall cleave to you.

61. And every infirmity, and every calamity  not being written, and every  one being written in  [2scroll 3of the 4law 1this], the lord shall bring upon you, until whenever he should utterly destroy you.

62. And you shall be left behind [2in 3number 1few] for you were as the stars of the heaven in multitude, for you did not hearken to the voice of the lord  your God.

63. And it will be in the manner the lord was glad over you, [2good 1to do] for you, and to multiply you; so the lord will be glad over you to utterly destroy you, and to lift you away from the land into which you enter there to inherit it.

64. And [3will disperse 4you 1the lord  2your God] into all the nations, from the tip of the earth, unto the other tip of the earth. And you shall slave there to other gods of wood and stone, which [2have no 3knowledge of 1you], nor  your fathers.

65. But also in  those nations he will not rest you, nor in any way will [4become 5stationary 1the 2sole  3of your foot]. And [2will give 3to you 1the lord] there [2heart 1another] being depressed, and failing eyes, and a melting soul.

66. And [2will be  1your life] hanging before  your eyes. And you shall have fear day and night, and not trust in your life.

67. In the morning you shall say, O how that it might become evening. And in the evening you shall say, O how that it might become morning; from the fear  of your heart of which you shall have fear, and from the visions  of your eyes which you shall see.

68. And [2will return 3you 1the lord] unto Egypt in boats, and in the way which I said, You shall not proceed again to behold it. And you shall be sold there to your enemies for manservants and maidservants, and none shall be  acquiring you.  

## Deuteronomy 29

1.  The LORD Preserves Israel These are the words of the covenant, which the lord gave charge to Moses to establish with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant of which he ordained with them in Horeb.

2. And Moses called all the sons of Israel, and he said to them, You see all as many things as [3did 1the lord  2your God] in the land of Egypt before you to Pharaoh and  his attendants, and all  his land;

3. the [2tests  1great] which [2have seen  1your eyes]; the signs and  [2miracles  1those great], by the [2hand  1strong], and the [2arm  1high].

4. And [3did not give 1the lord  2God] to you a heart to behold, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until  this day.

5. And he led you forty years in the wilderness. [2did not 3become old  1Your garments], and  your sandals did not wear away from  your feet.

6. [3bread 1You did not 2eat]; [3wine 4and 5liquor 1you did not 2drink], that you should know that I am the lord  your God.

7. And you came unto  this place. And came forth Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan to meet us in war.

8. And we struck them, and we took  their land, and we gave it by lot  to Reuben, and  to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. 

9.  Guard the Covenant And you shall guard all the words  of this covenant, to do them, that you should perceive all as much as you do.

10. You all stand today before the lord  your God;  your tribal chiefs, and  your council of elders, and  your judges, and  your judicial recorders, every man of Israel;

11.  your wives, and  your children, and the foreigner  in the midst  of your camp; from your woodcutter and unto your water-carrier,

12. to go in the covenant of the lord  your God, and in  his oaths, as many as the lord  your God ordains for you today.

13. That he should establish you to himself for a people, and he will be your God, in which manner he said to you, and in which manner he swore by an oath to your fathers -- Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.

14. And not to you alone I ordain  this covenant and  this oath,

15. but also to the ones here being with you today before the lord  your God, and to the ones not being with you here today.

16. For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, as we went by in the midst of the nations which you went by.

17. And you beheld  their abominations, and  their idols -- wood and stone, silver and gold, which is among them.

18. Lest there is among you, a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose  thought turned aside from the lord  your God, to go to serve to the gods  of those nations; lest there is among you a root [5upward 1germinating 2bile 3and 4bitterness].

19. And it shall be if you should hear the words  of this imprecation, and one should portend in  his heart, saying, [2sacred things 4to me 1May 3happen], for [2by 3the 4digression  5of my heart 1I shall go], that [3should not 4be destroyed together with 1the 2sinner] the sinless,

20. in no way should God want to propitiate for him, but then [3shall be burned away 1the anger 2of the lord], and  his zeal against  that man. Then shall cleave to him all the imprecations  of this covenant, the ones being written in  [2scroll 3of the 4law 1this]. And the lord will wipe away  his name from  under  heaven.

21. And [2shall separate him 1the lord] for evils from all the sons of Israel, according to all the imprecations of the covenant, the ones being written in  [2scroll 3of the 4law 1this].

22. And [3shall say  2generation  1another] -- even your sons who rise up after you, and the alien which ever should come from out of a land far off, that they shall see the calamities  of that land, and  its diseases, which the lord sent unto it,

23. sulphur and salt incinerating; all  its land shall not be sown, nor shall rise, nor should ascend upon it any green thing. As [4were eradicated 1Sodom 2and 3Gomorrah] -- Admah and Zeboim, which the lord eradicated in rage and anger,

24. and [4shall say 1all 2the 3nations], Why did [2do 1the lord] thus  to this land? What is  [2rage  3of anger  1this great]?

25. And they shall say, Because they left the covenant of the lord,  God  of their fathers, which he ordained with their fathers, when he led them out of the land of Egypt.

26. And going, they served other gods, and they did obeisance to them, ones which they had no knowledge of, nor knowledge spread to them.

27. And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] over  that land, to bring upon it according to all the imprecations  being written in  [2scroll 3of the 4law 1this].

28. And [2lifted 3them 1the lord] from  their land in rage and anger, and [3fit of temper 2great 1an exceedingly], and cast them into [2land 1another] as now.

29. The secret things belong to the lord  your God. But the open things are to you, and to your children into the eon, to do all the words  of this law.  

## Deuteronomy 30

1.  Reconciliation And it will be whenever [3should come 4upon 5you 1all  2these things], the blessing and the curse, which I put before your face, and you shall take them into  your heart in all the nations of which ever [3should disperse 4you 1the lord  2your God] there;

2. and you shall turn towards the lord  your God, and you shall hearken to  his voice, according to all as much as I give charge to you today, from [2entire  3heart 1your], and from [2entire  3soul 1your];

3. that the lord shall heal  your sins, and shall show mercy on you, and again shall bring you from out of all the nations into which [3dispersed 4you 1the lord  2your God] there.

4. Even if [2might be  1your dispersion] from one tip of the heaven unto one tip of the heaven, from there [3shall bring 4you 1the lord  2your God], and from there he will take you.

5. And [3will bring 4you 1the lord  2your God] into the land which [2inherited  1your fathers], and you shall inherit it, and [2you good 1he will do], and [2superabundant 3for you 1he will do] above  your fathers.

6. And the lord shall purge  your heart, and the heart  of your seed, to love the lord  your God from [2entire  3heart 1your], and from [2entire  3soul 1your], that you should live.

7. And [3shall put 1the lord  2your God]  these curses upon  your enemies, and upon the ones detesting you, who pursued you.

8. And you shall turn and shall listen to the voice of the lord  your God, and shall observe  his commandments, as many as I give charge to you today.

9. And [3shall take great care 4of you 1the lord  2your God] in every work  of your hands, in the progeny  of your belly, and in the progeny  of your cattle, and in the produce  of your land, because [3shall turn 1the lord  2your God] to be glad over you for good things, as he was glad over  your fathers.

10. If you should hearken to the voice of the lord  your God, to guard  his commandments, and  his ordinances -- the ones written in the scroll  of this law, if you turn to the lord  your God with [2entire  3heart 1your], and with [2entire  3soul 1your].

11. For  this commandment which I give charge to you today [2not 3enormous 1is], nor [2far 3from 4you 1is it].

12. [2not 3in 4the 5heaven 1It is], saying, Who shall ascend of us into the heaven, and shall take it to us, and hearing it we will do it?

13. Nor [2on the other side 3of the 4sea 1is it], saying, Who will pass through for us to the other side of the sea, and shall take it for us, and hearing it we will do it?

14. [5near 6you 3is 1But the 2word 4very], in  your mouth, and in  your heart, and in  your hands to do it.

15. Behold, I put before your face today  life and  death,  good and  bad.

16. But if you should hearken to the commandments of the lord  your God, which I give charge to you today, to love the lord  your God, to go in all  his ways, and to guard  his ordinances, and  his commandments, and  his judgments, then you shall live, and you will be populous, and [3will bless 4you 1the lord  2your God] in all the land into which you enter there to inherit it.

17. And if [2should change over  1your heart], and you should not listen, and in wandering you should do obeisance to other gods, and should serve them;

18. I announce to you today, that by destruction you will be destroyed, and in no way [2many days 1shall there be] upon the land, into which you pass over the Jordan there to inherit it.

19. I call to testify to you today both the heaven and the earth. The life and  death I put before your face; the blessing and the curse; then choose the life, that you should live and  your seed;

20. to love the lord  your God, to listen to  his voice, and to hold what is of his. For this is  your life, and the duration  of your days, to dwell upon the land of which the lord swore by an oath to your fathers -- Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, to give it to them.  

## Deuteronomy 31

1.  Moses Gives Exhortation And Moses completed speaking all  these words to all the sons of Israel.

2. And he said to them, A hundred and twenty years I am today. I shall not be able still to enter and go forth. For the lord said to me, You shall not pass over  this Jordan.

3. The lord  your God, the one going forth before your face, he shall utterly destroy  these nations from your face, and you shall inherit them; and Joshua is the one going forth before your face, as spoke the lord.

4. And the lord shall do to them as he did to Sihon and Og, to the two kings of the Amorites, the ones who were on the other side of the Jordan, and to their land, in so far as he utterly destroyed them.

5. And [2delivered 3them up 1the lord] before you; and you shall do to them in so far as I gave charge to you.

6. Be manly and be strong! Do not fear! nor should you be timid, nor should you be terrified from their face. For the lord  your God, the one going before with you -- in no way should he forsake you, nor in any way should he abandon you.

7. And Moses called Joshua, and said to him before all Israel, Be manly and strong! For you shall enter before the face  of this people, into the land which the lord swore by an oath to your fathers to give to them, and you shall allot it to them.

8. And the lord, the one going with you will not send you away, nor in any way abandon you. Do not fear nor be timid!

9. And Moses wrote the sayings  of this law in a scroll, and he gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, the ones lifting the ark of the covenant of the lord, and to the elders of the sons of Israel.

10. And Moses gave charge to them in  that day, saying, After seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the holiday of pitching of tents,

11. in the going with all Israel to appear before the lord  your God, in the place in which ever the lord should choose, you shall read  this law before all Israel in  their ears.

12. Assemble the people! the men, and the women, and the progeny, and the foreigner, the one in  your cities, that they should hear, and that they should learn to fear the lord  your God. And they shall hearken to do all the words  of this law.

13. And  their sons, the ones who have not known, they shall hear, and shall learn to fear the lord  your God all the days, as many as they live upon the land, into which you pass over the Jordan there to inherit it.

14. And the lord said to Moses, Behold, [4are approaching 1the 2days  3of your death]; call Joshua, and stand by the door of the tent of the testimony! and I will give charge to him. And [4went 1Moses 2and 3Joshua] into the tent of the testimony, and they stood by the door of the tent of the testimony. 

15.  The Column of Cloud Appears And the lord came down in a column of cloud. And it stood at the door of the tent of the testimony. And [4stood 1the 2column  3of cloud] by the door of the tent.

16. And the lord said to Moses, Behold, you go to sleep with  your fathers. And rising up, this  people shall fornicate after alien gods of the land into which this people enter there into it. And they shall forsake me, and shall efface  my covenant which I ordained with them.

17. And I shall be provoked to anger in rage with them in  that day, and I will leave them, and I will turn  my face from them, and they shall be a thing devoured. And [5shall find 6him 2evils 1many 3and 4afflictions]; and he shall say in  that day, because [3is not 1the lord  2my God] among me [2found 3me  1these evils].

18. And I in turning will turn away  my face from them in  that day because of all the evils which they did, for they turned away unto alien gods.

19. And now write the words  of this ode, and teach it to the sons of Israel! And you shall put it into  their mouth, that [3should be 4to me  2ode 1this] a testimony among the sons of Israel.

20. For I shall bring them into the [2land  1good] which I swore by an oath to their fathers; a land flowing milk and honey. And they shall eat. And being filled up they shall satisfy themselves, and shall turn to alien gods, and shall serve to them, and shall provoke me, and shall efface  my covenant which I ordained with them.

21. And it will be whenever [5shall find 6him 2evils 1many 3and 4afflictions], and [3shall stand firm  2ode 1this 5against 6their face 4witnessing]. For they should not forget it from their mouth, and from the mouth  of their seed. For I perceive  their wickedness, as much as they do here today, before  my bringing them into the [2land  1good] which I swore by an oath to their fathers.

22. And Moses wrote  this ode in that  day, and he taught it to the sons of Israel.

23. And Moses gave charge to Joshua son of Nun and said, Be manly and be strong! For you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land which [2swore by an oath 3to them 1the lord], and he will be with you.

24. And when Moses completed writing all the words  of this law in a scroll, until completion,

25. that he gave charge to the Levites, to the ones lifting the ark of the covenant of the lord, saying,

26. Taking the scroll  of this law, you shall put it sideways in the ark of the covenant of the lord  your God; and it will be there to you for a testimony.

27. For I know the aggravation caused by you, and  [3neck 1your  2hard]. For still in my living with you today, [2embittering greatly 1you have been] the things towards  God; how not so also at the last  at my death?

28. Hold an assembly for me  of your tribal chiefs, and  your elders, and  your judicial recorders! that I should speak into  their ears all  these words; and I call to testify to them both the heaven and the earth.

29. For I know that at the last  of my decease, with lawlessness you shall act lawlessly, and shall turn aside from the way of which I gave charge to you; and [2shall meet with 3you  1evils] at the last of the days; for you shall do the evil before the lord to provoke him to anger by the works  of your hands.

30. And Moses spoke into the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words  of this ode, until completion.  

## Deuteronomy 32

1.  The Ode of Moses Take heed, O heaven! and I will speak. And hear,  O earth, the discourses from out of my mouth!

2. Expect as the rain  my maxims, and let [2go down 3as 4dew  1my discourses], as a heavy shower upon wild grass, and as snowflakes upon grass!

3. For [2the 3name 4of the lord 1I called]. Give greatness to our God!

4. God, [2are true  1his works], and all  his ways are equity. God is trustworthy, and there is no injustice in him; just and sacred is the lord.

5. They sinned -- they are not his children; they are a scoffing -- [2generation 1a crooked], and one turning aside.

6. [2these things 3to the lord 1Do you recompense] thus, O people, moronish and not wise? Did not he, this your father, acquire you, and make you, and shape you?

7. Remember the days of the eon! Perceive indeed the years of the generations of generations! Ask  your father, and he will announce to you;  your elders, and they shall speak to you.

8. When [3divided 5into parts 1the 2highest 4nations], as he disseminated the sons of Adam, he set the borders of nations according to the number of the angels of God;

9. and [3became 4a portion 5for the lord 1his people 2Jacob]. [2is a piece of measured out land 3of his inheritance 1Israel].

10. He sufficed him in  [2land 1a wilderness], in thirst of sweltering heat in [2land 1a waterless]. He encircled him, and corrected him, and guarded him as a pupil of an eye.

11. As an eagle sheltering his nest, [2and 3over  4his young 1he longs after]. Thrusting out  his wings he receives them; and he takes them upon  his upper back.

12. The lord alone led them, and there was not with them an alien god.

13. He brought them unto the strength of the land. He fed them produce of fields. They nursed honey out of the rock, and olive oil out of the solid rock.

14. Butter of oxen, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs and rams, offspring of bulls and he-goats, with fat of kidneys of wheat, and [3the blood 4of the grape 1they drank 2wine].

15. And Jacob ate and was filled up, and [3kicked up 1the 2one being loved]; he was fattened, he was thickened, he was widened, and he abandoned God the one making him; and he left from God his deliverer.

16. They provoked me over the alien ones; in their abominations they greatly embittered me.

17. They sacrificed to demons, and not to God -- to gods in whom they did not know; new and newly made gods have come, in whom [2knew not  1their fathers].

18. God, the one creating you, you abandoned; and you forgot God the one maintaining you.

19. And the lord beheld, and was jealous; and he was provoked to anger by their sons and daughters.

20. And he said, I will turn away  my face from them, and I will show what will be to them at the last times, for [2a generation 3being distorted 1it is]; sons in whom there is no belief in them.

21. They provoked me to jealousy over that which is not god; they provoked me to anger with  their idols. And I shall provoke them to jealousy over that which is not a nation. Over [2nation 1a senseless] I will provoke them to anger.

22. For a fire burns away of  my rage; it shall be burned unto [2Hades 1lower]; it shall devour the land, and  its produce; it shall blaze on the foundations of mountains.

23. I bring together to them bad things; and by my arrows I will finish with them;

24. melting them away in hunger, and being food of fowls, and [2convulsion 1incurable]. The teeth of wild beasts I will send as a successor to them, with rage dragging them upon the ground.

25. From outside [2shall make them childless 1the sword], and from out of the inner chambers fear; the young man with the virgin, the one nursing being placed with the old man.

26. I said, I will disperse them, and I will cause [2to cease 3from among 4men  1their memorial].

27. Unless they should say it was on account of the anger of the enemies, that in no way should they live a long time, and that in no way [2join in making an attack  1their opponents], lest they should say,  [3hand 1Our  2high], and not the lord did all these things.

28. For [2a nation 3destroying 4counsel 1it is], and there is no [2in 3them 1higher knowledge].

29. They did not think to perceive; let them appreciate in the coming time.

30. How shall [2pursue 1one] thousands, and two rout ten thousands, unless  God rendered them up, and the lord delivered them up?

31. For [2are not 3as  4our God  1their gods],  but our enemies are unthinking.

32. For of the grapevine of Sodom is their grapevine, and  their small vine branch is of Gomorrah;  their grape is the grape of bile, their cluster is bitterness to them.

33. The rage of serpents is their wine, and [2rage 3of asps 1the incurable].

34. Behold, are not these things brought together by me, and a set seal among  my treasures?

35. In the day of punishment I shall recompense, in a time whenever [2should trip  1their foot]; for [3is near 1the day 2of their destruction], and at hand prepared for you.

36. For the lord judges  his people, and over  his menservants he shall be comforted. For he beheld their being disabled, and failing in the hostile invasion, and were weakened.

37. And the lord said, Where are  their gods upon whom they yielded upon them?

38. Of whom the fat  of their sacrifices you ate, and drank the wine  of their libations? Let them rise up and help you, and be your shelterer!

39. Behold! behold that I am! and there is no God besides me. I shall kill, and [2to live 1I shall make]. I shall strike, and I will heal. And there is not one who shall rescue from out of  my hands.

40. For I shall lift into the heaven  my hand, and I shall swear by an oath  by my right hand. And I will say, I live into the eon.

41. For I will sharpen [2as 3lightning  1my sword], and [2will hold to 3equity  1my hand]. And I will recompense punishment against the enemies; and against the ones detesting me I will recompense.

42. I shall intoxicate  my arrows of blood, and  my sword shall devour meats from the blood of the slain, and from the captivity of the heads of the rulers of the enemies.

43. Be glad, O heavens, together with him! and do obeisance to him, all angels of God! Be glad, O nations, with  his people! And grow in strength in him all, O sons of God! For the blood  of his sons he shall avenge, and he shall avenge and recompense punishment to the enemies. And to the ones detesting him he will recompense, and the lord shall clear out the land  for his people.

44. And Moses wrote  this ode in  that day. And he taught it to the sons of Israel. And Moses approached and spoke all the words  of this law into the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.

45. And Moses completed speaking  these words to all Israel.

46. And he said to them, You take heed in your heart over all  these words which I testify to you today, which you shall charge to your sons, to guard and to do all the words  of this law!

47. For [2is not 4word 3an empty 1this] for you, for this is  your life. And because of  this word you shall prolong your days upon the land into which you pass over the Jordan there to inherit it.

48. And the lord spoke to Moses in  this day, saying,

49. Ascend into the mountain  Abarim, this mountain Nebo! which is in the land of Moab, against the face of Jericho. And behold the land of Canaan! which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession.

50. And come to an end in the mountain into which you ascend there! And be added to  your people! in which manner [3died 1Aaron  2your brother] in Hor the mountain, and was added to  his people.

51. Because you resisted persuasion  of my word, among the sons of Israel at the water of dispute, Kadesh, in the wilderness of Sin; because you did not sanctify me among the sons of Israel.

52. For [4before you 1you shall see 2the 3land], and [2there 1you shall not enter], into the land which I give to the sons of Israel.  

## Deuteronomy 33

1.  Moses Blesses Israel Before His Decease This is the blessing which [4blessed 1Moses 2the man  3of God] the sons of Israel before  his decease.

2. And he said, The lord [2from out of 3Sinai 1is come], and he appeared upon Seir to us. And he hastened from out of mount Paran with myriads of Kadesh -- at his right were angels with him.

3. And he spared  his people, and all the ones being sanctified by  your hands; these [2under 3you 1are]; and he received of  his words

4. the law which [2gave charge 3to us 1Moses], an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.

5. And he will be [2with 3the 4one being loved 1a ruler] being brought [2with rulers 3of peoples 1together] among tribes of Israel.

6. Let Reuben live and not die! And let Simon be many in number!

7. And this for Judah, Listen, O lord, of the voice of Judah, and unto  his people! may they enter in.  His hands shall litigate for him; and [2a helper 3from  4his enemies 1you will be].

8. And  to Levi he said, Give to Levi his manifestations and his truth to the [2man  1sacred], whom they tested him in Trial; they reviled him at Water of Dispute;

9. the one saying to his father and to his mother, I have not seen you; and  his brethren he did not recognize, and  his sons he did not know. He guarded  your oracles, and  [2your covenant 1he observed].

10. They shall manifest  your ordinances  to Jacob, and  your law  to Israel. They shall place incense in the time of your anger always upon  your altar.

11. Bless, O lord  his strength! And the works  of his hands receive! Break the loin [2having risen up against him 1of his enemies]! And the ones detesting him let them not rise up!

12. And  to Benjamin he said, One being loved by the lord; he shall encamp being yielded, and  God shadows over him all the days, and [2between  3his shoulders 1he rested].

13. And  to Joseph he said, [2is of 3the blessing 4of the lord  1His hand], of seasons of heaven, and of dew, and of the deeps of springs below,

14. and according to the season of the offsprings [2of the sun 1of the circuits], and of the returns of the months;

15. from the top [2mountains 1of ancient], and from the top [2hills 1of everlasting],

16. and according to [3in season 2of the land 1the fullness], and the accepted things  being seen in the bush -- may they come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top being glorified among brethren.

17. As a first-born bull  is his beauty. Horns of a unicorn  are his horns. With them [2nations 1he shall gore] together, even from the tip of the earth. These are the myriads of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh.

18. And  to Zebulun he said, Be glad, O Zebulun, in your departure, and Issachar in  your tents!

19. [2nations 1They shall utterly destroy], and you shall call upon there, and you shall sacrifice a sacrifice of righteousness; for the riches of the sea shall nurse you, and market-places [2on the coast 1dwelling].

20. And  to Gad he said, One being blessed, widening Gad. As a lion he rested, having broken the arm, and the ruler.

21. And he beheld his first-fruit, for there [2was portioned 1the land] by rulers being brought together, heads of peoples; [3righteousness 1the lord 2did], and his equity was with Israel.

22. And  to Dan he said, Dan, [2cub 1a lion], and he shall rush out from  Bashan.

23. And  to Naphtali he said, Naphtali a fullness of acceptable things; and let him be filled with blessing from the lord! [2the west 3and 4the south 1You shall inherit].

24. And  to Asher he said, [2is one being blessed 3of 4children 1Asher]; and he will be acceptable to his brethren; he shall dip [2in 3olive oil  1his foot];

25. iron and brass  [2his sandal 1will be]; and as  your days  so your strength.

26. There is not any as the God of the one being loved. The one mounting upon the heaven is your helper, even the majestic one of the firmament.

27. And [3shall shelter 4you 2of God 1the sovereignty], and that under the strength [2arms 1of everlasting]. And he shall cast out from your face the enemy, saying, May you perish.

28. And Israel shall encamp alone complying; fountain of Jacob, with grain and wine; and the heaven [3on him 1covered with clouds 2in dew].

29. Blessed are you, O Israel. Who is likened to you, a people being delivered by the lord? [2is the shield  1Your helper], and the sword of your boasting. And [2shall lie 3to you  1your enemies], and you [2upon  3their neck 1shall mount].  

## Deuteronomy 34

1.  Moses Views the Land of the Oath And Moses ascended from the wilderness of Moab unto  mount Nebo, upon the top of Pisgah, which is upon the face of Jericho. And [2showed 3to him 1the lord] all the land of Gilead unto Dan,

2. and all the land of Naphtali, and all the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah unto the [2sea  1latter];

3. and the wilderness, and the places round about Jericho, City of Palms unto Zoar.

4. And the lord said to Moses, This is the land which I swore by an oath  to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your seed I shall give it. And I showed it to your eyes, but there you shall not enter. 

5.  Death of Moses And [2came to an end 3there 1Moses], the servant of the lord, in the land of Moab by the word of the lord.

6. And they entombed him in the land of Moab near the house of Peor. And not has [2known 1any one]  his burial place until  this day.

7. And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old at  his coming to an end. [2were not 3darkened  1His eyes], nor were [2corrupted  1his lips].

8. And [4wept over 1the 2sons 3of Israel] Moses in the wilderness of Moab, at the Jordan by Jericho for thirty days; and they completed the days of the mourning of weeping for Moses.

9. And Joshua son of Nun was filled of spirit of understanding; [3placed 1for 2Moses]  his hands upon him. And [4hearkened to 5him 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and they did in so far as the lord gave charge to Moses.

10. And rose up not any longer a prophet in Israel as Moses, whom the lord knew him face to face,

11. in all the signs and miracles, which [2sent 3him 1the lord] to do them in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to his attendants, and to all  his land;

12. and the [2wonders  1great], and all by the [2hand  1fortified] which Moses executed before all Israel.
