## 1 Peter 1

1.  Regeneration Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen immigrants of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

2. according to the foreknowledge of God the father, in sanctification of spirit, in obedience and sprinkling of blood of Jesus Christ. Favor to you and peace be multiplied.

3. Blessed is the God and father  of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one according to  his great mercy regenerated us unto [2hope 1a living] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

4. unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, being kept in the heavens for us,

5. the ones by power of God being guarded through belief, for deliverance prepared to be uncovered in [2time 1the last].

6. In which you exult a little just now, if it is necessary, being fretted by various tests,

7. that the proving [3of yours 1of the 2belief] (much more esteemed than gold that perishes) [3through 4fire 1even 2being tried], should be found in high praise, and glory, and honor, in revelation of Jesus Christ.

8. Whom not having seen, you love; in whom now not looking on, but believing, you exult with joy unspeakable, and glorifying;

9. carrying on the end of the belief of yours -- deliverance of your souls.

10. Concerning which deliverance [2sought 3and 4searched out 1the prophets], the ones [2concerning 3the 5towards 6you 4favor 1prophesying];

11. searching in what, or of what kind of time [3was manifest  4in 5them 1spirit 2of Christ], testifying beforehand the [2in 3Christ 1sufferings], and the [2after 3these things 1glories];

12. to whom it was revealed that, it was not to themselves, but to us they were serving up those things, which now were announced to you by the ones announcing good news to you in [2spirit 1holy] sent from heaven, in which [2desire 1angels] to lean over to see. 

13.  Instructions for Holy Living Therefore having girded the loins  of your mind, being sober, perfectly hope upon the [2being brought 3to you 1favor] in the revelation of Jesus Christ!

14. being as children of obedience, not conforming to the former things in the ignorance of your desires.

15. But as the one calling you is holy, even you yourselves [2holy 3in 4all 5your behavior 1become]!

16. Because it has been written, [2holy 1Become], for I am holy!

17. And if [2the father 1you call upon], the one impartially judging according to the [2of each 1work], [6in 7fear 2the  3sojourn 4of your 5time 1behave]!

18. knowing that not by corruptible silver or gold were you ransomed from out of  your vain behavior handed down from your fathers;

19. but by the esteemed blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, of Christ;

20. having been foreknown indeed before the founding of the world, but being manifested at the last of the times for us,

21. the ones through him believing in God, the one raising him from the dead, and [2glory 3to him 1having given], so as for the belief of yours and hope to be in God.

22.  Your souls being purified in the obedience of the truth through spirit, in [2brotherly affection 1unpretentious], from out of a pure heart [2one another 1love] fervently!

23. Being regenerated, not from out of [2sowing 1a corruptible], but of incorruptible, by the word of God living and abiding in the eon.

24. For all flesh is as grass, and all glory of man is as the flower of grass. [3withered 1The 2grass], and  its flower fell away.

25. But the word of the Lord abides into the eon. And this is the word -- the good news being announced to you.  

## 1 Peter 2

1.  Living Stones and the Cornerstone Having put aside then all evil, and all treachery, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,

2. as newborn babes, [2the 3rational 4sincere 5milk 1long after]! that by it you should grow;

3. if indeed you tasted that [3is gracious 1the 2Lord].

4. To whom coming forward [2stone 1as a living], [3by 4men 1indeed 2being rejected], but by God chosen, valued;

5. also yourselves, as [2stones 1living], are being built up [2house 1a spiritual], [2priesthood 1a holy], to offer spiritual sacrifices, well-received  to God through Jesus Christ.

6. For it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I place in Zion [4stone 3cornering 1a chosen 2valued]; and the one believing upon him, in no way shall be disgraced.

7. To you then a stone of value -- to the ones believing; but to the ones disobeying, a stone which [3rejected 1the ones 2building], this one became for the head of the corner,

8. and a stone of stumbling, and a rock causing offence, which they stumble against the word, being disobedient; to which also they were appointed. 

9.  A Chosen Race But you [2race 1are a chosen], a royal priesthood, [2nation 1a holy], a people for procurement; so that [2the 3virtues 1you should publish] of the one [2from out of 3darkness 1calling you] into  his wonderful light.

10. The ones at some time or other not a people, but now are a people of God; the ones not being shown mercy, but now are shown mercy.

11. Beloved, I appeal to you as sojourners and immigrants, to be at a distance from the fleshy desires, which soldier against the soul;

12.  [2behavior 1having your] good among the nations; that in what they speak ill of you, as ones doing evil, that from [2the 3good 4works 1having scrutinized], they should glorify  God in the day of visitation. 

13.  Concerning Submission to Institutions Submit then to every human institution for the sake of the Lord! whether to king as being superior;

14. or whether to governors as [2by 3him 1being sent] for punishment indeed on ones doing evil, and high praise on ones beneficial.

15. For so is the will  of God, by doing good to halt the  [2of foolish 3men 1ignorance];

16. as free, and not [3as 4a covering 1having  5of evil  2freedom], but as bondmen of God.

17. Honor all! [2the 3brotherhood 1Love]!  Fear God! [2the 3king 1Honor]!

18.  Domestic servants -- being submitted with all fear to the masters, not only to the good and lenient, but also to the crooked.

19. For this is favor, if through conscience of God anyone endures distress, suffering unjustly.

20. For what fame if sinning and [2being buffeted 1you endure]? But if doing good and suffering you endure, this is favorable with God.

21. For this you were called, for also Christ suffered for us, leaving behind to us a pattern, that you should follow after  his tracks;

22. who [3sin 2not 1did], nor was there [2found 1treachery] in  his mouth;

23. who being reviled did not return verbal abuse; when suffering did not threaten; but delivered himself up to the one judging justly;

24. who  [3our sins 1himself 2bore] in  his body upon the timber, that  [2to sins 1becoming dead], [2to the 3righteousness 1we should live]; of which by his stripe you were healed.

25. For you were as sheep wandering; but are returned now unto the shepherd and overseer  of your souls.  

## 1 Peter 3

1.  Concerning Submission in Marriage In like manner the wives, being submitted to their own husbands; that even if any resist persuasion to the word, by the [2of the 3wives 1behavior 5without 6a word 4they shall be gained],

2. having scrutinized  [4in 5fear 2pure 3behavior 1your].

3. Whom let there not be the outward braiding of hair, and adornment of gold or clothing of garments of ornamentation!

4. But let it be the hidden [2of the 3heart 1mankind], in the incorruptible ornament of the gentle and unassuming spirit, which is [2in the presence of  3of God 1lavish].

5. For thus at some time or other also the holy women, the ones hoping upon  God, adorned themselves, being submitted to their own husbands;

6. as Sarah obeyed to Abraham, [3lord 2him 1calling]; of whom you became children, doing good and not fearing with any terror.

7. The husbands, in like manner, living with them according to knowledge, as being a weaker utensil in the feminine way, bestowing honor as also joint-heirs of favor of life, so as to not hinder  your prayers.

8. But the conclusion -- all be agreeing, sympathizing, having brotherly affection, compassionate, obliging,

9. not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but on the other hand, blessing, knowing that in this you were called, that [2a blessing 1you should inherit].

10. For the one wanting [2life 1to love], and to behold [2days 1good], let him cease  his tongue from evil, and his lips  to not speak deceit!

11. Let him turn aside from evil, and let him do good! Let him seek peace, and pursue it!

12. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears towards their supplication. But the face of the Lord is against the ones doing evil. 

13.  Concerning Affliction And who is the one afflicting you, if [3of the 4good 2mimics 1you should become]?

14. But if also you may suffer because of righteousness, blessed are you; but the fear of them you should not fear, nor should you be disturbed.

15. [3the Lord 1But  4God 2sanctify] in  your hearts, and be ready continually for a defense to all, to the one asking you a word concerning the [2in 3you 1hope], with gentleness and fear;

16. [3conscience 1having 2a good], that in what they should speak ill of you as ones doing evil, [8should be put to shame 1the ones 2threatening 3your  4good 6in 7Christ 5behavior].

17. For it is better [7for doing good 1if 5wants you 2the 3will  4of God 6to suffer], than doing evil.

18. For Christ also [2once 3for 4sins 1suffered], the just for the unjust, that he should lead us forward to God, having put to death indeed the flesh, but being restored to life to the spirit;

19. in which also [3to the 5in 6prison 4spirits 1having gone 2he proclaimed],

20. to the ones who disobeyed at some time or other, when once [4was accepted 1the  3of God 2long-suffering] in the days of Noah, carefully preparing the ark, in which few, that is to say, eight souls were preserved through water.

21. Which [2also 5us 1antitype 3now 4delivers] -- immersion, not the flesh getting rid of filth, but [3conscience 2of a good 1the response] towards God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

22. who is at the right  of God, being gone into heaven, [6being submitted 7to him 1with angels 2and 3authorities 4and 5powers].  

## 1 Peter 4

1.  Instructions for Sound Living Christ then having suffered for us in flesh, you also with the same reflection be armed! For the one suffering in flesh, has ceased of sin;

2. to no longer [6of men's 7desires 8but 9God's will 2the remaining 4in 5the flesh 1spend 3time].

3. For sufficient to us was the having passed time of the existence [2the 3will 4of the 5nations 1to have worked], going in lewdnesses, desires, drunkennesses with wine, debaucheries, drinking banquets, and unlawful idolatries;

4. in which they think it strange [2not 3running together 1your] in the same  [2of carnality 1pouring out], being blasphemous;

5. ones who shall render an account to the one readily sufficing to judge the living and dead.

6. [2in 3this 1For] also to the dead was announced good news, that they should be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but should live according to God in spirit.

7. But of all things the end approaches. Be of sound mind then and be sober in the prayers!

8. [2before 3all things 1But 5the 8among 9yourselves 7love 6intense 4having]; for the love covers a multitude of sins;

9. being hospitable to one another without grumblings;

10. each as he received favor, to each other serving, as good managers of the variegated favor of God.

11. If any speaks, let it be as oracles of God; if any serves, let it be as from out of strength which God supplies; that in all things God should be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might into the eons of the eons. Amen.

12. Beloved, do not take it as strange the [3among 4you 1burning fire 5to 6test 7you 2taking place], as a strange thing happening to you;

13. but according to that which you participate with the [2of the 3Christ 1sufferings] rejoice! that also in the revelation  of his glory you should rejoice exulting.

14. If you are berated in the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the  glory and the  spirit of God [2unto 3you 1gives rest]. Indeed according to them he is blasphemed, but according to you he is glorified.

15. For let not any of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or one doing evil, or as a busybody!

16. But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify  God in  this part!

17. For it is the time  to begin the judgment from the house  of God; and if first from us, what is the end of the ones disobeying the  good news of God?

18. And if the righteous one hardly is delivered, the impious and sinner, where shall they appear?

19. So then, even the ones suffering according to the will  of God, as to a trustworthy creator, let them place  their souls in doing good.  

## 1 Peter 5

1.  Exhortations to Elders Elders, the ones among you, I exhort, I the fellow-elder and witness of the [2of the 3Christ 1sufferings], the one also [2of the 3about to be 4revealed 5glory 1partner] --

2. tend the [3among 4you 1flock  2of God]! overseeing, not by compelling, but voluntarily; nor sordidly, but eagerly;

3. nor as one dominating the lots, but [2models 1becoming] for the flock.

4. And at the manifesting of the chief shepherd, you shall carry the unfading  [2of glory 1crown].

5. In like manner let the younger ones submit to the older ones! And all [4one to another 3being submitted  2humility 1adorn]! For  God [2the proud 1resists], [4to the humble 1but 2gives 3favor].

6. Be humbled then under the fortified hand  of God! that he should exalt you in time;

7. [2all  3your anxiety 1while casting] upon him, for with him there is a care concerning you.

8. Be sober! Be vigilant!  Your opponent the devil [2as 4lion 3a roaring 1walks] seeking whom he should swallow down.

9. To whom oppose solid in the belief! knowing the same  sufferings to the one in the world [2by your 3brotherhood 1are being completed].

10. But the God of all favor, the one having called us into  his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, [2a little 1having suffered], may he ready you, support you, strengthen you, found you.

11. To him be the glory and the might into the eons of the eons. Amen.

12. Through Silvanus, [4to you 1the 2trustworthy 3brother], as I consider, a little I wrote, appealing and attesting this to be the true favor  of God in which you stand.

13. [5greets 6you 1She 3in 4Babylon 2chosen with you], and Mark  my son.

14. Greet one another with a kiss of love! Peace to you, to all the ones in Christ Jesus. Amen.
