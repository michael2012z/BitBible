## Matthew 1

1.  The Genealogy of Jesus Christ The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.

2. Abraham engendered  Isaac, and Isaac engendered  Jacob, and Jacob engendered  Judah and  his brothers,

3. and Judah engendered  Perez and  Zara from  Tamar, and Perez engendered  Esrom, and Esrom engendered  Aram,

4. and Aram engendered  Aminadab, and Aminadab engendered  Naasson, and Naasson engendered  Salmon,

5. and Salmon engendered  Boaz from  Rahab, and Boaz engendered  Obed from  Ruth, and Obed engendered  Jesse,

6. and Jesse engendered  David the king, and David the king engendered  Solomon from the wife  of Uriah.

7. And Solomon engendered  Rehoboam, and Rehoboam engendered  Abia, and Abia engendered  Asa,

8. and Asa engendered  Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat engendered  Joram, and Joram engendered  Uzziah,

9. and Uzziah engendered  Jotham, and Jotham engendered  Ahaz, and Ahaz engendered  Hezekiah,

10. and Hezekiah engendered  Manasseh, and Manasseh engendered  Amon, and Amon engendered  Josiah,

11. and Josiah engendered  Jechoniah and  his brethren unto the displacement in Babylon.

12. And after the displacement of Babylon, Jechoniah engendered  Salathiel, and Salathiel engendered  Zerubbabel,

13. and Zerubbabel engendered  Abiud, and Abiud engendered  Eliakim, and Eliakim engendered  Azor,

14. and Azor engendered  Zadok, and Zadok engendered  Achim, and Achim engendered  Eliud,

15. and Eliud engendered  Eleazar, and Eleazar engendered  Matthan, and Matthan engendered  Jacob,

16. and Jacob engendered  Joseph the husband of Mary from out of whom was born Jesus, being called Christ.

17. All then the generations from Abraham unto David -- [2generations 1fourteen]; and from David unto the displacement of Babylon -- [2generations 1fourteen]; and from the displacement of Babylon unto the Christ -- [2generations 1fourteen]. 

18.  The Nativity of Jesus Christ And the [2of Jesus 3Christ  1nativity] was thus. [4being espoused 1For  2his mother 3Mary] to Joseph, before  their coming together, was found [2in 3the womb 1having one] of [2spirit 1holy].

19. And Joseph  her husband, being righteous, and not wanting to make her an example, willed in private to dismiss her.

20. [4these things 1And 2of his 3pondering], behold, an angel of the Lord by dream appeared to him, saying, Joseph son of David, you should not fear to take to yourself Mary  your wife; for the one in her [2engendered 3of 5spirit 1is 4holy].

21. And she shall bear a son, and you shall call  his name Jesus, for he shall deliver  his people from  their sins.

22. And this completely happened that should be fulfilled the thing having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

23. Behold, the virgin [2in 3the womb 1has one], and she shall birth a son, and they shall call  his name Emmanuel; which is being translated, [2with 3us  1God].

24. [3having been awakened 1And  2Joseph] from the sleep did as [4assigned 5to him 1the 2angel 3of the Lord], and he took to himself  his wife.

25. And [3not 1he knew 2her] until of which time she bore  [3son 1her  2first-born]. And he called  his name Jesus.  

## Matthew 2

1.  The Visit of the Magi  And Jesus having been born in Bethlehem  of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east came unto Jerusalem,

2. saying, Where is the one having been born king of the Jews? For we beheld his  star in the east, and we came to do obeisance to him.

3. And hearing, Herod the king was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.

4. And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ is born.

5. And they said to him, In Bethlehem  of Judea; for thus it has been written by the prophet,

6. And you, Bethlehem, land of Judea, [2not at all 3least 1are] in the governs of Judea. [2from out of 3you 1For] shall come forth one leading, who shall tend  my people  Israel.

7. Then Herod, in private having called the magi, exacted from them the time of the [2appearing 1star].

8. And having sent them unto Bethlehem, he said, Having gone, exactly inquire concerning the child! And when you should have found, report to me, so that I also having come should do obeisance to him.

9. And they, having heard the king, went. And behold, the star which they beheld in the east led before them, until having come it stood above of which place [3was 1the 2child].

10. And beholding the star, they rejoiced [2joy 1a great], exceedingly.

11. And having come unto the residence, they saw the child with Mary  his mother. And having fallen, they did obeisance to him. And having opened  their treasuries, they offered to him gifts -- gold and frankincense and myrrh.

12. And having received a divine message by dream, to not return to Herod, [2by 3another 4way 1they withdrew] unto  their place.

13. [3withdrawing 1And 2of their], behold, an angel of the Lord appeared by dream to Joseph, saying, Having arisen, take to yourself the child and  his mother, and flee into Egypt! and be there until whenever I should speak to you! [3is about 1For 2Herod] to seek the child  to destroy it.

14.  And having arisen, he took to himself the child and  his mother by night, and he withdrew into Egypt.

15. And he was there until the decease of Herod, that should be fulfilled the thing having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, From out of Egypt I called  my son. 

16.  Herod Kills the Male Babies Then Herod, knowing that he was mocked by the magi, was enraged exceedingly. And having sent, he did away with all the boys, the ones in Bethlehem, and in all the borders of it, from two years old and below, according to the time which was exacted from the magi.

17. Then was fulfilled the thing having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,

18. A voice in Rama was heard, wailing and weeping, and [2grieving 1much], Rachel weeping over  her children, and she wanted not to be comforted, for they are not.

19. [3having come to an end 1And  2Herod], behold, an angel of the Lord by dream appears to Joseph in Egypt,

20. saying, Having arisen, take to yourself the child and  his mother, and go into the land of Israel! [8have died 1for 2the ones 3seeking 4the 5life 6of the 7child]!

21.  And having arisen, he took to himself the child and  his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

22. And having heard that Archelaus reigned over  Judea instead of Herod  his father, he feared to go forth there. And having received a divine message by dream, he withdrew into the parts  of Galilee.

23. And having come, he dwelt in a city being called Nazareth; so that should be fulfilled the thing having been spoken through the prophets, saying, For he shall be called a Nazarene.  

## Matthew 3

1.  John the Baptist Prepares the Way And in  those days came John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness  of Judea,

2. and saying, Repent! [6approaches 1for 2the 3kingdom 4of the 5heavens].

3. For this is the thing having been spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, A voice yelling in the wilderness; Prepare the way of the Lord! [2straight 1Make]  his roads!

4. And he,  John, had  his garment from [2hair 1camel's], and a belt made of skin around  his loin.  And his nourishment was locusts and [2honey 1wild].

5. Then came forth to him Jerusalem, and all  Judea, and all the place round about the Jordan.

6. And they were immersed in the Jordan by him, acknowledging  their sins.

7. And beholding many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming upon  his immersion, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who showed plainly to you to flee from the about to come anger?

8. Do then fruits worthy  of repentance!

9. For you should not seem to say in yourselves, [2father 1We have]  Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able [4from out of  5these stones 1to raise up 2children  3to Abraham].

10. And already even the axe to the root of the trees is situated. For every tree not producing [2fruit 1good], is cut down and [2into 3fire 1thrown].

11. Forasmuch as I immerse you in water for repentance, the one [2after 3me 1coming 5stronger than 6me 4is]; of whom I am not fit [2the 3sandals 1to bear]. He shall immerse you in [2spirit 1holy] and fire --

12. of which the winnowing fan is in  his hand, and he shall thoroughly cleanse  his threshing-floor, and shall gather together  his grain into the storehouse; but the straw he shall incinerate [2fire 1by inextinguishable]. 

13.  John Immerses Jesus Then comes  Jesus from  Galilee unto the Jordan to  John,  to be immersed by him.

14.  And John restrains him, saying, I [2need 1have 4by 5you 3to be immersed], and you come to me?

15. And answering  Jesus said to him, Allow it just now! for to this it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allows him.

16. And Jesus having been immersed, ascended straightway from the water. And behold, [3were opened 4to him 1the 2heavens], and he beheld the spirit  of God coming down as a dove, and coming upon him.

17. And behold, a voice from out of the heavens, saying, This is  my son the beloved, in whom I take pleasure.  

## Matthew 4

1.  The Devil Tests Jesus Then  Jesus was led into the wilderness by the spirit, to be tested by the devil.

2. And he fasted [2days 1forty] and [2nights 1forty]; afterwards he hungered.

3. And having come forward to him, the one testing said, If you are son  of God, speak! that  these stones [2bread loaves 1should become].

4.  And responding he said, It has been written, Not by bread alone shall [2live 1a man], but by every word coming forth by the mouth of God.

5. Then [3takes 4him 1the 2devil] unto the holy city, and he stands him upon the border of the temple.

6. And he says to him, If you are son  of God, throw yourself below! for it has been written that, To his angels he shall give charge concerning you; and by hands they shall lift you, lest at any time you should stumble [2against 3a stone  1your foot].

7. [2said 3to him  1Jesus], Again it has been written, You shall not put to test the Lord  your God.

8. Again [3takes 4him 1the 2devil] unto [3mountain 2high 1an exceedingly], and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world, and  their glory.

9. And he says to him, All these I will give to you, if falling down you should do obeisance to me.

10. Then [2says 3to him  1Jesus], Go behind me Satan! For it is written, [2the Lord  3your God 1You shall do obeisance to], and to him alone you shall serve.

11. Then [3left 4him 1the 2devil]; and behold, angels came forward and served to him. 

12.  The Beginning of Jesus' Ministry [3having heard 1And  2Jesus] that John was delivered up, withdrew into  Galilee.

13. And leaving  Nazareth, coming he dwelt in Capernaum  by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;

14. that [7should be fulfilled 1the 2word 3through 4Isaiah 5the 6prophet], saying,

15. Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan; Galilee of the nations.

16. The people  sitting in darkness beheld [2light 1a great]; and to the ones sitting in a place and shadow of death light arose to them.

17. From then Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent! [6approaches 1for 2the 3kingdom 4of the 5heavens]. 

18.  Jesus Gathers His Disciples [3walking 1And  2Jesus] by the sea  of Galilee, beheld two brothers -- Simon the one being called Peter, and Andrew  his brother, throwing a casting-net into the sea -- for they were fishermen.

19. And he says to them, Come after me! and I will make you fishers of men.

20. And they immediately having left the nets followed him.

21. And advancing from there, he beheld another two brothers -- James the son of Zebedee, and John  his brother, in the boat with Zebedee  their father, readying  their nets; and he called them.

22.  And immediately having left the boat and  their father, they followed him.

23. And [2led about 3all  4Galilee  1Jesus] teaching in  their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every infirmity among the people.

24. And went forth the report of him into all  Syria. And they brought to him all the ones [2an illness 1having] with various diseases, and [2torments 1being held by], and ones being demon-possessed, and ones acting as lunatic, and paralytics; and he cured them.

25. And [3followed 4him 2multitudes 1great] from  Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and on the other side of the Jordan.  

## Matthew 5

1.  Jesus Teaches on the Mount And beholding the multitudes, he ascended into the mountain. And he having sat, there came forward to him  his disciples.

2. And having opened  his mouth, he taught them, saying,

3. Blessed are the poor to the one in spirit, for of them is the kingdom of the heavens.

4. Blessed are the ones mourning, for they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.

6. Blessed are the ones hungering and thirsting  for righteousness, for they shall be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.

8. Blessed are the clean  in heart, for they  shall see God.

9. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they [2sons 3of God 1shall be called].

10. Blessed are the ones having been persecuted because of righteousness, for of them is the kingdom of the heavens.

11. Blessed are you whenever they should berate you, and persecute, and shall say every wicked saying against you in lying, because of me.

12. Rejoice and exult, for  your wage is great in the heavens! for so they persecuted the prophets  before you. 

13.  Salt of the Earth: Light of the World You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt becomes insipid, by what means shall it be salted? For [2nothing 1it is strong for] any longer, unless to be thrown outside, and to be trampled upon by the men.

14. You are the light of the world. [2is not 3able 1A city] to hide [2upon 3a mountain 1being situated];

15. nor do they burn a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but upon the lamp-stand; and it radiates to all the ones in the house.

16. So let radiate the light of your's before  men, so that they should behold your  good works, and they should glorify  your father, the one in the heavens. 

17.  Jesus Teaches Concerning the Law You should not think that I came to depose the law or the prophets. I came not to depose, but to fulfill.

18. For amen I say to you, until whenever shall pass away the heaven and the earth, [2iota 1one] or one dot in no way should pass from the law, until whenever all comes to pass.

19. Who ever then should untie one of the [3commandments 2of these  1least], and shall teach [2so  1men], [2least 1shall be called] in the kingdom of the heavens. And who ever should do and should teach, this one [2great 1shall be called] in the kingdom of the heavens.

20. For I say to you, that if [2should not 3abound  1your righteousness] greater than of the scribes and Pharisees, in no way should you enter into the kingdom of the heavens. 

21.  Murder Begins in the Heart You heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder; and who ever should murder, shall be liable to the judgment.

22. But I say to you, that all  provoking to anger  his brother, in vain, shall be liable to the judgment. And who ever should say to his brother, Worthless! shall be liable to the sanhedrin. And who ever should say O moron! shall be liable for the Gehenna  of fire.

23. If then you should offer  your gift offering upon the altar, and there should remember that  your brother has something against you,

24. leave there  your gift offering before the altar, and go away! first to reconcile with your brother, and then having come offer  your gift offering.

25. Be well-disposed towards  your opponent quickly! at wherever you are in the way with him, lest at any time [3should deliver you up 1the 2opponent] to the judge, and the judge should deliver you up to the officer, and [2into 3prison 1he should throw you].

26. Amen I say to you, In no way should you come forth from there, until whenever you should deliver over the last quadrans. 

27.  Adultery Begins in the Heart You heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not commit adultery.

28. But I say to you that, all  looking at a wife for  lusting her, already committed adultery with her in  his heart.

29. And if  [3eye 1your  2right] causes you to stumble, take it out, and throw it from you! for it is advantageous to you that [3should be destroyed 1one  2of your members], and [4should not 2entire  3body 1your] be thrown into Gehenna.

30. And if  your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it from you! for it is advantageous to you that [3should be destroyed 1one  2of your members], and [4should not 2entire  3body 1your] be thrown into Gehenna. 

31.  Dismissing a Wife Also it was said that, Who ever should dismiss  his wife, let him give to her a certificate of divorce.

32. But I say to you that, Who ever should dismiss  his wife, except for the matter of harlotry, makes her to commit adultery. And who ever [2a woman being divorced 1should marry] commits adultery. 

33.  Jesus Teaches on Oaths Again, you heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not swear upon, but shall render to the Lord  your oaths.

34. But I say to you, Do not swear by an oath wholly; nor on the heaven, for it is the throne  of God;

35. nor on the earth, for it is the footstool  of his feet; nor on Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king;

36. nor on  your head should you swear by an oath, for you are not able [2one 3hair 4white 5or 6black 1to make].

37. But let be  your word -- a yes, Yes! a no, No! but anything extra than these [2of 3the 4wicked one 1is]. 

38.  An Eye for an Eye You heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

39. But I say to you, to not oppose the wicked one. But whoever slaps you upon  your right jaw, turn to him also the other!

40. And to the one wanting to arbitrate against you, and  [2your garment 1to take], leave to him also your cloak!

41. And whoever conscripts you to go [2mile 1one], go with him two!

42. To the one asking you, give! And the one wanting from you to borrow, you should not turn away.

43. You heard that it was said, You shall love  your neighbor, and you shall detest  your enemy.

44. But I say to you, Love  your enemies! Bless the ones cursing you! [2well 1Do] to the ones detesting you! and pray for the ones threatening you and persecuting you!

45. so that you should become sons  of your father, of the one in the heavens. For  his sun rises upon wicked ones and good ones, and it rains upon the just and unjust.

46. For if you should love the ones loving you, what wage have you? Do not also the tax collectors do the same?

47. And if you should greet  your brethren only, what extra do you do? Do not also the tax collectors [2the 3same 1do]?

48. You shall be then yourselves perfect, as  your father, the one in the heavens is perfect.  

## Matthew 6

1.  Charity Done in Secret Take heed  of your charity! to not act in front of  men so as to be a spectacle to them, otherwise [2a wage 1you have not] from  your father, the one in the heavens.

2. Whenever then you should do charity, you should not trump before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they should be glorified by  men. Amen I say to you, they receive  their wage.

3. But you doing charity, let not [2know  1your left hand] what [2does  1your right]!

4. so that [3might be 1your  2charity] in the secret; and  your father, the one seeing in the secret, he will recompense to you in the open. 

5.  Prayer and Fasting And whenever you pray, you should not be as the hypocrites; for they are fond of being in the synagogues, and in the corners of the squares standing to pray, so that they should appear to the men. Amen, I say to you that they receive  their wage.

6. But you, whenever you should pray, enter into  your inner chamber, and having locked  your door, pray to your father, to the one in the secret place; and  your father, the one seeing in the secret place shall recompense to you in the open!

7. And praying, do not repeat over and over as the heathen; for they think that by the many words of theirs they shall be listened to.

8. You should not then be like them; [3knows 1for  2your father] of what [2need 1you have] before  you ask him.

9. So then you pray! Our father, the one in the heavens, sanctify  your name!

10. Let [2come  1your kingdom]! Let [2come to pass  1your will] as in heaven also upon the earth!

11.  Our bread, the sufficient, give to us today!

12. And forgive us  our debts! as also we forgive  our debtors.

13. And do not insert us for a test, but rescue us from the wicked one! For of you is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, into the eons, amen.

14. For if you should forgive  men  their transgressions, [4shall also forgive 5you  3father 1your  2heavenly].

15. But if you should not forgive  men  their transgressions, not even  [4father 2your  3heavenly 1shall] forgive  your transgressions.

16. And whenever you should fast, be not as the hypocrites, looking downcast! for they obliterate  their faces, so as to appear  to men as fasting. Amen I say to you, that they receive  their wage.

17. But you, fasting, anoint your  head, and  [2your face 1wash]!

18. so that you should not appear to men as fasting, but to your father, to the one in the secret. And  your father, the one seeing in the secret, shall recompense to you in the open. 

19.  Treasures in Heaven Treasure not to yourself treasures upon the earth! where moth and rust obliterate, and where thieves dig through and steal.

20. But treasure up to yourself treasures in heaven! where neither moth nor rust obliterate, and where thieves do not dig through nor steal.

21. For where [2is  1your treasure], there will be also  your heart.

22. The lamp of the body is the eye. If then  your eye should be sincere, [2entire  3body 1your 5giving light 4will be].

23. But if  your eye should be evil, [2entire  3body 1your] will be dark. If then the light, the one in you, is darkness, [2the 3darkness 1how great]?

24. No one is able [2two 3masters 1to serve]; for the one he will detest, and the other love; or the one he will hold to, and the other he will disdain; you are not able to serve God and mammon. 

25.  Be Not Anxious On account of this I say to you, Be not anxious  for your life! what you should eat, and what you should drink; nor to your body, what you should put on. [2not  3life 4more 1Is] than nourishment, and the body more than a garment?

26. Look at the birds of the heaven! for they do not sow, nor do they harvest, nor do they gather together into storehouses; and  [3father 1your  2heavenly] maintains them. Are you therefore rather different than them?

27. And who of you being anxious is able to add unto  his stature [2cubit 1one]?

28. And concerning a garment, why are you anxious? Study the lilies of the field! how they grow; they do not tire nor spin.

29. And I say to you that not even Solomon in all  his glory was clothed as one of these.

30. But if the grass of the field today is being, and tomorrow [2into 3an oven 1is being thrown], and God so clothes them, will he not much rather you, O ones of little belief?

31. Do not then be anxious! saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or what should be worn?

32. For all these things the nations seek anxiously. [5knows 1For  4father 2your  3heavenly] that you need these things all together.

33. But seek first the kingdom  of God and  his righteousness! and all these things will be added to you.

34. You should not then be anxious for  tomorrow;  for tomorrow shall be anxious for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil of it.  

## Matthew 7

1.  Judging Judge not that you should not be judged!

2. [2by 3what 1For] judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and by what measure you measure, it shall be measured back to you.

3. But why do you see the speck, the one in the eye  of your brother, but the [2in  3your 4eye 1beam] you do not contemplate?

4. Or how shall you say to your brother, Allow me to cast out the speck from  your eye; and behold, the beam is in  your eye?

5. Hypocrite, cast out first the beam from  your eye! and then you shall see clearly to cast out the speck from the eye  of your brother.

6. You should not give the holy to the dogs; nor should you throw  your pearls before the swine, lest at any time they shall trample them with  their feet, and having turned should tear you. 

7.  Ask, Seek, and Knock Ask! and it shall be given to you. Seek! and you shall find. Knock! and it shall be opened to you.

8. For every one  asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking it shall be opened.

9. Or who is it of you, being a man, whom ever [2should ask  1his son] for bread,  [3a stone 1shall give 2to him]?

10. And if [2a fish 1he shall ask for],  [3a serpent 1shall give 2to him]?

11. If then, you being wicked, know [3gifts 2good 1to give] to your children, how much rather  your father, the one in the heavens shall give good things to the ones asking him?

12. All things then, as much as you should want that [2should do 3to you  1men], so also you do to them! for this is the law and the prophets. 

13.  Enter the Narrow Gate Enter through the narrow gate! for spacious is the gate, and broad is the way  leading unto the destruction, and many are the ones entering through it.

14. For narrow is the gate, and being afflicted is the way, the one leading unto the life, and few are the ones finding it.

15. And take heed of the false prophets! the ones who come to you in garments of sheep, but inside they are [2wolves 1predacious].

16. From  their fruits you shall recognize them. Do they collect together [2from 3thorn-bushes 1the grape], or [2from 3thistles 1figs]?

17. Thus every [2tree 1good 5fruits 4good 3produces], but the rotten tree [3fruits 2bad 1produces].

18. [3is not 4able 2tree 1A good 7fruits 6bad 5to produce], nor [2tree 1a rotten 5fruits 4good 3to produce].

19. All trees not producing [2fruit 1good] are cut down, and [2into 3a fire 1thrown].

20. Yes, it is so -- from their fruits you shall recognize them.

21. Not all  saying to me, O Lord, O Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but the one doing the will  of my father, the one in the heavens.

22. Many shall say to me in that  day, O Lord, O Lord, [2not 4in 5your 6name 1did we 3prophesy], and in your name [2demons 1cast out], and in your name [3powerful works 2many 1do]?

23. And then I will acknowledge to them that, At no time I knew you. Retreat from me! O ones working  lawlessness. 

24.  Build upon the Rock Every one then whoever hears [2my  3words 1these], and does them, I shall liken him [2man 1to a practical], one who built  his house upon the rock.

25. And [3came down 1the 2rain], and [3came 1the 2rivers], and [3blew 1the 2winds], and they fell on  that house, and it did not fall; for the foundation was laid upon the rock.

26. And all  hearing [2my  3words 1these], and not doing them, shall be likened [2man 1to a moronish], one who built  his house upon the sand.

27. And [3came down 1the 2rain], and [3came 1the 2rivers], and [3blew 1the 2winds], and they struck against  that house, and it fell, and [3was  2downfall 1its] great.

28. And it came to pass when Jesus completed  these words, [3were overwhelmed 1the 2multitudes] by  his teaching;

29. for he was teaching them as [2authority 1one having], and not as the scribes.  

## Matthew 8

1.  Jesus Cleanses the Leper [3coming down 1And 2in his] from the mountain, [3followed 4him 2multitude 1a great].

2. And behold, a leper, having come, did obeisance to him, saying, O Lord, if you should want, you are able to cleanse me.

3. And stretching out the hand, [2touched 3him  1Jesus], saying, I want, be cleansed! And immediately he was cleansed of his  leprosy.

4. And [2says 3to him  1Jesus], See that [2no one 1you tell]! But go [2yourself 1show] to the priest, and offer the gift offering! the one Moses assigned for a testimony to them. 

5.  The Believing Centurion [3having entered 1And  2Jesus] into Capernaum, came forward to him a centurion enjoining him,

6. and saying, O Lord,  my servant is lying in the house a paralytic, [2awfully 1being tormented].

7. And [2says 3to him  1Jesus], I coming shall cure him.

8. And responding the centurion said, O Lord, I am not fit that [2under my  3roof 1you should enter]; but only speak the word! and [2shall be healed  1my servant].

9. [3also 1For 2I 5a man 4am] under authority, having under myself soldiers. And I say to this one, Go! and he goes. And to another, Come! and he comes. And to my manservant, Do this! and he does.

10. And hearing,  Jesus marveled, and he said to the ones following, Amen I say to you, not even in  Israel [2such great 3belief 1did I find].

11. And I say to you, that many from east and west shall come, and shall be lain down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.

12. But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the [2darkness  1outer]; there, there shall be  weeping and the gnashing  of teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go! and as you trusted let it be to you! And [2was healed  1his servant] in  that hour. 

14.  Jesus Heals Peter's Mother-in-law And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, he beheld  his mother-in-law lying and having a fever.

15. And he touched  her hand, and [3left 4her 1the 2fever]; and she arose, and served to them.

16. [3late 1And 2becoming], they brought near to him [2being demon-possessed 1many]; and he cast out the spirits by a word; and all  [2an illness 1having] he cured;

17. so that might be fulfilled the thing having been spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying, He himself  [2our weaknesses 1took], and [2the 3diseases 1he bore].

18. [3beholding 1And  2Jesus] great multitudes around him, bid to go forth unto the other side.

19. And having come forward, one scribe said to him, Teacher, I will follow you where ever you should go forth.

20. And [2says 3to him  1Jesus], The foxes [2dens 1have], and the birds of the heaven shelters; but the son  of man has not where [2the 3head 1he should lean].

21. And another  of his disciples said to him, O Lord, commit to my care to me first to go forth and bury  my father!

22.  And Jesus said to him, Follow me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead! 

23.  Jesus Calms the Storm And in his stepping into the boat, [2followed 3him  1his disciples].

24. And behold, [2quaking 1a great] took place on the sea, so as to  [2the boat 1cover] under the waves; but he was sleeping.

25. And [2coming forward  1his disciples] roused him, saying, O Lord, save us! we perish.

26. And he says to them, Why are you timid, O ones of little belief? Then having arisen, he reproached the winds and the sea; and there became [2calm 1a great].

27. And the men marveled, saying, What kind is this one, that even the winds and the sea obey him? 

28.  The Demon Possessed Men of the Gergesenes And in his coming unto the other side, unto the place of the Gergesenes, there encountered to him two demon-possessed, [2from out of 3the 4sepulchres 1coming forth], [2ill-tempered 1exceedingly], so that not were able any to go by  that way.

29. And behold, they cried out, saying, What is it to us and to you, Jesus, O son  of God? Are you come here before time to torment us?

30. And there was far from them a herd of swine, many grazing.

31. And the daimons enjoined him, saying, If you cast us out, commission us to go forth into the herd of the swine.

32. And he said to them, Go! And having gone forth, they departed into the herd of the swine. And behold, advanced all the herd of the swine down the precipice into the sea, and they died in the waters.

33. And the ones grazing fled. And having gone forth into the city, they reported all, and the things of the ones being demon-possessed.

34. And behold, all the city came forth to meet with  Jesus. And seeing him, they enjoined him how he should cross over from  their borders.  

## Matthew 9

1.  Jesus Heals the Paralytic And stepping into the boat, he passed through, and came unto  his own city.

2. And behold, they brought to him a paralytic [2upon 3a bed 1lying]. And Jesus beholding  their belief, said to the paralytic, Courage child! [3have been forgiven 4you  2sins 1your]!

3. And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, This one blasphemes.

4. And Jesus knowing  their thinking, said, Why do you ponder wicked things in  your hearts?

5. For what is easier, to say, [3have been forgiven 4you 1The 2sins]; or to say, Arise and walk!

6. But so that you should know that [5authority 4has 1the 2son  3of man] over the earth to forgive sins -- then he says to the paralytic, Having arisen, lift up your  bed, and go unto  your house!

7. And having arisen, he went forth unto  his house.

8. [4having seen 1And 2the 3multitudes] marveled, and they glorified  God, the one giving [2authority 1such]  to men. 

9.  Matthew the Tax Collector And Jesus passing by there beheld a man sitting down at the tax collector's station, being called Matthew. And he says to him, Follow me! And having arisen, he followed him.

10. And it came to pass of his reclining in the house. And behold, many tax collectors and sinners having come were reclining together with  Jesus and  his disciples.

11. And the Pharisees seeing, said to his disciples, Why with the tax collectors and sinners does [3eat  2teacher 1your]?

12.  And Jesus having heard, said to them, [4no 5need 3have 1The ones 2being strong] of a physician, but the ones [2illnesses 1having] do.

13. But having gone learn what it is said, Mercy I want, and not sacrifice! [3not 1For not 2I came] to call the righteous, but sinners unto repentance.

14. Then came forward to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much,  but your disciples do not fast?

15. And [2said 3to them  1Jesus], [5are not 6able 1the 2sons 3of the 4bridal chamber] to mourn as long as [4with 5them 3is 1the 2groom]. But there shall come days whenever [3departs 4from 5them 1the 2groom], and then they shall fast.

16. But no one puts a piece of cloth [2rag 1of an unshrunk] upon [2garment 1an old], [5lifts away 1for 2the 3fullness 4of it] from the garment, and [3worse 1the split 2becomes].

17. Nor do they throw [2wine 1new] into [2leather bags 1old]; otherwise [3are torn 1the 2leather bags], and the wine pours out, and the leather bags they destroy. But they cast [2wine 1new] into [2leather bags 1new], and both are preserved together. 

18.  The Woman with the Flow Healed [3these things 1In his 2speaking] to them, behold, [2ruler 1one] having come, did obeisance to him, saying that,  My daughter just now came to an end; but having come, place  your hand upon her! and she shall live.

19. And Jesus having arisen, he followed him and  his disciples.

20. And behold, a woman hemorrhaging twelve years, having come forward behind, touched the decorative hem  of his cloak.

21. For she said in herself, If only I should touch  his cloak, I shall be delivered.

22.  And Jesus having turned, and beholding her, said, Courage daughter!  your belief has delivered you. And [3was delivered 1the 2woman] from  that hour. 

23.  Jesus Raises the Ruler's Daughter And Jesus having come into the house of the ruler, and beholding the pipers and the multitude making a disruption,

24. he says to them, Withdraw! [5not 1for 4died 2the 3young woman], but sleeps. And they ridiculed him.

25. But when [3was cast out 1the 2multitude], having entered, he held  her hand, and [3arose 1the 2young woman].

26. And went forth  this reputation into [2entire  3land 1that].

27. And [2passing 3from there 1in the] of Jesus, there followed him two blind men, crying out and saying, Show mercy upon us, O son of David!

28. And having come into the house, there came forward to him the blind men. And [2says 3to them  1Jesus], Do you trust that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yes, O Lord.

29. Then he touched  their eyes, saying, According to  your belief let it be to you!

30. And [3were opened 1their  2eyes]; and [2strictly charged 3them  1Jesus], saying, See you let no one know!

31. And they, having gone forth, spread of him abroad in [2entire  3land 1that].

32. And of their going forth, behold, they brought near to him [2man 1a mute] being demon-possessed.

33. And having been cast out of the demon possessed man, [3spoke 1the 2mute]. And [3marveled 1the 2multitudes], saying, At no time was such shown forth in  Israel.

34. But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.

35. And Jesus went about [2the 3cities 1all] and the towns, teaching in  their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease, and every infirmity.

36. And having beheld the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, for they were fainting and dropping as sheep not having a shepherd.

37. Then he says to his disciples, For sure the harvest is great, but the workers few;

38. beseech then of the Lord of the harvest, so that he should cast workers into  his harvest.  

## Matthew 10

1.  Authority Given to the Twelve Disciples And having called on  [2twelve 3disciples 1his], he gave to them authority [2spirits 1of unclean], so as to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every infirmity.

2. And of the twelve apostles, the names are these; first Simon the one being called Peter, and Andrew  his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John  his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus the one called Thaddaeus;

4. Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, the one also having delivered him up.

5. These  twelve Jesus sent, exhorting them, saying, Unto the way of the nations you should not go forth, and unto a city of Samaritans you should not enter. 

6.  Jesus Sends the Twelve But you go rather to the [2sheep  1lost] of the house of Israel!

7. And going, proclaim! saying that, [5approaches 1The 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens].

8. Ones being weak cure! Dead raise up! Leprous cleanse! Demons cast out! Freely you received, freely you give!

9. You should not acquire gold, nor silver, nor brass coin in  your belts,

10. nor a provision bag for the way, nor two inner garments, nor sandals, nor rods; [5worth 1for 2the 3worker  6his provision 4is].

11. And into whatever city or town you should enter, inquire diligently who in it is worthy, and there remain until whenever you should go forth!

12. And entering into the house, greet it!

13. And if indeed [3might be 1the 2house] worthy, let [2come  1your peace] upon it! But if it might not be worthy,  [2your peace 4to 5you 1let 3return]!

14. And who ever should not receive you, nor should hear  your words, in going forth from the residence or  that city, shake off the dust  of your feet!

15. Amen I say to you, More endurable will it be to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than to that city. 

16.  Sheep among Wolves Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be then skilled as the serpents, and unmixed as the doves!

17. And take heed of the men! for they shall deliver you unto sanhedrins, and in  their synagogues they shall whip you.

18. And before governors also and kings you shall be led because of me, for a testimony to them and to the nations.

19. And whenever they deliver you, be not anxious how or what you should speak; for it shall be given to you in that  hour what you should speak;

20. [4not 1for 2you 3are] the ones speaking, but the spirit  of your father, the one speaking in you.

21. [3shall deliver up 1But 2brother] brother unto death, and a father a child. And [2shall rise up 1children] against parents, and shall put them to death.

22. And you will be detested by all on account of  my name. But the one remaining unto completion, this one shall be delivered.

23. But whenever they should persecute you in  this city, flee unto the other! For amen I say to you, In no way should you finish the cities  of Israel, until whenever [4should come 1the 2son  3of man].

24. [3not 2is 1A disciple] above the teacher, nor a servant above  his master.

25. Sufficient to the disciple that he should become as  his teacher, and the servant as  his master. If [3the 4master of the house 2Beelzebub 1they invoked], how much more the ones of his house?

26. You should not then fear them; for nothing is being covered, which shall not be uncovered; and hidden, which shall not be known.

27. What I say to you in the darkness, you speak in the light! and what in the ear you hear, proclaim upon the roofs! 

28.  Fear God And fear not of the ones killing the body, [5the 1but 6soul 2not 3being able 4to kill]! But you fear rather the one being able both the soul and body to destroy in Gehenna!

29. Are not two sparrows [2an assarion 1sold for]? and one of them shall not fall upon the earth without  your father.

30. But you, even the hairs of the head [2all 3counted 1are].

31. Do not then fear! [2than many 3sparrows 1you differ].

32. Every one then whoever shall acknowledge being mine before  men, I shall acknowledge, even myself, him before  my father, of the one in heavens.

33. And whoever should deny me before the men, I shall deny him, even myself, before  my father, the one in the heavens.

34. You should not think that I came to cast peace upon the earth; I came not to cast peace, but a sword.

35. For I came to cleave a man against  his father, and a daughter against  her mother, and a daughter-in-law against  her mother-in-law;

36. and the enemies of the man are the ones of his own house.

37. The one being fond of a father or mother above me, is not worthy of me; and the one being fond of a son or daughter above me, is not worthy of me.

38. And the one who does not take  his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.

39. The one finding  his life, shall lose it; and the one losing  his life, because of me, shall find it.

40. The one receiving you, receives me; and the one receiving me, receives the one sending me.

41. The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet, [2a wage 3of a prophet 1shall receive]; and the one receiving a just one in the name of a just one, [2a wage 3of a just one 1shall receive].

42. And who ever shall give a drink to one  of these small ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, In no way shall he lose  his wage.  

## Matthew 11

1.  John the Baptist Sends Disciples to Jesus And it came to pass when Jesus finished setting in order  [2twelve 3disciples 1his], he crossed over from there  to teach and to proclaim in  their cities.

2.  And John having heard in the jail the works of the Christ, having sent two  of his disciples,

3. he said to him, Are you the coming one, or [2another 1are we expecting]?

4. And answering  Jesus said to them, Having gone report to John what you hear and see!

5. the blind look up, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and deaf-mutes hear; dead are raised, and poor are announced good news.

6. And blessed is who ever should not be offended in me. 

7.  Jesus Speaks Concerning John the Baptist And these having gone, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you come forth into the wilderness to see? a reed [2by 3the wind 1being shaken]?

8. But what did you come forth to behold? a man [2in 3soft 4garments 1being clothed]? Behold, the ones  [2soft garments 1wearing 4in 5the 6houses 7of the 8palaces 3are].

9. But what did you come forth to behold? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more extra of a prophet.

10. For this it is concerning of whom it has been written, Behold, I send  my messenger before your face, who shall carefully prepare  your way before you.

11. Amen I say to you, There has not been arisen among ones born of women greater than John the Baptist; but the lesser in the kingdom of the heavens [2greater than 3he 1is].

12. And from the days of John the Baptist until just now the kingdom of the heavens is forced, and [2by assailants 1is snatched].

13. For all the prophets and the law [2until 3John 1prophesied].

14. And if you want to receive, he is Elijah, the one being about to come.

15. The one having ears to hear, let him hear!

16. But what shall I liken  this generation? It is likened to boys in a market sitting down and calling out to  their companions.

17. And they say, We piped for you, and you did not dance; we wailed for you, and you did not beat your chest.

18. [3came 1For 2John] neither eating nor drinking, and they say, [2a demon 1He has].

19. [4came 1The 2son  3of man] eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, the man is a glutton and a winebibber, [2of tax collectors 1a friend] and sinners. And [2was justified  1wisdom] by  her children. 

20.  Woe to the Unrepentant Cities Then he began to berate the cities in which took place the most of his works of power, for they did not repent.

21. Woe to you, Chorazin, woe to you, Bethsaida, For if in Tyre and Sidon took place the works of powers  having taken place in you, earlier indeed in sackcloth and ashes they would have repented.

22. Only I say to you, [2to Tyre 3and 4Sidon 1It will be more endurable] in the day of judgment than to you.

23. And you, Capernaum, the place [2unto 3the 4heaven 1raised up high], unto Hades you shall be brought down; for if in Sodom took place the works of power, the ones taking place in you, they would have remained until  today.

24. Only I say to you that [2to the land 3of Sodom 1It will be more endurable] in day of judgment, than to you. 

25.  The Son Reveals the Father In that  time Jesus responding said, I make acknowledgment to you, father, O Lord of the heaven and the earth, that you concealed these things from the wise and discerning, and uncovered them to simple ones.

26. Yes, O father, for so it was benevolent before you.

27. All things to me were delivered up by  my father. And no one recognizes the son, were it not for the father. Not even [3the 4father 1any 2recognizes], were it not for the son, and to whom ever [3should will 1the 2son] to reveal.

28. Come to me all  ones tiring and being loaded down, and I will cause you rest!

29. Lift  my yoke upon you, and learn from me! for I am gentle and humble in the heart, and you shall find rest  for your souls.

30.  For my yoke is gracious, and  my load is light.  

## Matthew 12

1.  Jesus is Master of the Sabbath In that  time Jesus went on the Sabbaths through the corn-fields.  And his disciples hungered, and they began to pluck ears of corn and to eat.

2. And the Pharisees seeing, said to him, Behold,  your disciples do what is not allowed to do on the Sabbath.

3.  And he said to them, Did you not read what David did when he hungered and the ones with him?

4. How he entered into the house  of God, and the bread loaves of the place setting he ate, which [2not 3allowable 1was] for him to eat, nor to the ones with him, except for the priests alone?

5. Or did you not read in the law, that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple [2the 3Sabbath 1profane], and they are innocent?

6. But I say to you that [2the 3temple 1a greater than] is here.

7. And if you had known what it is, Mercy I want and not sacrifice; you would not have judged against the innocent.

8. [6master 1For 5is 7of the 8Sabbath 2the 3son  4of man].

9. And having crossed over from there, he came into  their synagogue. 

10.  Jesus Heals the Man with the Withered Hand And behold, there was a man  [2a hand 1having] withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it allowed on the Sabbaths to cure? that they should charge him.

11.  And he said to them, What [2will be 3of 4you 1man] who shall have [2sheep 1one], and if this one should fall on the Sabbaths into a cistern, shall not grab hold of it and raise it?

12. How much then differs a man than a sheep? So that it is allowed [3on the 4Sabbaths 2well 1to do].

13. Then he says to the man, Stretch out  your hand! And he stretched it out, and it was restored in health as the other.

14. And the Pharisees [2council 1took] against him, having gone forth, how they should destroy him.

15.  But Jesus having known he withdrew from there. And [3followed 4him 2multitudes 1great], and he cured them all.

16. And he gave reproach to them that [2not 3openly 5him known 1they should 4make],

17. so that should be fulfilled the thing having been spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

18. Behold,  my child whom I selected,  my beloved for whom [2takes pleasure in  1my soul]; I will put  my spirit upon him, and [2judgment 3to the 4nations 1he will report].

19. He shall not contend nor cry out, nor shall anyone hear [2in 3the 4squares  1his voice].

20. A reed being broken he shall not break away, and [2flax 1smoldering] he shall not extinguish, until whenever he should cast forth [2into 3victory  1equity].

21. And in  his name nations shall hope.

22. Then was brought to him one being demon-possessed, blind and mute. And he cured him, so as for the blind and mute one even to speak and to see.

23. And [4were amazed 1all 2the 3multitudes] and said, [2not 3this 1Is] the Christ, the son of David? 

24.  The Pharisees Question Jesus But the Pharisees having heard, said, This one does not cast out the demons, except by  Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.

25. [3knowing 1But  2Jesus]  their thinking, said to them, Every kingdom portioned out against itself is made desolate. And every city or house being portioned out against itself shall not be left standing.

26. And if  Satan  [2Satan 1casts out], [2against 3himself 1he portions]; how then shall [2be left standing  1his kingdom]?

27. And if I by Beelzebul cast out the demons,  [2do your sons 1by what means] cast out? On account of this they will be your judges.

28. But if I by spirit of God cast out the demons, surely then came upon you the kingdom  of God.

29. Or how is anyone able to enter into the house  of a strong man and  [2his equipment 1plunder], if not first he ties up the strong man? And then  [2his house 1he shall plunder]?

30. The one not being with me [2against 3me 1is], and the one not gathering together with me disperses. 

31.  Blasphemy of the Spirit On account of this I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to the men; but the [2of the 3spirit 1blasphemy] shall not be forgiven to the men.

32. And whoever should say a word against the son  of man, it shall be forgiven him; but the one who should speak against the [2spirit  1holy], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in the present eon, nor in the one about to be.

33. Then make the tree good, and  its fruit good; or make the tree rotten, and  its fruit rotten! For of the fruit the tree is known.

34. Offspring of vipers, how are you able [2good things 1to speak], being wicked? For from out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. The good man from the good treasury of the heart casts forth the good things; and the wicked man from the wicked treasury casts forth the wicked things.

36. But I say to you that every [2saying 1rough], which ever [2shall speak  1men], they shall render for it a reckoning in the day of judgment.

37. For by  your words you shall be justified, and by  your words you shall be condemned. 

38.  The Wicked Seek a Sign Then answered some of the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher, we want [3from 4you 2a sign 1to see].

39. And he answering said to them, A generation wicked and adulterous [2a sign 1seeks anxiously]; and a sign shall not be given it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

40. For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will [4be 1the 2son  3of man] in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.

41. Ninevite men shall rise up in the judgment with  this generation and shall condemn it, for they repented at the proclamation of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

42. The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with  this generation and shall condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

43. But whenever the unclean spirit should go forth from the man, it goes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find.

44. Then it says, I will return unto  my house from where I came forth. And having come it finds relaxing, being swept, and being adorned.

45. Then it goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than itself. And entering it dwells there; and becomes the last  of that man worse than the first. So it will be also to [3generation 1this  2evil]. 

46.  Jesus' Mother and Brothers And yet of his speaking to the multitudes, behold, the mother and  his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.

47. And said a certain one to him, Behold,  your mother and  your brothers are outside standing, seeking to speak to you.

48. And he responding said to the one speaking to him, Who is  my mother, and who are  my brothers?

49. And stretching out  his hand unto  his disciples, he said, Behold,  my mother and  my brothers.

50. For who ever should do the will  of my father, of the one in heavens, he [2my 3brother 4and 5sister 6and 7mother 1is].  

## Matthew 13

1.  The Parable of the Sower And in  that day, Jesus having gone forth from the house, sat down by the sea.

2. And were gathered together with him [2multitudes 1great], so that he [2into 3the 4boat 1having stepped] sat down; and all the multitude [2upon 3the 4shore 1stood].

3. And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, came forth the one sowing  to sow.

4. And in  his sowing, some seed indeed fell by the way, and [3came 1the 2birds] and ate them.

5. And others fell upon the rocky places, where it did not have [2earth 1much]. And immediately it rose up, on account of the not having a depth of earth.

6. But the sun having risen scorched it; and on account of the not having root it was dried up.

7. And others fell by the thorn-bushes, and [3ascended 1the 2thorn-bushes] and choked them.

8. And others fell upon the [2earth  1good], and yielded fruit; some indeed a hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty.

9. The one having ears to hear, let him hear! 

10.  The Purpose of Parables And having come, the disciples said to him, Why in parables do you speak to them?

11. And he answering said to them that, To you has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those it has not been given.

12. For whosoever has, it shall be given to him, and he shall abound; but whosoever does not have, even what he has shall be lifted from him.

13. On account of this [2in 3parables 1I speak to them]. For seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor perceive.

14. And is fulfilled by them the prophecy of Isaiah, the one saying, Hearing you shall hear, and in no way should you perceive; and seeing you shall see, and in no way should you know.

15. [5was thickened 1For 2the 3heart  4of this people], and with the ears heavily they heard, and  [2of their eyes 1they closed the eyelids]; lest at any time they should see with the eyes, and with the ears should hear, and the heart should perceive, and they should turn, and I shall heal them.

16. [3your 1But 2blessed are]  eyes, for they see, and  your ears, for they hear.

17. For amen I say to you, that many prophets and just ones desired to behold what you see, and beheld not; and to hear what you hear, and heard not.

18. You then hear the parable of the one sowing.

19. Every one hearing the word of the kingdom, and not perceiving, there comes the evil one, and seizes by force the thing being sown in  his heart. This is the one by the way being sown.

20. And the one by the rocky places being sown, this is the one [2the 3word 1hearing], and straightway with joy receives it;

21. [2he has no 1but] root in himself, but is temporary. [3taking place 1And 2affliction] or persecution on account of the word, straightway he is caused to stumble.

22. And the one in the thorn-bushes being sown, this is the one [2the 3word 1hearing], and the anxiety  of this eon, and the deception  of riches chokes out the word, and [2unfruitful 1he becomes].

23. But the one [2upon 3the 5earth  4good 1being sown], this is the one [2the 3word 1hearing], and perceiving; who indeed bears fruit, and produces some indeed a hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty. 

24.  The Parable of the Tares Another parable he pointed out to them, saying, [5is like 1The 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens] a man sowing good seed in  his field.

25. And during the sleeping of the men, [3came 1his  2enemy] and sowed tares in the midst of the grain, and went forth.

26. And when [3burst forth 1the 2blade], and [2fruit 1produced], then appeared also the tares.

27. And coming forward, the manservants of the master of the house said to him, O Master, was it not good seed you sowed in  your field? from where then have the tares?

28. And he said to them, an enemy, a man did this. And the manservants said to him, Do you want then having gone forth we gather them?

29. And he said, No, lest gathering the tares you should root out together with them the grain.

30. Allow [2to grow together 1both] until the harvest! And at the time of the harvest I will say to the harvesters, Gather together first the tares, and tie them into a bundle so as  to incinerate them! but the grain you gather together unto  my storehouse! 

31.  The Parable of the Mustard Seed Another parable he pointed out to them, saying, [5is likened 1The 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens] to a kernel of mustard, which [2having taken 1a man], sowed in  his field;

32. the one which [3lesser 1indeed 2is] of all the seeds; but whenever it should grow, [4greater 1the 2vegetation 3is], and it becomes a tree, so as for [5to come 1the 2birds 3of the 4heaven] and encamp in  its branches. 

33.  The Parable of the Yeast Another parable he spoke to them, [5is likened 1The 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens] to yeast, which having taken, a woman hides in [3of flour 2seahs 1three], until of which time [2is leavened 1the entire amount].

34. All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes, and without the help of parables he did not speak to them.

35. So that should be fulfilled the thing having been spoken through the prophet, saying, I shall open in parables  my mouth; I will bellow things being hidden from the founding of the world.

36. Then dismissing the multitudes, [2went 3into 4the 5house  1Jesus]. And came forward to him  his disciples, saying, Expound to us the parable of the tares of the field.

37. And answering he said to them, The one sowing the good seed is the son  of man;

38. and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the wicked one;

39. and the enemy, the one sowing them is the devil; and the harvest [2the completion 3of the 4age 1is]; and the harvesters are angels.

40. As then [3are collected together 1the 2tares 4and 6in fire 5incinerated], so it will be in the completion  of this eon.

41. [4shall send forth 1The 2son  3of man]  his angels, and they shall gather together from  his kingdom all the ones causing offence, and the ones committing  lawlessness.

42. And they shall throw them into the furnace of the fire; there, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

43. Then the just shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom  of their father. The one having ears to hear let him hear! 

44.  The Parables of the Treasure, Pearl and Dragnet Again [5is likened 1the 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens] to a treasure being hidden in the field, which having found a man hid, and from the joy of it goes and all as much as he has he sells, and he buys  that field.

45. Again [5is likened 1the 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens] to a man, a merchant seeking good pearls;

46. who having found one valuable pearl, having gone forth sells all as much as he has, and buys it.

47. Again [5is likened 1the 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens] to a dragnet being thrown into the sea, and of every kind gathering together;

48. which when it was filled, having been hauled upon the shore, and having sat down they gather together the good things into receptacles, and the rotten [2out 1they throw].

49. Thus shall it be in the completion of the age; [3shall go forth 1the 2angels], and they shall separate the evil ones from the midst of the righteous.

50. And they shall throw them into the furnace of the fire; there, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

51. [2says 3to them  1Jesus], Do you perceive all these things? They say to him, Yes, O Lord.

52.  And he said to them, On account of this every scribe discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is likened to a man, a master of a house, who casts out from  his treasury new and old.

53. And it came to pass when Jesus finished  these parables, he moved on from there.

54. And having come into  his fatherland, he taught them in  their synagogue, so as to overwhelm them, and for them to say, From what place is this one,  this wisdom, and the works of power?

55. [2not 1Is this] the [2of the 3fabricator 1son]? Is not  his mother called Mary, and  his brothers James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

56. And  his sisters, [2not 3all 4with 5us 1are they]? From where then [3to this one 2these things 1are all]?

57. And they were offended by him.  But Jesus said to them, [2is not 1A prophet] without honor, except in  his fatherland, and in  his house.

58. And he did not do there [2works of power 1many] because of  their unbelief.  

## Matthew 14

1.  John the Baptist is Beheaded In that  time [4heard 1Herod 2the 3tetrarch] the report of Jesus.

2. And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and because of this the works of power are exerted in him.

3.  For Herod having held  John, bound him and put him in prison, on account of Herodias the wife of Philip  his brother.

4. [3said 1For 4to him  2John], It is not allowed to you to have her.

5. And wanting to kill him, he feared the multitude, for [3as 4a prophet 2him 1they held].

6. And a birthday being celebrated  of Herod, [4danced 1the 2daughter  3of Herodias] in the midst, and she pleased  Herod.

7. Whereupon with an oath he acknowledged to give to her what ever she asked.

8. And she, being forced by  her mother -- Give to me, she says, here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist!

9. And [3fretted 1the 2king], but on account of the oaths, and the ones reclining together with him, he bid it to be given.

10. And having sent forth, he beheaded  John in the prison.

11. And  his head was brought upon a platter, and was given to the young woman. And she brought it to her mother.

12. And [2having come  1his disciples] carried the body, and buried it. And having come, they reported to Jesus. 

13.  Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand And [2having heard  1Jesus] withdrew from there in a boat unto a desolate place in private. And having heard, the multitudes followed him on foot from the cities.

14. And having come forth,  Jesus beheld a great multitude, and he was moved with compassion over them, and he cured  their ill ones.

15. And evening having become, there came forward to him  his disciples, saying, [3is desolate 1The 2place], and the hour already went by; dismiss the multitudes, that having gone forth into the towns they should buy foods for themselves!

16.  But Jesus said to them, No need do they have to go forth, you give to them yourselves something to eat!

17. And they say to him, We do not have anything here except for five bread loaves and two fishes.

18. And he said, Bring them to me here!

19. And having bid the multitudes to lie down upon the grass, and having taken the five bread loaves, and the two fishes, having looked up into the heaven, he blessed. And having broken, he gave to the disciples the bread loaves, and the disciples to the multitudes.

20. And all ate and were filled. And they lifted the abounding  pieces -- twelve hampers full.

21. And the ones having eaten were [3men 1about 2five thousand], apart from women and children.

22. And immediately [2compelled  1Jesus]  his disciples to step into the boat, and to lead before him unto the other side, until of which he should dismiss the multitudes.

23. And having dismissed the multitudes, he ascended into the mountain in private to pray. And evening being come, [3alone 1he was 2there].

24. And the boat [2already 3in the midst 4of the 5sea 1was], being tormented by the waves; [4was 1for 5adverse 2the 3wind].

25. And the fourth watch of the night [2went forth 3to 4them  1Jesus] walking upon the sea.

26. And [3seeing 4him 1the 2disciples 6upon 7the 8sea 5walking] were disturbed, saying that, It is a phantom! And from the fear they cried out.

27. And immediately [2spoke 3to them  1Jesus], saying, Courage! I am he, do not be fearful! 

28.  Peter Walks upon the Water And responding to him,  Peter said, O Lord, if you are he, bid me to come to you upon the waters!

29. And he said, Come! And [2descending 3from 4the 5boat  1Peter] walked upon the waters to go to  Jesus.

30. But seeing the [2wind 1strong], he feared. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, O Lord, save me!

31. And immediately  Jesus having stretched out the hand took hold of him, and says to him, O one of little belief, for why did you hesitate?

32. And of their stepping into the boat, [3abated 1the 2wind].

33. And the ones in the boat having come did obeisance to him, saying, Truly [3of God 2son 1you are].

34. And having passed through, they came unto the land of Gennesaret.

35. And having recognized him, the men  of that place sent into all  [2round about place 1that], and they brought to him all the ones [2illnesses 1having].

36. And they enjoined him that only they might touch the decorative hem  of his cloak. And as many as touched were delivered.  

## Matthew 15

1.  The Scribes and Pharisees Question Jesus Then came forward to Jesus the ones from Jerusalem -- scribes and Pharisees, saying,

2. Why do  your disciples violate the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash  their hands whenever [2bread 1they eat].

3. And he answering said to them, Why also do you violate the commandment  of God through  your tradition?

4.  For God gave charge, saying, Esteem the father and the mother! and, The one speaking evil of father or mother, by death shall come to an end.

5. But you say, Who ever should say to the father or to the mother, A gift offering is what ever [2from 3me 1you should derive benefit];

6. and in no way should esteem  his father or  his mother; and you voided the commandment  of God through  your tradition.

7. Hypocrites, well [2prophesied 3concerning 4you 1Isaiah], saying,

8. [2approach 3me  1This people] with their mouth, and with the lips esteem me,  but their heart is far off at a distance from me.

9. But in vain they worship me, teaching instructions -- precepts of men.

10. And having called on the multitude, he said to them, Hear and perceive!

11. Not the thing entering into the mouth defiles the man; but the thing going forth from out of the mouth, this defiles the man.

12. Then having drawn near,  his disciples said to him, Do you know that the Pharisees, the ones hearing the word, were offended?

13. And he answering said, Every plant which [4planted not  3father 1my  2heavenly] shall be rooted out.

14. Let them go! [3guides 1they are 2blind] of the blind. [3the blind 1And 5the blind 2if 4should guide], both [2into 3a cistern 1shall fall].

15. And responding  Peter said to him, Expound to us  this parable!

16.  And Jesus said, At this moment even [2you 3senseless 1are]?

17. Not yet do you comprehend, that all  entering into the mouth [2in 3the 4belly 1has a space], and into the bowel is cast out? 

18.  That Which Defiles a Man But the things going forth out of the mouth [2from 3the 4heart 1come forth], and those defile the man.

19. For from out of the heart come forth [2thoughts 1evil], murders, adulteries, harlotries, frauds, false witnesses, blasphemies.

20. These are the things defiling the man.  But [2with unwashed 3hands 1to eat] does not defile the man.

21. And [2having gone forth 3from there  1Jesus] withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. 

22.  The Canaanite Woman And behold, a Canaanite woman from  those borders coming forth cried out to him, saying, Show mercy on me, O Lord, O son of David;  my daughter is badly demon-possessed!

23. And he did not answer her a word. And [3having come  2disciples 1his] asked him, saying, Dismiss her! for she cries out behind us.

24. And responding he said, I was not sent except unto the [2sheep  1lost] of the house of Israel.

25. And she having come did obeisance to him, saying, O Lord, help me!

26. And he answering said, It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to throw it to the little dogs.

27. And she said, Yes O Lord, for even the little dogs eat from the crumbs  falling from the table  of their masters.

28. Then responding  Jesus said to her, O woman, great is [3of you 1the 2belief]; let it be to you as you want! And [2was healed  1her daughter] from  that hour.

29. And having crossed over from there,  Jesus came by the sea  of Galilee; and having ascended into the mountain, he was sitting there. 

30.  Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand And came forward to him [2multitudes 1great], having with themselves lame, blind, mutes, cripples, and [2others 1many]; and they dropped them by the feet  of Jesus; and he cured them.

31. So that the multitudes marveled seeing mutes speaking, cripples in health, lame walking, and blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.

32.  And Jesus having called on  his disciples, said, I am moved with compassion over the multitude, for already [2days 1three] they remain with me, and they have not anything to eat; and to dismiss them hungry from fasting I do not want, lest at any time they faint in the way.

33. And [2say 3to him  1his disciples], From where is there for us, being in desolation, bread loaves for so many, so as to fill a multitude so great?

34. And [2says 3to them  1Jesus], How many bread loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.

35. And he bid the multitudes to recline upon the ground.

36. And having taken the seven bread loaves, and the fishes, having given thanks he broke and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

37. And all ate and were filled. And they lifted up the abundance of the pieces -- seven baskets full.

38. And the ones eating were four thousand men, separate from women and children.

39. And having dismissed the multitudes, he stepped into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.  

## Matthew 16

1.  The Pharisees and Sadducees Test Jesus And having come forward, the Pharisees and Sadducees testing, asked him [2a sign 3from out of 4the 5heaven 1to display] to them.

2. And he answering said to them, Evening having become, you say, Fair weather; [4is fiery red 1for 2the 3heaven].

3. And at morning, Today it will be distressful; [5is fiery red 1for 4being gloomy 2the 3heaven]. Hypocrites, forasmuch as the face of the heaven you know to examine, but the signs of the times you are not able.

4. [3generation 1A wicked 2adulterous 5a sign 4seeks anxiously]; and a sign shall not be given it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. And leaving them behind, he went forth.

5. And [2having come  1his disciples] unto the other side forgot [2bread loaves 1to take].

6.  And Jesus said to them, See! and take heed from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!

7. And they were arguing among themselves, saying that, [2bread loaves 1We did not take].

8. And knowing,  Jesus said to them, Why are you arguing among yourselves, O ones of little belief, that [2bread loaves 1you did not take]?

9. Not yet do you comprehend, nor remember the five bread loaves of the five thousand, and how many hampers you took up?

10. Nor the seven bread loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?

11. How do you not comprehend that it is not concerning bread I spoke to you to take heed from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?

12. Then they perceived that he did not say to take heed of the yeast of the bread loaf, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 

13.  Jesus the Christ [3having come 1And  2Jesus] into the parts of Caesarea  of Philippi asked  his disciples, saying, Who [4me 1do 3say  2men 8to be 5the 6son  7of man]?

14. And they said, Some John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. He says to them, And you, who do you say me to be?

16. And answering Simon Peter said, You are the Christ, the son of the [2God  1living].

17. And responding  Jesus said to him, Blessed are you Simon Bar Jonah; for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but  my father, the one in the heavens.

18. And I say unto you, that you are Peter, and upon this, the rock, I will build my  assembly, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

19. And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatever you should have bound upon the earth, it shall be have been bound in the heavens; and what ever you should have untied upon the earth, it shall have been untied in the heavens.

20. Then he gave orders to his disciples that not one shall say that he is Jesus the Christ. 

21.  Jesus Foretells His Death From then Jesus began to show to his disciples that it is necessary for him to go forth unto Jerusalem, and [2much 1to suffer] from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and in the third day to be risen.

22. And [2taking him by himself  1Peter] began reproaching to him, saying, Kindness to you O Lord, in no way will [2be 3to you 1this].

23. And having turned he said to Peter, Get away behind me, Satan! [2my obstacle 1you are], for you do not think the things  of God, but the things  of men.

24. Then  Jesus said to his disciples, If any wants [2after 3me 1to come], let him totally reject himself, and lift  his cross, and follow me!

25. For who ever should want  [2his life 1to preserve], will lose it. But who ever should lose  his life because of me, shall find it.

26. For what benefits a man if the [2world 1entire] he should gain,  but his soul should suffer loss? Or what [2will 4give 3a man 1bargain]  for his soul?

27. [5is about 1For 2the 3son  4of man] to come in the glory  of his father with  his angels; and then he shall recompense each according to  his actions.

28. Amen I say to you, there are some of the ones here standing, the ones who in no way shall taste death, until whenever they should behold the son  of man coming in  his kingdom.  

## Matthew 17

1.  Jesus Transformed And after [2days 1six] Jesus takes with himself  Peter, and James, and John  his brother, and he bears them unto [2mountain 1a high] in private.

2. And he transformed in front of them, and [2radiated  1his face] as the sun. And the garments of his became white as the light.

3. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah with him, conversing together.

4. And responding  Peter said to Jesus, O Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you want, we shall make here three tents; to you one, and to Moses one, and one to Elijah.

5. Yet of his speaking, behold, a cloud giving light overshadowed them, and behold, there was a voice from out of the cloud saying, This is  my son the beloved, in whom I take pleasure in; hearken to him!

6. And [3hearing 1the 2disciples] fell upon their face, and they were fearful exceedingly.

7. And coming forward,  Jesus touched them, and said, Arise, and be not fearful!

8. And having lifted up  their eyes, [2no one 1they beheld] except  Jesus only.

9. And in their going down from the mountain, [2gave charge 3to them  1Jesus], saying, Not to one should you tell the vision, until of which time the son  of man [2from 3the dead 1should rise up].

10. And [2asked 3him  1his disciples], saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

11.  And Jesus answering said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and shall restore all things.

12. And I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him as much as they wanted. So also the son  of man is about to suffer by them.

13. Then [3perceived 1the 2disciples] that concerning John the Baptist he spoke to them. 

14.  Jesus Cures the Lunatic Boy And of their coming to the multitude, there came forward to him a man kneeling to him, and saying,

15. O Lord, show mercy on my  son, for he acts lunatic, and [2badly 1he suffers]. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to cure him.

17. And responding  Jesus said, O [4generation 1unbelieving 2and 3perverted], until when shall I be with you? Until when shall I endure you? Bring him to me here!

18. And [2reproached 3him  1Jesus], and came forth from him the demon. And [3was cured 1the 2child] from  that hour. 

19.  Mustard Seed Belief Then [3having come forward 1the 2disciples] to Jesus in private, said, Why were we not able to cast it out?

20.  And Jesus said to them, Because of  your unbelief. For amen I say to you, if you have belief as a kernel of mustard, you shall say to this mountain, Be crossed over from here to there, even it will cross over; and nothing shall be impossible to you.

21. But this  kind does not go forth except by prayer and fasting.

22. [3returning 1And 2of their] to  Galilee, [2said 3to them  1Jesus], [4is about 1The 2son  3of man] to be delivered up into the hands of men;

23. and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised up. And they fretted exceedingly. 

24.  The Coin in the Fish [3having come 1And 2of their] into Capernaum, came forward the ones [2the 3double-drachmas 1receiving] to Peter, and said,  Your teacher, does he not fulfill the double-drachmas?

25. He says, Yes. And when he entered into the house, [2anticipated 3him  1Jesus], saying, What do you assume, Simon? The kings of the earth -- from whom do they receive taxes or tribute, from  their sons or from the strangers?

26. [2says 3to him  1Peter], From the strangers. [2said 3to him  1Jesus], It is so, [4indeed 5free 3are 1the 2sons].

27. But that we should not stumble them, having gone to the sea, throw a hook! and the [3ascending 1first 2fish] take! And having opened  its mouth, you will find a stater; that having taken, give it to them for me and you!  

## Matthew 18

1.  The Greatest in the Kingdom In that  hour [3came forward 1the 2disciples] to Jesus, saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of the heavens?

2. And Jesus having called a child, stood it in the midst of them.

3. And he said, Amen I say to you, If you should not turn and become as the children, in no way should you enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

4. Whoever then humbles himself as  this child, this one is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens.

5. And who ever receives [3child 2such 1one] in  my name, receives me.

6. And who ever should cause to stumble one  of these small ones  trusting in me, it would be advantageous to him that [3should be hung 1a millstone 2of a donkey] upon  his neck, and he should be sunk in the open  sea.

7. Woe to the world because of the obstacles; [3a necessity 1for 2it is 6to come 4for the 5obstacles]. Except woe to that man through whom the obstacle comes.

8. And if  your hand or  your foot causes you to stumble, cut them off, and throw them from you! [2good 3for you 1It is] to enter into  life lame or crippled, than [2two 3hands 4or 5two 6feet 1having] to be thrown into the [2fire  1eternal].

9. And if  your eye stumbles you, take it out and cast it from you! [2good 3for you 1It is 5one-eyed 6in  7life 4to enter], than [2two 3eyes 1having] to be thrown into the Gehenna  of fire.

10. See that you should not disdain one  of these small ones! For I say to you, that  their angels in the heavens continually look on the face  of my father, the one in the heavens. 

11.  The Lost Sheep [5is come 1For 2the 3son  4of man] to save the lost.

12. What do you think? If there should be to any man a hundred sheep, and [2should wander 1one] from them, shall he not leave the ninety nine upon the mountains, and having gone seek the one wandering?

13. And if it happens he finds it, amen I say to you, that he rejoices over it, rather than over the ninety nine  not wandering.

14. Thus it is not the will before  your father, the one in the heavens, that [3should be lost 1one  2of these small ones]. 

15.  When a Brother Sins But if [3should sin 4against 5you  2brother 1your], go and reprove him between you and him alone! If he should hear you, you gain  your brother.

16. And if he should not hear, take with you still one or two, that by the mouth of two witnesses or three [3shall be established 1every 2matter]!

17. But if he should disregard them, speak to the assembly! And if also the assembly he should disregard, let him be to you as if  a heathen and  tax collector!

18. Amen I say to you, as much as you should tie upon the earth, it will be tied in the heaven; and as much as you should untie upon the earth, it will be untied in the heaven.

19. Again amen I say to you, that if two of you should join in harmony upon the earth concerning every matter of which ever they should ask, it shall happen to them by  my father, the one in the heavens.

20. For where there are two or three being gathered together in  my name, there I am in the midst of them.

21. Then having come forward to him,  Peter said, O Lord, how often shall [2sin 3against 4me  1my brother] and I forgive him -- until seven times?

22. [2says 3to him  1Jesus], Not I say to you unto seven times, but unto seventy times seven.

23. On account of this likened is the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a king, who wants to take up a reckoning with  his manservants.

24. [3having begun 1And 2he] to take up the matter, brings near to him one debtor of ten thousand talents.

25. [3not 4having 1But 2he] means to give back, [2bids 3him  1his master] to be sold, and  his wife, and the children, and all as much as he had, and to render back.

26. [4falling 1Then 2the 3manservant], did obeisance to him, saying, O Lord, be lenient upon me! and [2all 3to you 1I will give back].

27. [4being moved with compassion on 1And 2the 3master]  that manservant, released him, and [3the 4debt 1forgave 2to him].

28. And going forth  that manservant found one  of his fellow-servants, who owed to him a hundred denarii, and having held him, choked him saying, Give back to me if anything you owe!

29. [3falling 1Then  2his fellow-servant] at  his feet enjoined him, saying, Be lenient upon me, and I will give back to you!

30. But he did not want to, but going forth he cast him into prison, until he should give back the thing being owed.

31. [3knowing 1And  2his fellow-servants] the things happening, fretted exceedingly. And having gone they made clear to their master all the things happening.

32. Then [2having called 3him  1his master], says to him, [2manservant 1O wicked], all  that debt I canceled to you, when you enjoined me;

33. [3not 1must 4also 2you] show mercy  on your fellow-servant as also I showed mercy on you?

34. And being provoked to anger,  his master delivered him to the tormenters, until of which time he should give back all  being owed to him.

35. So also  [3father 1my  2heavenly] shall do to you if [2forgives not 1each]  his brother from  your hearts  of their transgressions.  

## Matthew 19

1.  Jesus Teaches Concerning Divorce And it came to pass when Jesus finished  these words, he moved from  Galilee, and he came unto the borders  of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.

2. And [3followed 4him 2multitudes 1great]; and he cured them there.

3. And [3came forward 4to him 1the 2Pharisees] testing him, and saying to him, Is it allowed to a man to dismiss  his wife for every reason?

4. And he answering said to them, Did you not read that the one making from the beginning, [3male 4and 5female 1made 2them].

5. And he said, On account of this [2shall leave 1a man] the father and the mother, and shall cleave to  his wife, and [3will be 1the 2two] for [2flesh 1one].

6. So that no longer are they two, but [2flesh 1one]. What then  God yoked together, let not man separate!

7. They say to him, Why then did Moses give charge to give a scroll of divorce, and to dismiss her?

8. He says to them that, Moses for the hardness of your heart committed to your care to dismiss  your wives; [2from 3the beginning 1but] it happened not thus.

9. And I say to you, that who ever should dismiss  his wife, not for harlotry, and should marry another, commits adultery; and the one being dismissed marrying, commits adultery.

10. [2say 3to him  1His disciples], If thus is the fault of the man with the wife, it is not advantageous to marry.

11. And he said to them, Not all have space  for this word, but to the ones whom it has been given.

12. For there are eunuchs, the ones who from [2belly 1the mother's] were procreated thus; and there are eunuchs, the ones who were made eunuchs by  men; and there are eunuchs, the ones who made eunuchs of themselves on account of the kingdom of the heavens. The one being able to have space, let him have space! 

13.  Jesus Prays for the Children Then they brought to him children that [2the 3hands 1he should place] upon them, and should pray for them; but the disciples reproached them.

14.  And Jesus said, Allow the children, and do not restrain them to come to me!  for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.

15. And having placed [3upon 4them 1the 2hands], he went from there. 

16.  The Rich Young Man And behold, one having come forward said to him, [2teacher 1Good], what good thing shall I do, that I should have life eternal?

17.  And he said to him, Why do you call me good? no one is good except one --  God. But if you want to enter into the life, keep the commandments!

18. He says to him, Which?  And Jesus said, The one -- you shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not witness falsely;

19. esteem  your father and  your mother; and, you shall love  your neighbor as yourself.

20. [3says 4to him 1The 2young man], All these I kept from my youth; what still do I lack?

21. [2said 3to him  1Jesus], If you want to be perfect, go away and sell your  possessions, and give to poor ones! and you shall have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me!

22. [4having heard 1And 2the 3young man] the word went forth fretting; for he was holding [2possessions 1many].

23.  And Jesus said to his disciples, Amen I say to you that, with difficulty a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

24. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel [2through 3the hole 4made by an awl 1to go], than a rich man [2into 3the 4kingdom  5of God 1to enter].

25. And having heard,  his disciples were overwhelmed exceedingly, saying, Who then is able to be delivered?

26. And looking,  Jesus said to them, By men this is impossible, but by God all things are possible.

27. Then responding  Peter said to him, Behold, we left all, and followed you; what then will be to us?

28.  And Jesus said to them, Amen I say to you, that you, the ones following me, in the regeneration, whenever [4should be seated 1the 2son  3of man] upon the throne of his glory, [2shall sit 3also 1you] upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes  of Israel.

29. And every one who left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, because of  my name, [2a hundred-fold 1shall receive], and [3life 2eternal 1shall inherit].

30. But many first will be last, and last first.  

## Matthew 20

1.  The Parable of the Vineyard [7likened 1For 6is 2the 3kingdom 4of the 5heavens] to a man, a master of a house, who came forth at the same time in the morning to hire workers for  his vineyard.

2. And having agreed with the workers for a denarius  a day, he sent them into  his vineyard.

3. And having come forth around the third hour, he beheld others standing in the market idle.

4. And to those he said, You go also yourselves into the vineyard! and what ever might be just I will give to you.

5. And they went forth. Again going forth around the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.

6. And around the eleventh hour, having come forth, he found others standing idle, and he says to them, Why [2here 1do you stand] the entire  day idle?

7. They say to him that, No one hired us. He says to them, You go also yourselves into the vineyard, and what ever might be just you shall receive!

8. And evening having become, says the master of the vineyard to his caretaker, Call the workers, and render to them the wage! beginning from the last unto the first.

9. And the ones having come around the eleventh hour, received each a denarius.

10. And having come, the first ones thought that [2more 1they shall receive]; and they received also themselves each a denarius.

11. And having received, they grumbled against the master of the house,

12. saying that, These  last [2for only one 3hour 1produced], and [2equal 3to us 1you made them], the ones bearing the load of the day and the burning wind.

13. And he responding said to one of them, My companion, [3not 1I wrong 2you]; [2not 5for a denarius 1did you 3agree 4with me]?

14. Carry  yours and go! But I want [2to these  3last ones 1to give] as also to you.

15. Or is it not allowed to me to do what I want in the things mine? Is it  your eye is wicked, that I am good?

16. Thus will be the last first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.

17. And [2ascending  1Jesus] unto Jerusalem, took with himself the twelve disciples in private on the way, and he said to them;

18. Behold, we ascend unto Jerusalem, and the son  of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests, and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.

19. And they shall deliver him up to the nations, to  mock and to whip and to crucify; and in the third day he shall rise up. 

20.  The Mother of the Sons of Zebedee Then came forward to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with  her sons doing obeisance, and asking something from him.

21. And he said to her, What do you want? She says to him, Say that [5should sit 1these  3two 4sons 2my], one on your right, and one on your left, in  your kingdom!

22. And answering Jesus said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? And the immersion which I am immersed to be immersed? They say to him, We are able.

23. And he says to them,  Indeed, my cup you shall drink, and the immersion which I am immersed you shall be immersed;  but to sit on my right and on my left is not mine to give, but to the ones whom it has been prepared by  my father.

24. And having heard, the ten were indignant about the two brothers.

25.  And Jesus having called them, said, You know that the rulers of the nations dominate them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.

26. [2not 3so 1But] shall it be with you. But who ever should want among you [2great 1to become], shall be your servant.

27. And who ever should want among you to be first, shall be your servant.

28. As the son  of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give  his life as a ransom instead of many.

29. And of their going forth from Jericho, there followed to him [multitude 1a great].

30. And behold, two blind men sitting down by the way, having heard that Jesus is passing by, cried out, saying, Show mercy on us, O Lord, son of David!

31. But the multitude reproached them that they should keep silent. But all the greater they cried out, saying, Show mercy on us, O Lord, son of David!

32. And standing,  Jesus called them, and said, What do you want I should do to you?

33. They say to him, O Lord, that [3should be open 1our  2eyes].

34. And moved with compassion,  Jesus touched  their eyes. And immediately [3gained sight 1their  2eyes], and they followed him.  

## Matthew 21

1.  Jesus Enters Jerusalem And when they approached unto Jerusalem, and came into Bethphage, to the mount  of olives, then  Jesus sent two disciples,

2. saying to them, Go into the town, the one before you! And immediately you shall find a donkey being tied, and a foal with her; having untied lead them to me!

3. And if anyone should say to you anything, you say that,  Their master [2need 1has]; and immediately he sends them.

4. And this entirely came to pass, that should be fulfilled the thing having been spoken through the prophet, saying,

5. Say to the daughter of Zion! Behold,  your king comes to you, gentle, and being mounted upon a donkey, and a foal, an offspring of a beast of burden.

6. [4having gone 1And 2the 3disciples], and having done as [2assigned 3to them  1Jesus],

7. they led the donkey and the foal, and they placed upon them  their cloaks, and he sat upon them.

8. And the greatest part of the multitude spread out their own  cloaks in the way; and others beat branches from the trees, and spread them out in the way.

9. And the multitudes, the ones leading before and the ones following, cried out, saying, Hosanna to the son of David. Being blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord; hosanna in the highest.

10. And in his entering into Jerusalem, [4was shaken 1all 2the 3city], saying, Who is this?

11. And the multitudes said, This is Jesus the prophet, the one from Nazareth  of Galilee. 

12.  Jesus Cleanses the Temple And Jesus entered into the temple  of God, and he cast out all the ones selling and buying in the temple; and the tables of the money-changers he overturned, and the chairs of the ones selling the doves.

13. And he says to them, It is written,  My house [2a house 3of prayer 1shall be called]; but you made it a cave of robbers.

14. And came forward to him the lame and blind in the temple; and he cured them.

15. [7beholding 1And 2the 3chief priests 4and 5the 6scribes] the wonders which he did, and the children crying out in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were indignant.

16. And they said to him, Do you hear what these say?  And Jesus says to them, Yes, at no time did you read that, From out of the mouth of infants and nursing ones I readied praise?

17. And leaving them, he came forth outside the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.

18. And in the morning turning back into the city, he hungered. 

19.  Jesus Dries Up the Fig-tree And beholding [2fig-tree 1one] upon the way, he came unto it and [2nothing 1found] on it except leaves only. And he says to it, No longer from you [2fruit 1should] be produced into the eon. And 4dried up 1immediately 2the 3fig-tree].

20. And beholding, the disciples marveled, saying, How did [3immediately 4dry up 1the 2fig-tree]?

21. And answering  Jesus said to them, Amen I say to you, If you should have belief, and should not examine, not only the thing of the fig-tree shall you do, but even if to this mountain you should say, Be lifted and be thrown into the sea! it shall come to pass.

22. And all as much as you should have asked in the prayer, believing, you shall receive. 

23.  Jesus' Authority Questioned And in his coming into the temple, came forward to him while teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people, saying, By what authority do you do these things, and who gave to you  this authority?

24. And answering  Jesus said to them, I shall ask you also [2word 1one], which if you should tell to me, I also will tell to you by what authority I do these things.

25. The immersion of John, from what place was it? From heaven or from men? And they argued by themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?

26. And if we should say, From men; we fear the multitude. For all hold  John as a prophet.

27. And answering to Jesus they said, We do not know. He said to them also himself, Nor I tell to you by what authority I do these things. 

28.  The Parable of the Two Sons But what do you think? A certain man had [2children 1two]. And having come forward to the first, he said, Child, go! today work in  my vineyard!

29.  And responding he said, I do not want to. But afterwards, having changed his mind he went forth.

30. And having come forward to the second, he said likewise. And he answering said, I will, O master. and he did not go forth.

31. Which of the two did the will of the father? They say to him, The first. [2says 3to them  1Jesus], Amen I say to you, that, The tax collectors and the harlots go before you into the kingdom  of God.

32. [3came 1For 4to 5you 2John] in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. But you having seen did not repent afterwards  to believe him. 

33.  The Parable of the Growers Another parable hear! A certain man was master of a house, who planted a vineyard, and [2a barrier 3for it 1he put around], and he dug in it a wine vat, and built a tower, and handed it over to growers, and he traveled abroad.

34. And when [5approached 1the 2season 3of the 4fruits], he sent  his servants to the growers to receive  of his fruits.

35. And [3having taken 1the 2growers]  his servants, one they flayed, and one they killed, and one they stoned.

36. Again he sent other servants more than the first; and they did to them likewise.

37. And afterwards he sent to them  his son, saying, They will respect  my son.

38. And the growers seeing the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, we should kill him, and take control  of his inheritance.

39. And having taken, they cast him outside the vineyard, and killed him.

40. Whenever then [5shall come 1the 2master 3of the 4vineyard], what shall he do  to those growers?

41. They say to him, The evil men, harshly he will destroy them, and the vineyard he will hand over to other growers, the ones who will render to him the fruits in  their seasons.

42. [2says 3to them  1Jesus], At no time did you read in the scriptures? The stone which [3rejected 1the ones 2building], this one became as head corner stone; by the Lord this happened, and it is wonderful in our eyes.

43. On account of this I say to you, that, [4shall be lifted away 5from 6you 1The 2kingdom  3of God], and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.

44. And the one falling upon  this stone shall be fractured in pieces; [2upon 3whom 1but] ever it should fall it shall winnow him.

45. And [6hearing 1the 2chief priests 3and 4the 5Pharisees]  his parables, knew that about them he speaks.

46. And seeking to hold him, they feared the multitudes, since [2as 3a prophet 1they held him].  

## Matthew 22

1.  The Parable of the Wedding Feast And responding  Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying,

2. [5was likened 1The 2kingdom 3of the 4heavens] to a man, a king, who prepared wedding feasts  for his son.

3. And he sent  his servants to call the ones being invited unto the wedding feasts; and they did not want to come.

4. Again he sent other servants, saying, Say to the ones being invited! Behold,  my dinner is prepared;  my bullocks and the fattened calves are being sacrificed, and all things are prepared; come to the wedding feasts.

5.  But neglecting, they went forth, the one unto  his own field, and one unto  his trade;

6. and the remaining having taken hold  of his servants, insulted and killed them.

7. And having heard,  that king was provoked to anger. And having sent forth  his military, he destroyed  those murderers, and  their city he burned.

8. Then he says to his servants, Indeed the wedding feast is prepared, but the ones being invited were not worthy.

9. You go then unto the outer reaches of the ways! and as many as you should find, invite to the wedding feasts!

10. And [2having gone forth  1those servants] into the ways, gathered together all, as many as they found, both wicked and good; and [3was filled 1the 2wedding feast] with ones reclining.

11. [4entering 1And 2the 3king] to see the ones reclining, beheld there a man not having put on [2garment 1the wedding].

12. And he says to him, Friend, how did you enter here not having [2garment 1a wedding]? And he was halted.

13. Then [3said 1the 2king] to the servants, Having bound his feet and hands, lift him and cast him into the [2darkness  1outer]! There, there will be the weeping and the gnashing  of teeth.

14. For many are called, but few are chosen. 

15.  Jesus Questioned Regarding Taxes Then having gone, the Pharisees [2council 1took] how they should ensnare him in a matter.

16. And they sent to him  their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true, and the way  of God in truth you teach, and there is no care to you concerning any one, [3not 1for 2you see] to the person of men.

17. Now then tell to us! What do you think? Is it allowed to give tribute to Caesar or not?

18. [3knowing 1And  2Jesus]  their wickedness, said, Why do you test me, hypocrites?

19. Display to me the money for the tribute! And they brought to him a denarius.

20. And he says to them, What is the image to this and the inscription?

21. They say to him, Caesar's. Then he says to them, Render then the things of Caesar, to Caesar, and the things  of God, to God!

22. And having heard they marveled, and leaving him, they went forth. 

23.  Jesus Questioned Regarding the Resurrection On that  day, [2came forward 3to him 1Sadducees], the ones saying there is no resurrection. And they asked him,

24. saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any should die not having children, [2shall ally by marriage  1his brother] to his wife, and shall raise up seed to his brother.

25. Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first having married came to an end; and not having seed he left  his wife to his brother.

26. In like manner also the second, and the third, unto the seven.

27. And afterwards all died and the woman.

28. In the then resurrection, which of the seven will she be wife? for all had her.

29. And answering  Jesus said to them, You err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power  of God.

30. For in the resurrection neither they marry, nor give in marriage, but [2as 3angels  4of God 5in 6heaven 1they are].

31. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, Did you not read the thing having been spoken to you by  God, saying,

32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of living.

33. And having heard, the multitudes were overwhelmed at  his teaching. 

34.  The Great Commandment And the Pharisees, having heard that he halted the Sadducees, gathered together at the same place.

35. And [4asked 1one 2of 3them], a legal expert, testing him and saying,

36. Teacher, which commandment is great in the law?

37.  And Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord  your God with [2entire  3heart 1your], and with [2entire  3soul 1your], and with [2entire  3thought 1your].

38. This is the first and great commandment.

39. And second likened to it, You shall love  your neighbor as yourself.

40. In these the two commandments all the law and the prophets hang upon.

41. [4being gathered together 1And 2the 3Pharisees], [2asked 3them  1Jesus],

42. saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is he? They say to him,  David's.

43. He says to them, How then does David in spirit [2him Lord 1call]? Saying,

44. [3said 1The 2Lord] to my Lord, Sit down at my right until whenever I should establish  your enemies for a footstool  for your feet!

45. If then David called him, Lord, how [2son 1is he his]?

46. And no one was able to answer him a word; nor dared [3anything 4from 5that  6day 1to ask 2him] any more.  

## Matthew 23

1.  Hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees Then  Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,

2. saying, Upon the chair of Moses sat the scribes and the Pharisees.

3. All then, as much as they should say to you to give heed, you give heed and do! But according to  their works do not do! for they speak and do not do.

4. For they bind [2load 1a heavy] and ones hard to bear, and place them upon the shoulders  of men;  but with their finger they do not want to move them.

5. And all  their works they do to  be a spectacle to the men. And they widen  their phylacteries, and magnify the decorative hems  of their cloaks;

6. and are fond of  first place in the suppers, and the first seats in the synagogues,

7. and the greetings in the markets, and to be called by the men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

8. But you should not be called, Rabbi; for one is your  mentor, the Christ, and all you are brethren.

9. And [6father 1call not 2any of yours 3upon 4the 5earth]; [3one 1for 2there is] --  your father, the one in the heavens.

10. Nor be called mentors; for one is your  mentor -- the Christ.

11. And the greater of you will be your servant.

12. And whoever shall exalt himself, shall be humbled; and whoever shall humble himself, shall be exalted. 

13.  Woe to the Scribes and Pharisees Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you devour the houses of the widows, and as an excuse [2long 1praying]; on account of this you shall receive more extra judgment.

14. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you lock the kingdom of the heavens before  men; for you do not enter in, nor the ones entering do you allow to enter.

15. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you lead about the sea and the dry land, to make one convert, and whenever he becomes so, you make him a son of Gehenna -- more double than yourselves.

16. Woe to you [2guides 1blind], the ones saying, Who ever should swear by an oath on the temple, it is nothing; but who ever should swear by an oath on the gold of the temple, he owes.

17. Morons and blind; for what is greater, the gold, or the temple  sanctifying the gold?

18. And saying, Who ever should swear by an oath on the altar, it is nothing; but who ever should swear by an oath by the gift offering  upon it, he owes.

19. Morons and blind; for which is greater, the gift offering, or the altar  sanctifying the gift offering?

20. The one then swearing an oath by the altar, swears an oath by it, and by all the things upon it.

21. And the one swearing an oath by the temple, swears an oath by it, and by the one dwelling in it.

22. And the one swearing an oath by the heaven, swears an oath by the throne  of God, and by the one sitting down upon it.

23. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for you tithe the mint, and the dill, and the cummin, and leave the heavier matters of the law -- the judgment, and the mercy, and the belief -- these necessary to do, and these are not allowed.

24. [2guides 1Blind], the ones straining the gnat,  but [2a camel 1swallowing down].

25. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside is full of seizure and intemperance.

26. Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the thing within the cup and the dish, that [2should also become  1their outside] clean.

27. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for you are like tombs being whitewashed, ones which outside indeed appear beautiful, but inside are full of bones of the dead and of all uncleanness.

28. So also you from outside indeed appear  to men as righteous, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and of lawlessness.

29. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the memorials of the righteous ones,

30. and you say, If we were in the days  of our fathers, [2would not be 1we] their partners in the blood of the prophets.

31. So that you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of the ones murdering the prophets.

32. And you, you fill up the measure  of your fathers.

33. Serpents, offspring of vipers, how should you flee from the judgment  of Gehenna?

34. On account of this, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes; and of them you shall kill and crucify, and of them you will whip in  your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city;

35. so that should come upon you all [2blood 1righteous] having been poured out upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous, unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.

36. Amen I say to you that [3shall come 1all 2these things] upon  this generation. 

37.  Jesus Laments Over Jerusalem Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets, and stoning the ones sent to her. How often I wanted to assemble  your children in which manner [2assembles 1a hen]  her nestlings under the wings, and you wanted not.

38. Behold, [2is left 3to you  1your house] desolate.

39. For I say to you, In no way should you behold me from now, until whenever you should say, Being blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord.  

## Matthew 24

1.  Signs of the End And coming forth,  Jesus went from the temple. And [2came forward  1his disciples] to display to him the constructions of the temple.

2.  And Jesus said to them, Do you see all these things? Amen I say to you, In no way shall there be left here a stone upon a stone, which in any way shall be resting.

3. [3sitting down 1And in 2his] upon the mount  of olives, there came forward to him the disciples in private, saying, Tell us when these things will be, and what is the sign  of your arrival, and the completion of the age?

4. And answering  Jesus said to them, Take heed lest any should mislead you!

5. For many shall come in  my name, saying, I am the Christ. And [2many 1they shall mislead].

6. But you shall be about to hear of wars and reports of wars. Look to it! lest you be alarmed, [3must 1for 2all these things] take place, but not yet is the end.

7. [3shall rise up 1For 2nation] against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, and pestilent things, and earthquakes in places.

8. And all these things are the beginning of birth-pangs.

9. Then they shall deliver you unto affliction, and shall kill you; and you shall be ones being detested by all the nations on account of  my name.

10. And then [2shall be stumbled 1many], and [2one another 1they shall deliver up], and they shall detest one another.

11. And many false prophets shall arise, and they shall mislead many.

12. And on account of the multiplying the lawlessness, [4shall be made cold 1the 2love  3of many].

13. But the one remaining unto the end, this one shall be delivered.

14. And [5shall be proclaimed 1this  2good news 3of the 4kingdom] in the entire  inhabitable world, for a testimony to all the ones among the nations; and then shall come the end. 

15.  The Abomination of the Desolation Whenever then you should behold the abomination of the desolation, the thing having been spoken through Daniel the prophet, standing in [2place 1a holy]; (the one reading let him comprehend!)

16. Then the ones in  Judea, let them flee unto the mountains!

17. The one upon the roof, let him not go down to lift anything from out of  his house.

18. And the one in the field, let him not turn back to carry  his garments.

19. But woe to the ones [2one in 3the womb 1having], and the ones nursing in those  days.

20. And pray that [2should not take place  1your flight into exile] in winter, nor on the Sabbath.

21. For there will be then [2affliction 1great], such as has not taken place from the beginning of the world until the present, nor in any way to be.

22. And unless [2were cut short  1those days], not even was [3delivered 1any 2flesh]. But on account of the chosen ones [2shall be cut short  1those days].

23. Then if any should say to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or here; you should not believe.

24. For shall arise false christs and false prophets, and they will give [2signs 1great] and miracles, so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.

25. Behold, I described to you beforehand.

26. If then they should say to you, Behold, [2in 3the 4wilderness 1he is]; you should not go forth. or, Behold, he is in the inner chambers; you should not believe it.

27. For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and shines forth unto the west, so will be also the arrival of the son  of man.

28. For where ever might be the corpse, there [3will be gathered together 1the 2eagles].

29. And immediately after the affliction  of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give  its brightness, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the forces of the heavens shall be shaken. 

30.  The Coming of the Son of Man And then shall appear the sign of the son  of man in the heaven. And then [6shall beat their chest 1all 2the 3tribes 4of the 5earth]. And they shall see the son  of man coming upon the clouds of the heaven with power and [2glory 1great].

31. And he shall send  his angels with a trumpet [2sound 1of great]. And they shall assemble  his chosen from out of the four winds, from the tips of the heavens unto their tips.

32. But from the fig-tree learn the parable! Whenever already  its branches become tender, and the leaves spring forth, know that [2is near  1summer].

33. So also you, whenever you behold all these things, know that it is near at the doors.

34. Amen I say to you, In no way should [2pass away  1this generation] until whenever all these things should come to pass.

35. The heaven and the earth shall pass away,  but my words in no way shall pass away.

36. But concerning  that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens, only  my father alone.

37. And as the days  of Noah, so will be also the arrival of the son  of man.

38. For as were in the days, the ones before the flood, gnawing and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, as far as of which day Noah entered into the ark,

39. and they did not know, until [3came 1the 2flood] and lifted all. So it will be also in the arrival of the son  of man.

40. Then two will be in the field; the one shall be taken by himself, and the one left.

41. Two women grinding at the mill; one shall be taken by herself, and one left.

42. Be vigilant then, for you know not what hour  your Lord comes! 

43.  Be Prepared But this know! that if [3knew 1the 2master of the house] what watch the thief comes, he would have been vigilant, and he would not have allowed [2to be dug through  1his house].

44. On account of this you also be prepared! for in which hour you think not, the son  of man comes.

45. Who then is the trustworthy [3manservant 1and 2practical] whom [2placed  1his master] over  his service,  to give to them  provision in season?

46. Blessed is  that servant whom [2having come  1his master] shall find doing thus.

47. Amen I say to you that, Over all  his possessions he shall place him.

48. But if [4should say  2evil 3servant 1that] in  his heart, [2passes time  1My master] to come;

49. and he should begin to beat the fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the ones being intoxicated;

50. [4shall come 1the 2master  3of that servant] in a day in which he does not expect, and in an hour in which he knows not.

51. And he shall cut him in pieces, and  his portion [2with 3the 4hypocrites 1will be established]. There, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.  

## Matthew 25

1.  The Parable of the Ten Virgins Then shall be likened the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins, the ones who having taken  their lamps went forth to meet the groom.

2. And five [3were 1of 1them] practical, and the five moronish.

3. The ones who were moronish, having taken  their lamps, did not take [2with 3themselves 1oil].

4. But the practical took oil in  their receptacles with  their lamps.

5. [4passing time 1But 2the 3groom], they all slumbered and slept.

6. And in the middle of the night a cry came, Behold, the groom comes, go forth to meet him!

7. Then arose all  those virgins, and they trimmed  their lamps.

8. And the moronish [2to the 3practical 1said], Give to us from  your oil! for  our lamps are extinguishing.

9. [4answered 1And 2the 3practical], saying, No, lest at any time it should not be sufficient to us and to you; but you go rather to the ones selling, and buy for yourselves.

10. [3going forth 1And 2of their] to buy, [3came 1the 2groom]; and the ones prepared entered with him unto the wedding feasts; and [3was locked 1the 2door].

11. And afterwards came also the remaining virgins, saying, O Master, O Master, open to us!

12. And he answering said, Amen I say to you, I do not know you.

13. Be vigilant then! for you know not the day nor the hour in which the son  of man comes. 

14.  The Parable of the Talents For as a man traveling abroad called  his own servants, and delivered up to them  his possessions.

15. And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and he traveled abroad immediately.

16. And having gone, the one [2the 3five 4talents 1receiving] worked with them, and made another five talents.

17. Likewise also the one receiving the two, he gained himself also another two.

18. And the [2the 3one 1one receiving], having gone forth dug in the ground, and concealed the money  of his master.

19. And after [2time 1a long] came the master  of those servants. And he takes up a reckoning with them.

20. And having come forward the one [2the 3five 4talents 1receiving], brought another five talents, saying, O Master, five talents to me you delivered; see, another five talents I gained besides them!

21. [3said 1And 4to him  2his master], Well done, O [4servant 1good 2and 3trustworthy], over a few things you were trustworthy, over many I will place you; enter into the joy  of your master!

22. And coming forward also the one [2the 3two 4talents 1receiving], said, O Master, two talents you delivered up to me; see, another two talents I gained besides them!

23. [2said 3to him  1And his master], Well done, O [4servant 1good 2and 3trustworthy], over a few things you were trustworthy, over many I will place you; enter into the joy  of your master!

24. And having come forward also the one [2the 3one 4talent 1having taken], said, O Master, I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you sowed not, and gathering from where you dispersed not.

25. And fearing, having gone forth, I hid  your talent in the ground; see, you have  yours!

26. And responding  his master said to him, O Wicked [3servant 1and 2lazy], you knew that I harvest where I sowed not, and gather from where I dispersed not.

27. It was necessary then for you to put  my money with the bankers; and coming I be delivered whatever  was mine with interest.

28. Take then from him the talent, and give it to the one having the ten talents!

29.  For to every one having shall be given, and shall abound; but from the one not having, even what he has shall be taken from him.

30. And [2the 3useless 4servant 1cast out] into  [2darkness  1outer]! There, there will be the weeping and  gnashing of the teeth.

31. And whenever comes the son  of man in  his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory. 

32.  The Sheep Separated from the Goats And he shall gather together before him all the nations, and he will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the kids of the goats.

33. And he will set the [2indeed 1sheep] on his right, and the little kids on his left.

34. Then [3shall say 1the 2king] to the ones on his right, Come, O ones being blessed  of my father, inherit the [2being prepared 3for you 1kingdom] from the founding of the world!

35. For I hungered, and you gave me to eat; I thirsted, and you gave me a drink; I was a stranger, and you brought me in;

36. naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; [2in 3prison 1I was], and you came to me.

37. Then [3will answer 4to him 1the 2righteous], saying, O Master, when did we see you hungering, and we nourished you; or thirsting, and we gave you a drink?

38. And when did we behold you a stranger, and brought you in? or naked, and we clothed you?

39. And when did we behold you sick or in prison, and we came to you?

40. And answering the king shall say to them, Amen I say to you, in as much as you did to one of these  [3of my brethren 1the 2least] you did to me.

41. Then he will say also to the ones on his left, Go from me! O ones being cursed into the [2fire  1eternal], the one having been prepared for the devil and  his angels.

42. For I hungered, and you did not give to me to eat; I thirsted, and you did not give me a drink;

43. I was a stranger, and you did not bring me in; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.

44. Then [2will answer 3to him 1they also], saying, O Master, when did we behold you hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and we did not serve to you?

45. Then he will answer to them, saying, Amen I say to you, if as much as you did not do to one [3of these 1of the 2least], not even to me did you do.

46. And these shall go forth unto [2punishment 1eternal]; but the righteous unto life eternal.  

## Matthew 26

1.  Jesus Foretells of His Death And it came to pass when Jesus finished all  these words, he said to his disciples,

2. You know that after two days the passover takes place, and the son  of man is delivered up for the crucifying.

3. Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people in the courtyard of the chief priest, of the one being called Caiaphas.

4. And they were advising that  they should seize Jesus by treachery, and should kill him.

5. But they said, Not during the holiday, that [2should not 1a tumult] take place among the people. 

6.  A Woman Anoints Jesus  And Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. there came forward to him a woman [2an alabaster flask 3of a perfumed liquid 1having] of a heavy price, and she poured it down upon  his head, as he reclined.

8. [3seeing it 1And  2his disciples], were indignant, saying, For what reason  is this loss?

9. [4would be able 1For 2this  3perfumed liquid] to be sold for much, and to be given to the poor.

10. But knowing,  Jesus said to them, Why [2troubles 1do you make] to the woman? [4work 1for 3a good 2she worked] for me.

11. For at all times [2the 3poor 1you have] with yourselves; but me you do not at all times have.

12. [3laying 1For 2this woman]  this perfumed liquid upon  my body, [2so  3to embalm 4me 1did].

13. Amen I say to you, Where ever [2should be proclaimed  1this good news] in the entire  world, there shall be spoken also what this woman did, for a memorial of her.

14. Then having gone, one of the twelve, the one being called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priest,

15. said, What do you want to give me, and I [2to you 1will deliver him up]? And they established to him thirty silver pieces.

16. And from then he sought an opportune time that he should deliver him up. 

17.  The Last Passover And on the first day of the unleavened breads, [3came forward 1the 2disciples] to Jesus, saying to him, Where do you want we should prepare for you to eat the passover?

18. And he said, Go into the city, to  a certain person, and say to him! The teacher says,  My time is near; with you I will observe the passover with  my disciples.

19. And [3did 1the 2disciples] as [2gave orders 3to them  1Jesus]; and they prepared the passover.

20. And evening becoming, he reclined with the twelve.

21. And during their eating he said, Amen I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.

22. And fretting exceedingly, they began to say to him, each of them, By no means I am he, O Lord.

23. And he responding said, The one dipping [3with 4me 5in 6the 7saucer 1the 2hand], this one will deliver me up.

24. Indeed the son  of man goes away, as it has been written concerning him; but woe to that man by whom the son  of man is delivered up. It was good to him if [2was not 3born  1that man].

25. And responding Judas the one delivering him up, said, Not I am he, Rabbi? He says to him, You said it.

26. [3eating 1And 2during their], Jesus having taken the bread, and having blessed, broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take! eat! this is  my body.

27. And having taken the cup, and giving thanks, he gave to them, saying, You drink of it all!

28. For this is  my blood, the blood of the new covenant, the one for many, being poured out for a release of sins.

29. And I say to you, that in no way shall I drink from now on from this, the offspring of the grapevine, until  that day, whenever I should drink it with you new in the kingdom, the one of my father.

30. And having sung praise, they went forth unto the mount of the olives.

31. Then [2says 3to them  1Jesus], All you will be stumbled by me in  this night. For it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and [5will disperse 1the 2sheep 3of the 4flock].

32. And after  my rising, I will go before you into  Galilee.

33. And responding  Peter said to him, If even all were to stumble in you, I at no time shall be made to stumble.

34. [2said 3to him  1Jesus], Amen I say to you, that in this  night, before a rooster calls out, three times you shall totally reject me.

35. [2says 3to him  1Peter], And if it should be necessary for me [2with 3you 1to die], in no way shall I totally reject you. In like manner also all the disciples spoke. 

36.  Agony at Gethsemane Then [2comes 3with 4them  1Jesus] unto a place being called, Gethsemane. And he says to the disciples, Sit here! until of which time going forth I should pray there

37. And taking with him  Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to fret and be anxious.

38. Then he says to them, [2is dejected  1My soul] unto death; remain here and be vigilant with me!

39. And having gone forth a little, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying, O my father, if it is possible, let [2pass 3from 4me  1this cup]! except not as I want, but as you.

40. And he comes to the disciples, and he finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, So were you not able [2one 3hour 1to be vigilant] with me?

41. Be vigilant and pray! that you should not enter into the test. For the spirit is eager, but the flesh weak.

42. Again a second time, having gone forth he prayed, saying, O my father, if it is not possible for this  cup to pass from me, except that I drink it, let [2take place  1your will]!

43. And having come he finds them again sleeping; [4were 1for 2their  3eyes] weighed down.

44. And allowing them, going forth again he prayed a third time, the same word having said,

45. Then he comes to  his disciples, and he says to them, Sleep the remaining, and rest! Behold, [3approaches 1the 2hour], and the son  of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.

46. Arise! we lead on. Behold, [3approaches 1the one 2delivering me up]. 

47.  Jesus Betrayed by a Kiss And yet while he was speaking, behold, Judas one of the twelve came, and with him [2multitude 1a great] with swords and wood spears, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48. And the one delivering him up gave to them a sign, saying, Whom ever I should kiss, it is he; seize him!

49. And immediately having come forward to Jesus, he said, Hail, rabbi! And he kissed him.

50.  And Jesus said to him, Companion, for what reason are you at hand? Then having come forward, they put  hands upon  Jesus, and seized him.

51. And behold, one of the ones with Jesus stretched out the hand, and drew up  his sword, and striking the servant of the chief priest, he removed his  ear.

52. Then [2says 3to him  1Jesus], Return your  sword unto  its place! for all the ones taking the sword [2by 3a sword 1shall die].

53. Or do you think that I am not able just now to call for the aid  of my father, and he will stand by me more than twelve legions of angels?

54. How then should [3be fulfilled 1the 2scriptures], that thus it must take place?

55. In that  hour Jesus said to the multitudes, As against a robber do you come forth with swords and wood spears to seize me? Daily with you I sat teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me.

56. But this entire thing has happened, that [5should be fulfilled 1the 2scriptures 3of the 4prophets]. Then [2the 3disciples 1all] leaving him, fled. 

57.  Jesus Questioned by the Sanhedrin And the ones seizing  Jesus took him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.

58.  And Peter followed him from far off, unto the courtyard of the chief priest. And entering inside he sat down with the officers to see the conclusion.

59. And the chief priests, and the elders, and the [2sanhedrin 1entire] sought false witness against  Jesus, so that they should kill him;

60. and they did not find reason; and many false witnesses having come forward did not find reason. But afterwards [3having come forward 1two 2false witnesses],

61. they said, This one said, I am able to destroy the temple  of God, and in three days to rebuild it.

62. And having risen up, the chief priest said to him, Nothing you answer? What [2these 4you 1do 3bear witness against]?

63.  But Jesus kept silent. And responding the chief priest said to him, I adjure you according to the [2God  1living], that to us you should say if you are the Christ, the son  of God.

64. [2says 3to him  1Jesus], You said it. Furthermore I say to you, From now you shall see the son  of man sitting down at the right hand of the power, and coming upon the clouds of the heaven.

65. Then the chief priest tore  his garments, saying that, He blasphemed; what still [2need 1do we have] of witnesses? See! now you heard  his blasphemy.

66. What do you think? And they responding, said, [2liable 3of death 1He is].

67. Then they spat in  his face; and buffeted him, and some slapped,

68. saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one hitting you? 

69.  Peter Denies Jesus  And Peter outside was sitting in the courtyard. And came forward to him one maidservant, saying, Even you were with Jesus the Galilean.

70. But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what you say.

71. [3coming forth 1And 2in his] into the vestibule, [2beheld 3him 1another]. And he says to them there, Even this one was with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. And again he denied with an oath, that, I do not know the man.

73. [2after 3a little while 1And 6having come forward 4the ones 5standing] said to Peter, Truly even you [2of 3them 1are]; for even  your speech [2manifest 1makes you].

74. Then he began to bind by a curse and swear by an oath that, I have not known the man. And immediately a rooster called out.

75. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, having said to him that, Before a rooster calls out, three times you shall totally reject me. And having gone forth outside he wept bitterly.  

## Matthew 27

1.  The Council Condemns Jesus And the morning having become, [5council 4took 1all 2the 3chief priests], and the elders of the people against  Jesus, so as to put him to death.

2. And having bound him, they took and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, to the governor. 

3.  Judas Hangs Himself Then [4beholding 1Judas 2the one 3delivering him up], that he was condemned, changed his mind so as to return the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and to the elders,

4. saying, I sinned, having delivered up [2blood 1innocent]. But they said, What is that to us? You shall see to that.

5. And having tossed the silver pieces in the temple, he withdrew. And having gone forth he hung himself.

6. But the chief priests having taken the silver pieces, said, It is not allowed to throw them into the offering when [2the value 3for blood 1it is].

7. [3council 1And 2taking], they bought with them the field of the potter for a burial ground  for strangers.

8. Therefore [2is called  1that field], Field of blood, until  today.

9. Then was fulfilled the thing having been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And I took the thirty silver pieces, the value of the one being valued, the one who was valued by the sons of Israel.

10. And they gave them for the field of the potter as [2gave orders 3to me 1the Lord]. 

11.  Pontius Pilate Questions Jesus  And Jesus stood before the governor. And [3asked 4him 1the 2governor], saying, Are you the king of the Jews?  And Jesus said to him, You say it.

12. And in the charging him by the chief priests and the elders, [2nothing 1he answered].

13. Then [2says 3to him  1Pilate], Do you not hear how much they witness against you?

14. And he did not answer to him to not even one word; so that [3marveled 1the 2governor] exceedingly.

15. And according to the holiday [3was accustomed 1the 2governor] to release one [2to the 3multitude 1prisoner], whom they wanted.

16. And they had then [2prisoner 1a notorious] being called Barabbas.

17. [2being gathered together 3then 1Of their], [2said 3to them  1Pilate], Whom do you want I release to you? Barabbas or Jesus, the one being called, Christ.

18. For he knew that on account of envy they delivered him up.

19. [3sitting down 1And 2of his] upon the rostrum, [2sent 3to 4him  1his wife], saying, Let there be nothing between you and  that just one; [3much 1for 2I suffered] today by a dream concerning him.

20. But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for  Barabbas, and Jesus should perish.

21. And responding the governor said to them, Who do you want from the two I should release to you? And they said, Barabbas.

22. [2says 3to them  1Pilate], What then shall I do with Jesus the one being called Christ? [2say 3to him 1all], Let him be crucified!

23. And the governor said, For what evil did he do? And they extremely more cried out, saying, Let him be crucified!

24. [3seeing 1And  2Pilate] that in nothing he derived benefit, but rather [2a tumult 1it became], having taken water, he washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood  of this just one; you shall see to it.

25. And responding all the people said,  His blood is upon us and upon  our children. 

26.  Jesus Scourged Then he released to them  Barabbas.  And scourging Jesus, he delivered him up that he should be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken with them  Jesus to the praetorium, gathered against him the entire  cohort.

28. And stripping him, they put on him [2military cloak 1a scarlet].

29. And having plaited a crown of thorns, they placed it upon  his head, and a reed in  his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail,  king of the Jews!

30. And having spit on him, they took the reed, and beat upon  his head.

31. And when they mocked him, they took [3off 4him 1the 2military cloak], and they put on him  his garments; and they took him to  be crucified.

32. And going forth, they found [2man 1a Cyrenaean], by name Simon. This one they conscripted that he should bear  his cross.

33. And having come unto a place being called Golgotha, which is being called, [2of the skull 1place],

34. they gave to him to drink vinegar, [2with 3bile 1being mixed]. And having tasted, he did not want to drink. 

35.  Jesus Crucified And having crucified him, they divided  his garments, casting a lot; that should be fulfilled the thing having been spoken by the prophet, They divided  my garments among themselves, and over  my clothes they cast a lot.

36. And sitting down they kept him there.

37. And they placed above  his head  his accusation being written -- This is Jesus the king of the Jews.

38. Then were crucified with him two robbers, one at his right and one at his left.

39. And the ones coming near blasphemed him, shaking  their heads,

40. and saying, O one destroying the temple, and in three days rebuilding it, deliver yourself! If you are the son  of God, come down from the cross!

41. And in like manner also the chief priests mocking with the scribes and elders, said,

42. Others he delivered, himself he is not able to deliver. If [2king 3of Israel 1he is], let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe upon him!

43. He relied upon  God; let him rescue him now! if he wants him. For he said that, [3of God 1I am 2the son].

44. And the same way also the robbers  being crucified along with him berated him.

45. And from the sixth hour darkness came upon all the land until [2hour 1the ninth].

46. And around the ninth hour Jesus yelled out [2voice 1with a great], saying, Eli, Eli, lima sabacthani; that is, My God, My God, why have you abandoned me?

47. And some of the ones standing there having heard, said that, [2calls Elijah 1This one].

48. And immediately [4running 1one 2of 3them], and taking a sponge, filling also of vinegar, and putting it on a reed gave him to drink.

49. And the rest said, Let go! we should see if Elijah comes delivering him.

50.  And Jesus again, having cried out [2voice 1with a great], let go the spirit.

51. And behold, the veil of the temple was split in two from above unto below; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks split;

52. and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the [2sleeping 1holy ones] arose;

53. and having come forth from out of the tombs, after  his rising up, entered into the holy city, and were revealed to many.

54.  And the centurion, and the ones with him keeping guard over  Jesus, having beheld the earthquake, and the things happening, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly [2son of God 1this was].

55. And were there [2women 1many] from far off viewing, ones who followed  Jesus from  Galilee, serving to him;

56. among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the  [2of James 3and 4Joses 1mother], and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 

57.  The Burial of Jesus And evening having become, there came [2man 1a rich] from Arimathea, by name Joseph, who also himself was discipled by Jesus.

58. This one having come forward to Pilate, asked the body  of Jesus. Then  Pilate bid to give the body.

59. And having taken the body,  Joseph swathed it [2fine linen 1with pure],

60. and he placed it in  his new sepulchre, which he quarried in the rock. And having rolled [2stone 1a great] for the door of the sepulchre, he went forth.

61. And was there, Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting down before the tomb.

62. And the next day, which is after the preparation, were gathered together the chief priests and the Pharisees to Pilate,

63. saying, O master, we remember that, that  deluded one said, while still living, After three days I arise.

64. Bid then to safeguard the tomb until the third day! lest at any time [2coming  1his disciples] at night should steal it, and should say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and will be the last delusion worse than the first.

65. [3said 1And 4to them  2Pilate], You have a custodial guard, Go away! You safeguard as you know!

66. And the ones having gone safeguarded the tomb, setting a seal upon the stone by the custodial guard.  

## Matthew 28

1.  The Resurrection of Jesus And late on Sabbath, in the evening on day one of Sabbath, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to view the tomb.

2. And behold, [2earthquake 3took place 1a great]; for an angel of the Lord having come down from out of heaven, having come forward, rolled the stone from the door, and was sitting down upon it.

3. [3was 1And  2his shape] as lightning, and  his garment white as snow.

4. And from the fear of him [3shook 1the ones 2keeping guard], and became as dead.

5. [4responding 1And 2the 3angel] said to the women, [3not 2fear 1You]! for I know that [2Jesus 3the one 4having been crucified 1you seek].

6. He is not here, for he is risen as he said. Come, behold the place where [2was situated  1the Lord]!

7. And quickly going, say to his disciples! that, He is risen from the the dead, and behold, he goes before you into  Galilee; there you shall see him. Behold, I told to you.

8. And having gone forth quickly from the sepulchre with fear and [2joy 1great], they ran to report to his disciples.

9. As they were going to report to his disciples, that behold,  Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they having come forward held his  feet, and did obeisance to him.

10. Then [2says 3to them  1Jesus], Fear not! Go! report to my brethren! that they should go forth into  Galilee, and there they shall see me.

11. [3going 1And 2of their], behold, some of the custodial guard having come into the city reported to the chief priests all the things happening.

12. And having gathered together with the elders, and council having taken, [5silver 4enough 1they gave 2the 3soldiers],

13. saying, Say that,  His disciples [2by night 1having come] stole him, of us being asleep!

14. And if this should be heard by the governor, we shall persuade him, and [2you 3free from care 1we will make].

15. And they having taken the money, did as they were taught. And was spread abroad  this word by the Jews unto  today. 

16.  The Eleven Ordered But the eleven disciples went into  Galilee, unto the mountain where [2ordered 3them  1Jesus].

17. And seeing him, they did obeisance to him; but some hesitated.

18. And having come forward,  Jesus spoke to them, saying, [3was given 4to me 1All 2authority] in heaven and upon earth.

19. Going then, disciple all the nations! immersing them in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit.

20. Teaching them to give heed to all as much as I gave charge to you. And behold, I [2with 3you 1am] all the days until the completion of the age. Amen.
