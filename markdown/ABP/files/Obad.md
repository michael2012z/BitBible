# Obadiah

## Obadiah 1

1.  The Vision Concerning Edom The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the lord  God to Edom. [2a report 1I heard] from the lord, and a summary he sent out unto the nations, saying, Rise up! even we should rise up against her for battle.

2. Behold, [3very few 1I have made 2you] among the nations, disgracing you exceedingly.

3. Pride  of your heart lifted you up, encamping in the openings of the rocks, exalting his dwelling, saying in his heart, Who shall lead me down unto the ground?

4. If you should rise up on high as an eagle, and if in the midst of the stars you should put your nest, from there I will lead you down, says the lord.

5. If thieves entered to you, or robbers by night, where would you be thrown away? Would they not have stolen the things fit for themselves? And if grape gatherers entered to you, would they not have left behind a gleaning?

6. How was Esau searched out, and [2forsaken  1his hidden things]?

7. Unto the borders they sent you; all the men  of your covenant opposed you; they prevailed against you; [2men 1peaceable] with you put an ambush underneath you. There is no understanding in them.

8. In  that day, says the lord, I will destroy the wise ones from out of  Edom, and understanding from the mount of Esau. 

9.  Esau to be Removed And [2shall be terrified  1your warriors], the ones from Teman, so that [2shall be removed 1man] from the mountain of Esau.

10. Because of the slaughter and the impiety against your brother Jacob, [2shall cover 3you 1shame], and you shall be removed into the eon.

11. From which day you opposed right opposite, in the day of the capturing by foreigners of his force, and strangers entered into his gates, and over Jerusalem they cast lots, even you were as one of them.

12. And you should not have looked upon the day of your brother in the day of strangers; and you should not have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day of their destruction; and you should not have spoken great words in the day of their affliction;

13. nor should you have entered into the gates of peoples in the day of their miseries; and you should not have looked, even you,  upon their gathering in the day of their ruin; and you should not have joined in an attack upon  their force in the day of their destruction;

14. nor should you have stood upon  their mountain passes to utterly destroy the ones escaping of them; nor should you have closed up the ones fleeing from them in the day of their affliction. 

15.  The Day of The LORD For [4is near 1the 2day 3of the lord] upon all the nations. In which manner you did, so it will be to you.  Your recompense shall be recompensed unto your head.

16. For in which manner you drank upon  [2mountain  1my holy], [4shall drink 1so all 2the 3nations] wine; they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as not having existed. 

17.  Deliverance on Mount Zion But on  mount Zion there will be deliverance, and there will be a holy place. And [4shall inherit 1the 2house 3of Jacob] the ones inheriting them.

18. And [4will be 1the 2house 3of Jacob] fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, but the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall be burnt in them, and they shall devour them; and there will not be a wheat harvest to the house of Esau; for the lord spoke.

19. And [4shall inherit 1the ones 2in 3the Negev] the mountain  of Esau, even the ones dwelling in the Sephela of the Philistines. And they shall inherit the mountain of Ephraim, and the plain of Samaria, and Benjamin, and the land of Gilead.

20. And the displacement  of this company to the sons of Israel shall inherit that of the Canaanites, unto Zarephath; and the displacement of Jerusalem, unto Ephratah, shall inherit the cities of the Negev.

21. And [2shall ascend 1the ones being rescued] from mount Zion  to take vengeance on the mountain of Esau; and [3will be 4to the 5 lord 1the 2kingdom].
