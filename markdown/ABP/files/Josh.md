## Joshua 1

1.  Joshua Succeeds Moses And it came to pass after the decease of Moses the servant of the lord, that the lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun, the aid of Moses, saying,

2. Moses,  my attendant has come to an end; now then rising up, pass over the Jordan! you, and all  this people, into the land which I give to them.

3. Every  place upon which ever you should mount the track  of your feet, [3to you 1I will give 2it], in which manner I spoke  to Moses.

4. The wilderness and the Antilebanon unto the [2river  1great], the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the [2sea  1great] from [2of the sun 1the descent] will be  your boundaries.

5. [2shall not 3withstand 1A man] before you all the days  of your life. And as I was with Moses, so I will be also with you, and I will not abandon you, nor will I neglect you.

6. Be strong and manly! for you shall divide up  to this people the land which I swore by an oath to your fathers to give to them.

7. Be strong then and manly! to guard and to do in so far as I gave charge  Moses  my servant. And do not turn aside from them to the right or to the left! that you should perceive in all what ever you should act on.

8. And [5shall not 6leave  2book 3of the 4law 1this] from  your mouth, and you shall meditate in it day and night, that you should perceive to do all the things written in it. Then you shall prosper  your ways, and then you shall perceive.

9. Behold, I give charge to you; be strong and be manly! You should not be timid, nor should you be terrified, for [3is with 4you 1the lord  2your God] in every place where ever you should go. 

10.  Joshua Gives Charge to the Scribes And Joshua gave charge to the scribes of the people, saying,

11. Enter in the midst of the camp of the people, and give charge to the people! saying, Prepare provisions! for yet in three days even you pass over  this Jordan, entering to take control of the land which the lord  God  of your fathers gives to you.

12. And  to Reuben, and to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,

13. Remember the word of the lord! which [5gave charge 6to you 1Moses 2the 3servant 4of the lord], saying, The lord  your God rested you, and gave to you  this land.

14.  Your wives, and  your children, and  your cattle -- let them dwell in the land which [2gave 3to you 1Moses] on the other side of the Jordan! And you shall pass over well-equipped prior to  your brethren, every one  being strong, and you shall fight along with them,

15. until whenever [3should rest 1the lord  2your God]  your brethren, as also you; and so they shall be heir also to this  land which the lord  your God gives to them. Then you shall go forth each unto  his own inheritance, which [2gave 3to you 1Moses] on the other side of the Jordan from the east sun.

16. And answering to Joshua, they said, All as much as you should give charge to us we will do, and into every place where ever you should send us, we will go.

17. According to all as much as we hearkened to Moses, we will hearken to you. Furthermore let [3be 1the lord  2our God] with you, in which manner he was with Moses!

18. And the man who ever should resist you, and who ever should not hearken to  your words, in so far as you should give charge to him, let him die! But be strong and be manly!  

## Joshua 2

1.  Rahab Houses the Spies And [4sent 1Joshua 2son 3of Nun] from out of Shittin two men to spy, saying, Ascend and behold the land and  Jericho! And going, they entered into a house of a woman harlot, whose name was Rahab, and they rested up there.

2. And it was reported to the king of Jericho, saying, [2have entered 3here 1Men] of the sons of Israel to spy out the land.

3. And [4sent 1the 2king 3of Jericho], and said to Rahab, saying, Lead out the men! the ones entering into  your house in the night, [3to spy out 1for 4the 5land 2they have come].

4. And [3taking 1the 2woman] the two men hid them. And she said to them, saying, [3entered 4to 5me 1The 2men], and I know not from where they were.

5. But as the gate was locked in the darkness, and the men went forth, I do not know where they went. You pursue after them! and you shall overtake them.

6. But she brought them upon the roof, and hid them in the stalk of flax  having been piled by her upon the roof.

7. And the men pursued after them on the way unto the Jordan near the ford, and the gate was locked.

8. And it came to pass as [5went forth 1the ones 2pursuing 3after 4them], and before  their going to sleep, that she ascended upon the roof to them.

9. And she said to them, I know that [2gave 5to you 1the lord 3the 4land]; [5has fallen 1for 2the 3fear 4of you] upon us, and [6are struck with awe 1all 2the ones 3dwelling 4the 5land] of you.

10. For we have heard that [3totally dried up 1the lord  2God] the [2sea  1red] before your face, when you went forth from out of Egypt, and as much as you did to the two kings of the Amorites, the ones who were on the other side of the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, of which you utterly destroyed them.

11. And having heard, we were amazed in our heart, and there was no [3established 1longer 2a spirit] in any one because of your presence; for the lord  your God is the God in heaven upward, and upon the earth below.

12. And now, swear by an oath to me by the lord  God! for I performed an act of mercy to you, and you shall also perform yourself an act of mercy in the house  of my father, And you shall give to me [2sign 1a true].

13. Take alive the house  of my father, and  my mother, and  my brothers, and  my sisters, and all  of my house, and all as much as is theirs! And you shall rescue  our life from death.

14. And [3said 4to her 1the 2men],  Our life for yours, even unto death. And she said, Whenever the lord should deliver up [3to you 1the 2city], you shall perform for me an act of mercy and truth.

15. And she let them down through the window, for  her house was in the wall, and in the wall she dwelt.

16. And she said to them, [2into 3the 4mountainous area 1Go forth], lest there should meet up with you the ones pursuing! And you shall be hidden there three days until whenever [5should return 1the ones 2pursuing 3after 4you]; and after this you shall go forth into  your way.

17. And [3said 4to 5her 1the 2men], We are innocent  [2your oath 1in this].

18. Behold, as we enter into a part of the city, then you shall place  a sign --  [3string  2this scarlet 1you shall suspend] in the window through which you let us down through it. And  your father, and  your mother, and  your brothers, and all the house  of your father, you shall bring together to yourself into  your house.

19. And it will be any which ever should come forth by the door  of your house unto outside, [2liable 3to himself 1shall be], and we will be innocent  [2your oath 1in this]. And as many as should be with you in  your house, we will be liable if a hand should have touched him.

20. But if anyone should wrong us, and should uncover  [2our words 1these], we will be innocent  [2your oath 1in this], which we bound you by.

21. And she said to them, According to  your word thus let it be! And she sent them out, and they went. And she tied the [2sign  1scarlet] in the window.

22. And they went, and they came unto the mountainous area, and they stayed there three days, until [3returned 1the ones 2following]. And [3sought after them 1the 2ones pursuing] in all the ways, and did not find.

23. And [4returned 1the 2two 3young men], and they went down from out of the mountain, and passed over, and came to  Joshua son of Nun. And they described to him all the things coming to pass to them.

24. And they said to Joshua that, The lord has delivered all the land in our hand, and [4are struck with awe 1all  2dwelling  3in that land] at us.  

## Joshua 3

1.  Israel Crosses the Jordan And Joshua rose early in the morning. And they departed from Shittin, and they came unto the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel. And they rested up there before  passing over.

2. And it came to pass after three days, [3went 1that the 2scribes] through the camp.

3. And they gave charge to the people, saying, Whenever you should behold the ark of the covenant of the lord  our God, and the priests, and the Levites lifting it, that you shall depart from  your place and go after it!

4. But let there be a far space between you and that ark, as much as two thousand cubits! You shall stand -- you should not draw near it, that you should know the way which you go by it. [3not 1For 2you have] gone the way either yesterday or the third day before.

5. And Joshua said to the people, Be sanctified by the morrow! for tomorrow the lord shall do [2among 3you 1wonders].

6. And Joshua said to the priests, saying, Lift the ark of the covenant of the lord, and go before in front of the people! And [3lifted 1the 2priests] the ark of the covenant of the lord, and they went in front of the people.

7. And the lord said to Joshua, On  this day I begin  to raise you up high in front of all the sons of Israel, that they should know in so far as I was with Moses, so shall I also be with you.

8. And now give charge to the priests  lifting the ark of the covenant! saying, As soon as you should enter upon a part of the water of the Jordan, then in the Jordan you shall stand.

9. And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Lead forward here and hearken to the word of the lord  your God!

10. And Joshua said, In this you shall know that God is living among you, and by annihilating he will annihilate from our face the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.

11. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passes over [3before 4you 1the 2Jordan].

12. And now handpick for yourselves twelve men from the sons of Israel, one from each tribe!

13. And it will be as whenever [5shall rest 1the 2feet 3of the 4priests], of the ones lifting the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth in the water of the Jordan, the water of the Jordan shall fail, and the water  going down shall stand from above as a heap.

14. And it happened as [3departed 1the 2people] from out of  their tents, to pass over the Jordan, that the priests lifted the ark of the covenant of the lord in front of the people.

15. And as [3entered 1the 2priests]  lifting the ark of the covenant unto the Jordan, that the feet of the priests  lifting the ark were dipped into a part of the water of the Jordan, and the Jordan filled up [2entire  3bank 1its] as in days of harvest,

16. and [3stood 1the 2waters]  going down from above, it stood as a bank of water in abstaining far off, very vehemently unto Adam the city, unto the part of Kirjath Jearim. And the part going down went down into the sea of Araba, the sea  of salts, unto  the end were it ceased. And the people stood before Jericho.

17. And [3stood 1the 2priests], the ones lifting the ark of the covenant of the lord, upon dry land in the midst of the Jordan ready. And all the sons of Israel passed over through dry land, until of which time [4completed 1all 2the 3people] passing over the Jordan.  

## Joshua 4

1.  Twelve Memorial Stones And when [4completed 1all 2the 3people] passing over the Jordan, that the lord spoke to Joshua, saying,

2. Taking twelve men from the people, [2man 1one] from each tribe,

3. give orders to them! saying, Take up to yourselves from here from the midst of the Jordan, from the station of the feet of the priests, [2prepared 1twelve] stones! And these, in carrying [2across 3together 4with you 1them], put them in  your military encampment! where ever you should camp there the night.

4. And Joshua calling by name twelve men of the honorable ones from the sons of Israel, [2man 1one] from each tribe,

5. [2said 3to them 1Joshua], Lead forward before the presence of the lord  your God into the midst of the Jordan! And by taking up, lift away from there each [2stone 1one] upon  his shoulders, according to the number of the tribes  of Israel!

6. That [2should exist 3to you 1these] for a sign, being situated always; that whenever [2should ask 3you  1your son] tomorrow, saying, What are  these stones to you?

7. And you shall make manifest to your son, saying that, [4ceased 1The 2Jordan 3river] from in front of the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth as it passed over the Jordan -- even [5ceased 1the 2water 3of the 4Jordan]. And [2shall be  1these stones] to you a memorial to the sons of Israel unto the eon.

8. And [4did 5thus 1the 2sons 3of Israel], in so far as the lord gave charge  to Joshua. And taking twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, just as the lord gave orders  to Joshua, in the completion of the fording of the sons of Israel, that they carried them across together themselves into the camp, and they put them aside there.

9. [3set 1And 2Joshua] also another twelve stones in [3itself 1the 2Jordan], in the [2being 1place] under the feet of the priests  lifting the ark of the covenant of the lord. And they are there until  today's day.

10. [4stood 1And 2the 3priests], the ones lifting the ark of the covenant, in the midst the Jordan, until of which he completed all the words which the lord gave charge to Joshua to announce to the people, according to all as much as Moses gave charge to Joshua. And [3hastened 1the 2people], and passed over.

11. And it came to pass as [4completed 1all 2the 3people] to pass over, that [6passed over 1the 2ark 3of the 4covenant 5of the lord], and the priests in front of them.

12. And there passed over the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, being equipped in front of the sons of Israel, just as Moses gave charge to them.

13. Forty thousand well-equipped for battle passed over before the lord for war against  Jericho the city.

14. In that  day the lord increased  Joshua before all of Israel, and they feared him as they feared  Moses, as much time as he lived.

15. And the lord spoke  to Joshua, saying,

16. Give charge to the priests  lifting the ark of the covenant of the testimony! to go up out of the Jordan.

17. And Joshua gave charge to the priests, saying, Go up out of the Jordan!

18. And it came to pass as [3went up 1the 2priests], the ones lifting the ark of the covenant of the lord, from the midst of the Jordan, that [3put 4the 5feet 1the 2priests] upon the dry land, and [5advanced 1the 2water 3of the 4Jordan] according to place, and it went as also yesterday and the third day before, through all  its bank.

19. And the people ascended from out of the Jordan on the tenth of the [2month  1first]. And [4bivouacked 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in Gilgal in the part  towards the sun, rising by  Jericho.

20. And  [2twelve 3stones 1these] which he took from out of the Jordan, Joshua set in Gilgal.

21. And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, Whenever [2ask  1your sons 4tomorrow 3you], saying, What are  these stones?

22. You announce to your sons! saying that, [3upon 4dry ground 1Israel passed over  2this Jordan].

23. [3caused 8to dry up 1The lord  2our God 4the 5water 6of the 7Jordan] from  in front of them, until of which time they passed over, just as [3did 1the lord  2our God] to the [2sea  1red], which [3caused to dry up 1the lord  2God] in front of us until we went by.

24. So that [6might know 1all 2the 3nations 4of the 5earth] that the power of the lord is strong, and that you should worship the lord  our God at all time.  

## Joshua 5

1.  Israel Circumcised at Gilgal And it came to pass as [4heard 1all 2the 3kings] (the kings of the Amorites  who were on the other side of the Jordan by the sea, and all the kings  of Phoenicia  by the sea) that [3caused 7to dry up 1the lord  2God 4the 5Jordan 6river] from  before the sons of Israel in  their passing over, that [2melted away  1their thoughts], and they were struck with terror, and there was not among them [2with intellect 1any one] because of the presence of the sons of Israel.

2. And about this  time the lord said  to Joshua, Make for yourself [2knives 1flint rock], and sitting down circumcise the sons of Israel  a second time!

3. And [2made 3for himself 1Joshua 5knives 4flint rock], and he circumcised the sons of Israel upon the [2being called 1place], Hill of Foreskins.

4. And this is the account for which Joshua circumcised all the people, the ones coming forth from Egypt. [2the male 1All] men of war  that died in the wilderness in the way of their coming forth from the land of Egypt,

5. that [6circumcised 5were 1all 2the 3people  4coming forth]. And all the people  being born in the wilderness, in the way of their coming forth from the land of Egypt were not circumcised. For forty years Israel paced in the wilderness.

6. Therefore [3were uncircumcised  1most 2of them] of the ones for combat, of the ones coming forth from out of the land of Egypt, the ones resisting the commandments of the lord  God; and the ones whom [2separated 1the lord] to them, [2to not behold 1for them] the land which the lord swore by an oath to our fathers to give to us, a land flowing milk and honey.

7.  Their sons he firmed instead of these, whom Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised on account of  them being born along the way of uncircumcised ones.

8. And being circumcised, all the nation [2rest 1had] at that time, sitting down in the camp until they were healed.

9. And the lord said to Joshua, In  today's day I removed the scorn of Egypt from you. And he called the name  of that place, Gilgal, until  this day.

10. And [4camped 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in Gilgal. And they observed the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, at the descent of Jericho in the plain.

11. And they ate from the grain of the land on the next day of the passover -- unleavened breads and new corn. 

12.  The Manna Fails On  this day [3failed 1the 2manna], on the next day after  their eating from the grain of the land, and no longer [2existed 3to the 4sons 5of Israel 1manna]. And they gathered fruit of the place of the Phoenicians in  that year.

13. And it came to pass as Joshua was in Jericho, that lifting up  his eyes, he beheld a man standing before him, and  his broadsword was unsheathed in  his hand. And coming forward,  Joshua said to him, Are you ours or of our opponents?

14.  And he said to him that, I am the commander-in-chief of the force of the lord, now I have come. And Joshua fell upon his face upon the ground, and he did obeisance, and he said to him, My master what do you assign to your servant?

15. And [4says 1the 2commander-in-chief 3of the lord] to Joshua, Untie  your sandal from  your feet! for the place upon which you stand upon it is holy. And Josua did thus.  

## Joshua 6

1.  Israel Arrives at Jericho And Jericho was closed up, and fortified from before the sons of Israel. And no one went forth from out of it, and neither entered.

2. And the lord said to Joshua, Behold, I deliver up to you [3under your hand 2to you  1Jericho], and  its king, the one in it, and the mighty ones in strength.

3. And let [4circle 5the 6city 1all 2men 3of war] round about the city! Once thus they shall do for six days.

4. And seven priests shall take seven horns of the ram before the ark. And on the [2day  1seventh] circle the city seven times! and the priests shall trump the horns.

5. And it will be as whenever you should sound the trumpet of the ram, in  your hearing the sound of the horn, let [4shout aloud 1all 2the 3people]! And with their shouting aloud [5shall fall 6by themselves 1the 2walls 3of the 4city] underneath them, and [4shall enter 1all 2the 3people], [2advancing 1each] in front into the city.

6. And [4entered 1Joshua 2the son 3of Nun] to the priests, and he said to them, You take the ark of the covenant! and seven priests shall take seven horns of the ram, according to the front of the ark of the lord.

7. And he said to them, saying, Exhort the people to go around and circle the city, and [2the ones 3for combat 1let] come near! arming themselves before the ark of the lord.

8. And it came to pass as Joshua spoke to the people, that the seven priests having seven [2trumpets 1consecrated] also went by likewise before the lord, and they passed and signified intensely. And the ark of the covenant of the lord followed after them.

9. And the ones for combat came near in front. And the priests trumpeting the horns, and the rest of the multitude all together after the ark of the covenant of the lord, were going and trumpeting with the horns.

10. And to the people Joshua gave charge, saying, Do not yell nor let [2hear 1any one]  your voice! There shall not go through from your mouth a word until whenever he himself declares the day to yell out, and you shall yell out then.

11. And [6having gone around 1the 2ark 3of the 4covenant  5of God] the city round about, immediately they went forth into the camp, and spent the night there.

12. And on the [2day  1second] Joshua rose up in the morning, and [3lifted 1the 2priests] the ark of the lord.

13. And the seven priests, the ones bringing the seven [2trumpets  1consecrated] before the ark the lord went forth, and the priests trumping the trumpets, and after these, there entered the ones for combat, and the remaining multitude all together were behind the ark of the covenant of the lord, going and trumping with the horns. 

14.  Israel Encircles Jericho Seven Times And they encircled the city on the [2day  1second], once near to it; and they went forth again into the camp. So it was done for six days.

15. And it came to pass on the [2day  1seventh 5rose up 3the 4expedition]  at dawn and went around the city according to  this practice seven times, only on  that day they circled the city seven times.

16. And it came to pass in the [2circuit  1seventh 5trumped 3the 4priests] with trumpets, and Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Cry out, [3delivered up 1for 2the lord] the city to you!

17. And [3will be 1the 2city] an offering for consumption, it and all as much as is in it, to the lord of the forces. Except Rahab the harlot -- protect her, and all as much as is of hers in the house! for she hid the messengers whom we sent.

18. But you guard from the offering for consumption! lest at any time pondering, you should take of the offering for consumption, and should make the camp of the sons of Israel an offering for consumption, and he should obliterate us.

19. And all silver or gold, and all brass and iron, will be holy to the lord; [2into 3the treasury 4of the lord 1it shall be carried]. 

20.  The Wall of Jericho Falls And [3shouted 1the 2people], and [3trumped 4the 5trumpets 1the 2priests]. And as [3heard 1the 2people] the sound of the trumpets, [4shouted 1all 2the 3people] [4shout 1a great 2and 3strong]. And [3fell 1the 2wall] round about; and [3ascended 1the 2people] into the city, each at his opposite, and overtook the city.

21. And they devoted it to consumption, and as much as was in the city, from man and unto woman, from young and unto old, and unto calf and sheep and beast of burden, by the mouth of the broadsword.

22. And to the two young men  spying out the land, Joshua said, You enter into the house of the woman, the harlot, and lead her from there, and all as much as is with her, as you swore by an oath to her!

23. And [4entered 1the 2two 3young men], the ones spying out the city, into the house of the woman; and they led out Rahab the harlot, and  her father, and  her mother, and  her brothers, and all as much as was to her, and  her kin. And they placed her outside the camp of Israel.

24. And the city was burned by fire with all the things in it. Except silver and gold and all brass and iron they yielded up unto the treasury to be carried in.

25. And Rahab the harlot, and all the house  of her father, and all the things of hers, Joshua took alive. And she dwelt in  Israel until the day today, because she hid the ones spying which Joshua sent to spy out  Jericho.

26. And Joshua bound them by an oath in  that day, saying, Accursed is the man who before the lord, who shall raise up or shall build  that city  Jericho; with  his first-born he will lay the foundation for it, and with the least of his he shall set the gates of it.

27. And the lord was with Joshua, and [2was  1his name] in all the land.  

## Joshua 7

1.  Achan's Trespass And [4trespassed 1the 2sons 3of Israel] a trespass, and pilfered from the offering for consumption. And Achan took (son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah) from the offering for consumption. And [3was enraged 1the anger 2of the lord] with the sons of Israel.

2. And Joshua sent men from Jericho unto Ai, which is by Beth-aven, according to the east of Beth-el. And he spoke to to them, saying, In ascending, survey the land! And [3ascended 1the 2men] and surveyed  Ai.

3. And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Do not let [4ascend 1all 2the 3people], but about two thousand or three thousand men, let them ascend! And let them capture the city! You should not lead there all the people, [3few 1for 2they are].

4. And ascended from the people there about three thousand men. And they fled from the face of the men of Ai. 

5.  Israel Defeated at Ai And [3killed 4of 5them 1the men 2of Ai] about thirty-six men, and they pursued them from the gate until they defeated them. And they struck them by the incline. And [5was terrified 1the 2heart 3of the 4people], and it became as water.

6. And Joshua tore  his garments, and fell upon his face upon the earth before the ark of the lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust upon  their heads.

7. And Joshua said, I beseech, O Lord, O lord, why in causing to pass over was [2caused to pass over  1your servant]  this people the Jordan, to deliver it to the Amorite to destroy us? And if we stayed and were settled by the Jordan, what is it to me, O lord.

8. And what shall I say when Israel turned the back of the neck before  its enemy?

9. And hearing, the Canaanite and all the ones dwelling in the land shall surround us, and shall obliterate us from the land. And what will you do  [3name 1for your  2great]?

10. And the lord said to Joshua, Rise up! Why do you do this -- fall upon your face?

11. [3have sinned 1The 2people], and violated  my covenant which I ordained with it. For even they took from the offering for consumption, and stealing they lie, and they cast [3for 1the 2items] themselves.

12. And [4in no way 5will be able 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to stand in front of  its enemies. [2the back of the neck 1They shall turn] before  their enemies, for they were become an offering for consumption. I will not add any longer to be with you, if you should not lift away the offering for consumption from among you of them.

13. In rising up, purify the people, and tell them to be sanctified for tomorrow! For thus says the lord  God of Israel, The offering devoted for consumption is among you, O Israel; you shall not be able to withstand before  your enemies, until whenever you should lift away the offering for consumption from you.

14. And you shall gather all in the morning according to your tribes. And it will be to the tribe which ever the lord shows, and you shall lead forward according to peoples. And the people which ever the lord shows you shall lead forward according to house. And the house which ever the lord shows, by man you shall lead forward.

15. And who ever should be pointed out in the offering for consumption, he shall be burnt by the fire himself, and all as much as is his; for he violated the covenant of the lord, and that he committed a violation of the law in Israel.

16. And Joshua rose early in the morning, and he led [3forward 1the 2people] by its tribe. And [4was made manifest 1the 2tribe 3of Judah].

17. And [4were made manifest 3people 1the 2Zarhite]. And he led forward [3people 1the 2Zarhite] according to man, and Zabdi was made manifest.

18. And he led forward  his house by man, and was made manifest Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah.

19. And Joshua said  to Achan, O my son, today give indeed glory to the lord God of Israel, and make to him the acknowledgment, and announce to me what you did! and you should not hide it from me.

20. And Achan answered to Joshua, and said, Truly I sinned before the lord God of Israel, so and so I have done.

21. I beheld in the spoils standing bare [3colored robe 1one 2goodly], and two hundred double-drachmas of silver, and [2wedge 3of gold 1one] -- fifty double-drachmas its scale weight. And I coveted them, and I took. And behold, these are hid in the ground in  my tent, and the silver is hid underneath them.

22. And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent in the camp; and these were being hid in  his tent, and the silver underneath them.

23. And they brought them from the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all elders of Israel. And they put them before the lord. 

24.  Achan is Killed And Joshua took  Achan son of Zerah, and the silver, and the robe, and the [2wedge  1gold], and  his sons, and  his daughters, and  his calves, and  his beasts of burden, and  his sheep, and  his tent, and all  his possessions, and all Israel with him. And they led them into Emek Achor.

25. And Joshua said, Why did you annihilate us [2to utterly destroy 3you 1for the lord] even  today? And [3stoned 4him 1all 2Israel] with stones, and they burned them in fire, and they stoned them with stones.

26. And they set over him a heap [2stones 1of great] until  this day. And the lord ceased the rage  of anger. Therefore this is the name of it -- Emek Achor, unto  this day.  

## Joshua 8

1.  Ambush at Ai And the lord said to Joshua, You should not fear, nor should you be timid. Take with you all the men, the ones making war, and rising up ascend unto Ai! Behold, I give into  your hands the king of Ai, and  his people, and  his city, and  his land.

2. And you shall do to Ai, and to her king in which manner you did  to Jericho and to her king. And  her spoils and  her cattle you shall despoil for yourself. But place for yourself an ambush for the city to the rear of her.

3. And Joshua rose up, and all the people, the warriors, so as to ascend to Ai. [3chose 1And 2Joshua] thirty thousand men, mighty in strength, and sent them by night.

4. And he gave charge to them, saying, See that you lie in wait the city, behind the city greatly! and you shall all be prepared.

5. And I, and all the ones with me, will lead forward to the city. And it will be as whenever [4should come forth 1the ones 2dwelling 3in Ai] to meet you, just as also the day before, and we fled from their face,

6. that whenever they should come forth after us, we shall draw them away from the city. And they will say, They flee from our face in which manner before; and we shall flee from them.

7. And you shall rise up from the ambush, and you shall go into the city, and you shall obliterate the city, and [3shall give 4it 1the lord  2our God] into our hands.

8. And it will be when ever you should seize the city, burn it by fire! According to  this matter you shall act. Behold, I have given charge to you.

9. And [2sent 3them 1Joshua], and they went to the ambush, and sat in place between Beth-el and between Ai, from the west  of Ai. And Joshua lodged  that night in the midst of the people.

10. And Joshua rising early in the morning, numbered the people. And they ascended, he and the elders of Israel, before the face of the people, against Ai.

11. And all the people, the warrior, the one with him, ascended. And going, they came right opposite the city from the east. And the ambushes of the city were from the west. And they encamped from north  of Ai. And the valley was between it and  Ai

12. And he took about five thousand men, and he stationed them in ambush between  Beth-el and  Ai, west  of Ai.

13. And he arranged [2the 3people 1all] of the camp, which was from north of the city,  the ends of it west of the city. And Joshua went  that night in the midst of the valley.

14. And it happened as [4beheld 1the 2king 3of Ai], that he hastened and rose early. And there went forth the men of the city to meet them straight on into the battle, he and all  his people at the opportune time, in front of the Araba. And he did not know that an ambush against him is behind the city.

15. And [5beheld 6and 7withdrew 1Joshua 2and 3all 4Israel] from in front of them.

16. And the people fled by the way of the wilderness, and [5grew in strength 1all 2the 3people  4of Ai]  to pursue after them of the sons of Israel. And they departed from the city.

17. They did not leave behind any one in  Ai and in Beth-el who did not pursue after Israel. And they left the city being open, and they pursued after Israel.

18. And the lord said to Joshua, Stretch out  your hand with the javelin, the one in  your hand, against the city, for into  your hands I gave it. And the ones in ambush shall rise up  quickly from out of  their place.

19. And Joshua stretched the javelin and  his hand against the city, and the ones in ambush rose up  quickly from out of  their place. And they went forth when he stretched out the hand. And they entered into the city, and overtook it. And hastening they burned the city in fire.

20. And [4looking about 1the 2inhabitants 3of Ai] unto the rear of them, and they viewed the smoke of the city ascending into the heaven; and no longer had they anywhere to flee here on this side or here on that side. And the people  fleeing into the wilderness turned upon the ones pursuing.

21. And Joshua and all Israel beheld that [3took 1the 2ones in ambush] the city, and that [5ascended 1the 2smoke 3of the 4city] into the heaven; and turning they struck the men  of Ai.

22. And these came forth from the city to meet them. And they came in the midst of the camp, some of these here and some of these here. And they struck them until there was not one being left behind of them being delivered and escaping.

23. And the king  of Ai was seized alive, and they led him to Joshua.

24. And it happened as [4ceased 1the 2sons 3of Israel] killing all the ones in  Ai, and in the plains, and in the mountain upon the descent of which they pursued them, that all fell by the mouth of the broadsword, by it unto completion. And Joshua returned to Ai, and struck it by the mouth of the broadsword.

25. And it came to pass that all the ones falling in that day, from man and unto woman -- twelve thousand, all the ones dwelling in Ai.

26. And Joshua returned not his hand which he stretched out by the javelin until he devoted to consumption the whole of the ones dwelling Ai.

27. Except the cattle and the spoils  in  that city [4despoiled 5for themselves 1the 2sons 3of Israel] according to the order of the lord, in which manner the lord gave orders  to Joshua.

28. And Joshua burned the city by fire, and he established it for an embankment into the eon, uninhabited until  this day.

29. And the king  of Ai he hung upon [2tree 1a twin]. And he was upon the tree until the time of the evening. And at the setting of the sun Joshua gave orders, and they lowered  his body from the tree, and they tossed him into the cesspool before the gate of the city, and set over him [2heap 3of stones 1a large] until  this day.

30. Then Joshua built an altar to the lord  God of Israel on mount Ebal,

31. as [5gave charge 1Moses 2the 3attendant 4of the lord] to the sons of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses, An altar [2stone 1entirely], upon which [2was not 3put 4upon 5it 1an iron tool]. And he transported there whole burnt-offerings to the lord, and a sacrifice of deliverance. 

32.  Joshua Writes the Second Copy of the Law And Joshua wrote upon the stones the second book of the law, the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the sons of Israel.

33. And all Israel, and  their elders, and  their magistrates, and  their scribes, were coming near on this side and that side [2the 3ark 1before]; and the priests and the Levites lifted the ark of the covenant of the lord; and the foreigner and the native born were there; the halves of them neighboring mount Gerizim, and the halves neighboring mount Ebal, as [5gave charge 1Moses 2the 3attendant 4of the lord 8to bless 9the 10people 11Israel 6at 7first].

34. And after these things Joshua read the whole  sayings  of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all the things being written in the law of Moses.

35. There was not a word from all which Moses gave charge to Joshua, which [2did not 3read 1Joshua] into the ears of all the assembly of Israel, to the men, and to the women, and to the servants, and to the foreigners  going  with Israel.  

## Joshua 9

1.  Gibeon Misleads Joshua And as they all heard (the kings of the Amorites on the other side of the Jordan, the ones in the mountainous area, and the ones on the plain, and the ones in all the coast of the [2sea  1great], and the ones towards  Antilebanon, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Gergashites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites)

2. that they came together to the same place to wage war against Joshua and Israel all together.

3. And the ones dwelling in Gibeon heard all as much as Joshua did  to Jericho and  to Ai.

4. And they acted, even indeed themselves with astuteness. And coming, they stood by and prepared. And taking [2sackcloths 1old] upon  their donkeys, and [2leather bags 3of wine 1old]  being broken down and all tied up,

5. and the hollows  in their shoes, and  their sandals old and mended on  their feet, and  their garments being old upon them, and the bread loaves  of their provisions [2dry 1were] and moldy and worm eaten,

6. that they came to Joshua into the camp of Israel in Gilgal. And they said to Joshua, and to all Israel, From out of a land far off we have come, and now ordain with us a covenant!

7. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the Hivites, Look, [2not 4with 5me 1you do 3dwell together], so how do we ordain with you a covenant?

8. And they said to Joshua, [2your servants 1We are]. And [2said 3to 4them 1Joshua], From what place are you, and from what place do you come?

9. And they said to him, [3from out of 4a land 5far off 6exceedingly 2have come  1your servants] in the name of the lord  your God. For we have heard  his name, and all as much as he did in Egypt;

10. and all as much as he did to the two kings of the Amorites, to the ones who were on the other side of the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth and in Edrain.

11. And [2spoke 3to 4us  1our elders], and all the ones dwelling in our land, saying, Take for yourselves provisions for the journey, and go to meet with them! And you shall say to them, [2your servants 1We are], and now ordain with us the covenant!

12. These are  our bread loaves we took hot, being provided of them from our houses in the day in which we came forth to come to you. And now behold, they are dry, and have become worm eaten.

13. And these are the leather bags for the wine which we filled new, And these are torn. And these are  our garments made old from the [2long 3journey 1exceedingly].

14. And [3took 1the 2rulers]  their provisions, and the mouth of the lord they did not ask. 

15.  Joshua Ordains a Covenant with Gibeon And [2made 4with 5them 1Joshua 3peace], and ordained with them a covenant, and [5swore by an oath 6to them 1the 2rulers 3of the 4congregation].

16. And it came to pass after three days, after the ordaining with them a covenant, they heard that [2near 1they are] them, and that [2among 3them 1they dwelt].

17. And [4departed 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and came forth into  their cities the [2day  1third]. And their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and cities of Jearim.

18. And [4did not 5wage war 6with them 1the 2sons 3of Israel], for [6swore by an oath 7to them 1all 2the 3rulers 4of the 5congregation] by the lord  God of Israel. And [4complained 1all 2the 3congregation] about the rulers.

19. And [4said 1all 2the 3rulers] to all the congregation, We swore by an oath to them by the lord  God of Israel. And now, we shall not be able to touch them.

20. This we will do to them -- to take them alive, and we will preserve them, and there will not be [2against 3us 1anger] on account of the oath which we swore by an oath to them.

21. And [3said 4to them 1the 2rulers], They shall live, and they shall be woodcutters and water-carriers to all the congregation, just as [3said 4to them 1the 2rulers].

22. And [2called them together 1Joshua], and he spoke to them, saying, Why did you mislead me, saying, [3far 1We are 4from 5you 2exceedingly]; but you are natives of the ones dwelling among us?

23. And now you are accursed, in no way shall there fail from one of you being a servant, nor woodcutter, nor a water-carrier to me, and to my God.

24. And they answered  Joshua, saying that, A message was announced to us as much as [3ordered 1the lord  2your God] Moses  his servant to give to you this  land, and to utterly destroy us, and all the ones dwelling upon it, from in front of you. And we feared exceedingly for  our lives from your presence, and we did  this thing.

25. And now, behold, we are under your hands as it pleases you. And as it seems good to do to us, you do it!

26. And they did to them thus, and [2rescued 3them 1Joshua] in  that day from the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not do away with them.

27. And [2established 3them 1Joshua] in  that day as woodcutters and water-carriers to all the congregation, and for the altar  of God until the day today, and for the place which ever he should choose.  

## Joshua 10

1.  Five Kings Attack And as [4heard 1Adoni-zedec 2the king 3of Jerusalem] that Joshua took  Ai, and utterly destroyed it, in which manner he did  to Jericho and  her king, and thus they did also  to Ai and  her king, and that [4deserted 1the ones 2dwelling 3in Gibeon] to Joshua and to Israel, and were in the midst of them;

2. that they feared among themselves exceedingly. For he knew that  [4city 2was 3a great 1Gibeon], as also one of the mother-cities of the kings, for it was great, over  Ai, and all  its men were strong.

3. And [4sent 1Adoni-zedec 2king 3of Jerusalem] to Holam king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,

4. Come, ascend to me, and help me! and we shall wage war against  Gibeon. For it deserted to Joshua, and to the sons of Israel!

5. And they gathered and ascended -- the five kings of the Amorites -- the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, they and all  their people; and they besieged  Gibeon and attempted to capture it.

6. And [4sent 1the 2ones dwelling 3in Gibeon] to Joshua into the camp of Israel in Gilgal, saying, Do not loosen  your hands from  your servants! Ascend to us  quickly and rescue us, and help us! for [6are gathering 7against 8us 1all 2the 3kings 4of the 5Amorites], the ones dwelling in the mountainous area.

7. And Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and every  warrior with him, all mighty in strength.

8. And the lord said to Joshua, Do not fear them! for into  your hands I have delivered them; there shall not stand even one of them before you. 

9.  Joshua Defeats the Five Kings And when [2came 3upon 4them 1Joshua] suddenly, for the entire  night he was gone from out of Gilgal,

10. that [2startled 3them 1the lord] from in front of Israel, and [2defeated 3them 1the lord 5defeat 4with a great] in Gibeon. And they pursued them by the way ascending to Beth-horon, and they slew them unto Azekah and unto Makkedah.

11. But in  their fleeing from in front of the sons of Israel at the descent of Beth-horon, that the lord cast upon them stones of hail from out of the heaven unto Azekah. And there were more  dying by the stones  of hail than which were killed  by the sons of Israel by sword in the battle. 

12.  The Sun and Moon Stand over Gibeon Then Joshua spoke to the lord in the day God delivered up the Amorites under the hand of the sons of Israel. And Joshua said, [2the 3sun 5over 6Gibeon 1Let 4stand], and the moon over the ravine of Ajalon.

13. And [6stood 1the 2sun 3and 4the 5moon] in position until God repulsed  their enemies. Is this not written in the scroll of the upright? And [3stood 1the 2sun] in the midst of the heaven, it did not go forth into descent for the completion [2day 1of one].

14. And there was not [2a day 1such] nor  former nor  latter, so as for God to heed the voice of man, because the lord joined in war with  Israel.

15. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him to the camp in Gilgal.

16. And [4fled  2five 3kings 1these] and hid in the cave -- the one in Makkedah.

17. And it was reported  to Joshua, saying, [4have been found 1The 2five 3kings] hiding in the cave, the one in Makkedah.

18. And Joshua said, Roll [2stones 1great] upon the mouth of the cave, and place upon them men  to guard  them!

19. But you do not stand firmly! be pursuing after  your enemies, and overtake  their rear guard, and do not let them enter into  their cities! [4delivered 1for 5them 2the lord  3our God] into  our hands.

20. And it came to pass as Joshua rested, and the son of Israel, in beating them [3slaughter 2great 1with an exceedingly] even unto completion, that the ones surviving were delivered from them, and entered into the [2cities  1fortified].

21. And [4returned 1all 2the 3people] to Joshua in Makkedah in the camp in health; and not [5growled 2of the 3sons 4of Israel 1one]  with his tongue.

22. And Joshua said, Open the cave, and lead out to me  [2five 3kings 1these] from out of the cave!

23. And they did thus, and they led to him  [2five 3kings 1these] out of the cave -- the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jarmuth, and the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

24. And when they led them to Joshua, then Joshua called together every man of Israel, saying to them, and the ones commencing the war of the ones going with him, saying to them, Go forth and place  your feet upon  their necks! And coming forward, they placed  their feet upon  their necks.

25. And [2said 3to 4them 1Joshua], You should not fear them nor be timid; be manly and be strong! for thus the lord shall do to all  your enemies whom you make war against them.

26. And [4killed 5them 3Joshua 1after 2this], and put them to death, and hung them upon five trees. And they were hanging upon the trees until evening.

27. And it came to pass towards the descent of the sun, and Joshua gave charge, and they lowered them from the trees. And they tossed them into the cave into which they took refuge there. And they rolled [2stones 1great] upon the cave, which remains until the day today.

28. And  [3Makkedah 2took 1Joshua] in  that day, and he slaughtered it by the mouth of the sword, and the king. And they utterly destroyed them, and every one breathing that was in it. And there was not left behind in it any one surviving. And they did to the king of Makkedah in which manner they did to the king of Jericho. 

29.  The Conquests of Joshua And Joshua went forth, and all Israel with him, from out of Makkedah unto Libna. And they assaulted against Libna.

30. And the lord delivered it also into the hand of Israel. And they took it, and  its king. And they slaughtered it by the mouth of the sword, and every one breathing that was in it; there was not left behind in her not even one surviving and having escaped. And they did to its king in which manner they did to the king of Jericho.

31. And Joshua went forth, and all Israel with him, from out of Libna unto Lachish; and he besieged it, and assaulted it.

32. And the lord delivered  Lachish into the hands of Israel. And he took it on the second day, and he slaughtered it by the mouth of the sword, and utterly destroyed it in which manner he did  to Libna.

33. Then [4ascended 1Horam 2king 3of Gezer] to help  Lachish. And [2struck 3him 1Joshua] by the mouth of the sword, and  his people, until there was not being left behind of them one being delivered and escaping.

34. And Joshua went forth, and all Israel with him, from Lachish unto Eglon, and he besieged it, and captured it.

35. And [2delivered 3it 1the lord] into the hand of Israel. And he took it in  that day, and he slaughtered it by the mouth of the sword, and every one breathing in it. In  that day they slaughtered in which manner they did  to Lachish.

36. And Joshua went forth, and all Israel with him, from Eglon unto Hebron. And they besieged it.

37. And they overtook it, and struck it by the mouth of the sword, and  its king, and  all its villages, and every one  breathing, as many as was in it. There was not one surviving. In which manner they did to Eglon, also they utterly destroyed it and all breathing, as much as was in it.

38. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and they besieged it.

39. And and they took it, and  its king, and all  her towns; and they struck it by the mouth of the sword, and they utterly destroyed it, and every one breathing in it, and they did not leave behind one surviving. In which manner they did  to Hebron, so they did  to Dabir, and to its king; just as he did  to Libna and  its king.

40. And Joshua struck  all the land of the mountainous area, and the Negev, and the plain, and  Asedoth, and  all its kings; they did not leave behind in it one being delivered, and every one breathing life they utterly destroyed; in which manner [4gave charge 1the lord  2God 3of Israel].

41. And [2killed 3them 1Joshua] from Kadesh Barnea unto Gaza, all the land of Goshen unto  Gibeon.

42. And all  these kings and  their land Joshua took at once; for the lord  God of Israel joined in war with  Israel.

43. And Joshua returned to Gilgal.  

## Joshua 11

1.  Hazor Wages War against Israel And when [4heard 1Jabin 2king 3of Hazor], he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to king Shimron, and to king Achshaph,

2. and to the kings of the places by [3Sidon 1the 2great], unto the mountainous area, and unto the wilderness before Chinneroth, and the plain, and unto Napedor,

3. and to the ones on the coast -- the Canaanites from the east, and to the ones on the coast -- the Amorites, and the Hittites, and Perizzites, and Jebusites, the ones in the mountain, and the Hivites under Hermon unto the land of Mizpeh.

4. And they came forth, they and  their kings with them, [2people 1a vast] as the sand which is by the edge of the sea  in multitude, and horses, and [3chariots 2many 1very].

5. And [3united 1all  2these kings], and came and camped together by the water of Merom to wage war against Israel.

6. And the lord said to Joshua, You should not fear from their face, for tomorrow  at this hour I will deliver all of them being putting to flight before the sons Israel.  Their horses you shall hamstring, and  their chariots you shall incinerate by fire.

7. And Joshua came, and all the [2people  1warrior] with him, against them at the water of Merom, suddenly. And they fell against them in the mountainous area.

8. And [2delivered 3them 1the lord] under the hands of Israel. And beating them they pursued them unto [3Sidon 1the 2great], and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the plains of Mizpeh and eastwards. And they slew them until the not being left behind of them one surviving.

9. And [2did 3to them  1Joshua] in so far as [2gave charge 3to him 1the lord].  [2their horses 1He hamstrung], and  [2their chariots 1he burned] by fire.

10. And Joshua returned in  that time, and overtook  Hazor; and  her king he killed by the broadsword. [3was 1And 2Hazor]  formerly ruling all  these kingdoms.

11. And he killed everyone breathing in it by the mouth of the sword, and he utterly destroyed all, and there was not left behind in it one breathing. And  Hazor they burned by fire.

12. And all the cities  of these kingdoms, and all  their kings, Joshua took and did away with them by the mouth of the sword. And he utterly destroyed them in which manner [5ordered 1Moses 2the 3servant 4of the lord].

13. But all the cities  being fortified by a mound of them [2did not 3burn 1Israel]. Except  [3Hazor 4only 2burned 1Joshua].

14. And all  her spoils, and the cattle, [4despoiled 5for themselves 1the 2sons 3of Israel]. [3of them 1And 2all] they utterly destroyed by the mouth of the sword; and he destroyed them, they did not leave behind of them one breathing.

15. In which manner the lord gave orders  to Moses, to his servant, likewise Moses gave charge  to Joshua, and thus Joshua did; he did not violate anything of all which [2gave orders 3to him 1Moses]. 

16.  Further Conquests of Joshua And Joshua took all  this land -- the mountainous area, and the whole land of Negev, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the land towards the west, and the mountain of Israel, and the low lands, the ones towards the mountain;

17. from mount Halak, and the ascent into Seir, and unto Baal-gad, and the plain  of Lebanon under  mount  Hermon. And [2all  3their kings 1he took], and he did away with them, and killed them.

18. And [2days 1for many] Joshua made [2against 3all  4these kings  1war].

19. And there was not a city which he did not deliver over to the sons of Israel, except the Hivite  dwelling in Gibeon. He took all by war.

20. For it was by the lord to become strong  of their heart to meet for war against Israel, that they should be utterly destroyed; so that no [2should be given 3to them 1mercy], but that they should be utterly destroyed in which manner the lord told to Moses.

21. And Joshua came in  that time and utterly destroyed the Anakim from out of the mountainous area, from Hebron and from Debir, and from Anab, and from every mountain of Judah, and from every mountain of Israel with  their cities. And [2utterly destroyed 3them 1Joshua].

22. He did not leave of the Anakim from the sons of Israel, but except for in Gaza, and in Gath, and in Ashdod, some were left.

23. And Joshua took all the land, as far as the lord gave charge  to Moses. And [2gave 3them 1Joshua] by inheritance to Israel in their distribution according to their tribes. And the land rested from waging war.  

## Joshua 12

1.  Israel Inherits the Land And these are the kings of the land which [4did away with 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and inherited  their land on the other side of the Jordan, of the east sun of the ravine of Arnon unto  mount Hermon, and all  Araba of the east --

2.  Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, dominating from Aroer, which is by the river bank in the ravine of Arnon, in the midst of the ravine, and the half  of Gilead, unto Jabbok the rushing stream, the borders of the sons of Ammon.

3. And  Araba unto the sea of Chinneroth according to the east, and unto the sea of Araba, the sea  of salts from the east, by the way  according to Beth-jeshimoth; and from Teman, the one under Ashdoth Pisgah.

2. According to lots they inherited, in which manner the lord gave charge by the hand of Moses, to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.

3. [3gave 1for 2Moses] a lot to the two tribes and to the half tribe of the other side of the Jordan. And to the Levites [2was not given 1a lot] among them.

4. For [4were 1the 2sons 3of Joseph] two tribes -- Manasseh and Ephraim. And [2was not 3given 1a portion] to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, and  their outskirts  for their cattle and  their herds.

5. In which manner the lord gave charge  to Moses, so [4did 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and they portioned the land.

6. And there came forward sons of Judah to Joshua in Gilgal. And said to him Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, You know the word which the lord spoke to Moses the man  of God concerning me and you in Kadesh Barnea.

7. [3forty 1For 4years old 2I was] when [5sent 6me 1Moses 2the 3servant  4of God] from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. And I answered him a word according to  his mind.

8. But my brethren the ones ascending with me changed over the mind of the people. But I proceeded to follow after the lord  my God.

9. And Moses swore by an oath in  that day, saying that, The land upon which you mounted in it will be yours by lot, and to your children into the eon, for you proceeded to follow after the lord  my God.

10. And now, [2maintained 3me 1the lord] in which manner he said this fortieth and fifth year, from which the lord spoke  this word to Moses; and Israel went in the wilderness. And now behold, I am today a son eighty and five years old.

11. Yet I am today of strength as when [2sent 3me 1Moses], likewise I am strong now [4for  5war 1to go forth 2and 3to enter].

12. And now I ask you  this mountain as the lord said  in that day, for you heard  this word in  that day, saying, And now the Anakim are there, in cities great and fortified. If then the lord [2with 3me 1should be], I shall utterly destroy them in which manner [2spoke 3to me 1the lord].

13. And [2blessed 3him 1Joshua], and he gave  Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh by lot.

14. On account of this Hebron came  to Caleb, to the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite by lot until  today's day, because  he followed after the order of the lord  God of Israel.

15. And the name  of Hebron  formerly was City Arbai, [2is the mother-city 3of the 4Anakim 1this]. Then the land abated  of war.

14. And [4utterly destroyed 5from there 1Caleb 2son 3of Jephunneh] the three sons of Anak --  Sheshai, and Ahiman, and  Talmai, offspring of the Anak.

15. And [2ascended 3from there 1Caleb] upon the ones dwelling in Debir; and the name Debir was  formerly City of Letters.

16. And Caleb said, Who ever should take the City  of Letters, and should dominate it, I will give to him  Achsah my daughter for a wife.

17. And [8took 9it 1Othniel 2son 3of Kenaz 4the 6brother 7of Caleb  5younger]. And he gave to him Achsah his daughter to him for a wife.

18. And it came to pass in  her going forth, that she advised him, saying, I will ask  my father for a field; and she yelled from the donkey. And Caleb said, What is it with you?

19. And she said to him, Give a blessing to me! for [3for 4the land 5of the Negev 1you have appointed 2me]. Give to me  Golath-maim. And [2gave 3her 1Caleb]  Golath-maim the upper part, and  Golath the part below.

18. For the forest shall be to you, for [2a forest 1it is], and you shall clear it out. And [2will be 3to you  1his departure] whenever you should utterly destroy the Canaanite, for [3cavalry 2a choice 1there is] to him, for he is strong; for you excel in strength over him.

4. Give from out of yours three men from a tribe, and send them; and rising up let them go through the land, and let them diagram it before me! as it shall behoove to divide it. And they came to him. 

5.  The Land Divided into Seven Portions And he divided to them seven portions -- Judah shall stand as a border from the south to them, and the sons of Joseph shall stand upon  their border from the north.

6. And you portion the land into seven portions, and bring the diagram to me here! and I shall bring forth to you a lot here before the lord  your God.

8. And rising up the men went. And Joshua gave charge to the men  going to explore the land, saying, Spread, and go through the land, and explore it, and come to me! and I will bring forth to you here a lot before the lord in Shiloh.

9. And [3went 1the 2men] and spread in the land, and explored it. And they beheld it, and they wrote about it according to her cities, seven portions in a scroll, and they brought it to Joshua in the camp in Shiloh.

10. And [2cast 3for them 1Joshua] a lot in Shiloh before the lord.

## Joshua 22

1.  Joshua Charges Israel to Guard the Commandments Then Joshua called together the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

2. And he said to them, You have heard the whole, as much as [5gave charge 6to you 1Moses 2the 3servant 4of the lord], and you heeded  my voice according to all as much as I gave charge to you.

3. And you have not abandoned  your brethren these  [2days  1many]; until the day  of today you guarded the commandment of the lord  our God.

4. And now [3rested 1the lord  2our God]  our brethren in which manner he spoke to them. Now then in returning you go forth to  your houses, and to the land  of your possession which [4gave 5to you 1Moses 2the bondman 3of the lord] on the other side of the Jordan.

5. But guard exceedingly to do the commandments and the law, which [5gave charge 6to you 1Moses 2the 3servant 4of the lord] -- to love the lord  your God, and to go by all  his ways, to guard  his commandments, and to lie near to them, and to serve him in all  your thought, and of [2entire  3soul 1your].

6. And [2blessed 3them 1Joshua], and sent them, and they went unto  their houses.

7. And to the halves of the tribe Moses gave a portion in the Bashan area; and to the halves Joshua gave a portion with  his brethren on the other side of the Jordan towards the west. And when [2sent 3them 1Joshua] unto  their houses, then he blessed them saying,

8. With [2things 1many] they went forth unto  their houses, and with [3cattle 2much 1exceedingly], and silver, and gold, and brass, and iron tools, and clothes [2much 1exceedingly]; and they divided the spoils  of their enemies with  their brethren.

9. And [4returned 5and 6went 1the 2sons 3of Reuben], and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh from the sons of Israel from Shiloh in the land of Canaan, to go forth into  land of Gilead, into the land of their possession which they inherited it, through the order of the lord by the hand of Moses. 

10.  The Shrine at Gilead And they came into Galeloth  of Jordan, which is in the land of Canaan; and they built (the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh) there a shrine upon the Jordan; [2shrine 1a great]  to behold.

11. And [4heard 1the 2sons 3of Israel], saying, Behold, they built (the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh) a shrine upon the border of the land of Canaan, at  Gilead  of Jordan, on the other side of the sons of Israel.

12. And [4heard 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and [5gathered together 1all 2the 3sons 4of Israel] in Shiloh, for their ascending to wage war.

13. And [4sent 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead,  both Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest,

14. and ten of the rulers of the ones with him; [2ruler 1one] from a house of family, from all of the tribes of Israel, men rulers of the houses of the families -- they are commanders of thousands in Israel.

15. And they came to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the halves of the tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead; and they spoke to them, saying,

16. Thus says all the congregation of the lord, What  is this trespass which you trespass before the God of Israel, to turn away today from behind the lord by building for yourselves a shrine, [3defectors 2to become 1for you] today from the lord?

17. Is it a small thing to you, the sin of Peor, that we were not cleansed from it unto  this day, and there became the calamity in the congregation of the lord?

18. And you were turned away today from the lord, and tomorrow [3upon 4all 5Israel 1there will be 2anger].

19. And now, if [4be small 1the 2land  3of your possession], pass over into the land of the possession of the lord! where [4encamps 5there 1the 2tent 3of the lord]; and inherit among us, and [4from 5the lord 2not 3defectors 1be]! and [3from 4us 1do not 2separate]! on account of  your building a shrine outside the altar of the lord  our God.

20. Behold did not Achan the son of Zara [2a trespass 1trespass] from the offering for consumption, and upon all the congregation became anger? And this one only sinned, but not this one alone died for  his sin.

21. And they answered (the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh,) and said to the commanders of thousands of Israel, saying,

22. God, the [3God 1 lord 2is]. And  God,  the lord God himself knows, and Israel itself shall know; if [2by 3defection 1we trespassed] before the lord, may he not rescue us in  this day.

23. And if we built [2for ourselves 1a shrine], so as to depart from the lord, or so as to haul up on it a sacrifice of whole burnt-offerings, or so as to make upon it a sacrifice of deliverance, the lord himself shall inquire.

24. But [4because of 5veneration 3thing 1we did 2this], saying that, Should tomorrow [2say  1your children] to our children, saying, What is it to you and to the lord  God of Israel?

25. And [2a border 1the lord put] between us and you, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad -- the Jordan; and there is no [2to you 1portion] of the lord. And [2shall separate  1your sons]  from our sons, that they should not worship the lord.

26. And we said to do thus,  to build  this shrine, not because of yield offerings, nor because of sacrifices,

27. but that [2might be 1this testimony] between us and between you, and between  our generations after us,  to serve the service of the lord before him in  our yield offerings, and in  our sacrifices, and in the sacrifices  of our deliverances; and so that [2shall not say  1your children] tomorrow to our children, There is no portion to you of the lord.

28. And we said, If it comes to pass at some time or other, and they shall speak to us or to our generations tomorrow, then we shall say, Behold! it is a representation of the altar of the lord which [2made  1our fathers]. It is not for yield offerings, nor for sacrifices, but it is a testimony between you, and between us, and between  our sons.

29. May it not be then for us to leave from the lord, so as to turn away in  today's days from the lord, so as to build us an altar for the yield offerings, and the sacrifices, and the sacrifice  of deliverance, except for the altar of the lord  our God which is before  his tent.

30. And [4heard 1Phinehas 2the 3priest], and all the rulers of the congregation, and the commanders of Israel, the ones who were with him, the words which they spoke, the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh, and it pleased them.

31. And [6said 1Phinehas 2son 3of Eleazar 4the 5priest] to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Manasseh, Today we know that [2is with 3us 1the lord], for you did not trespass before the lord this trespass, and that you rescued the sons of Israel from out of the hand of the lord.

32. And [9returned 1Phinehas 2son 3of Eleazar 4the 5priest 6and 7the 8rulers] from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, from out of  Gilead unto the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel; and they answered to them with these words.

33. And [3was pleasing 1the 2word] to the sons of Israel; and they blessed the God of the sons of Israel. And no longer they spoke to ascend to them for war, to utterly destroy the land of the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad which they dwelt upon it.

34. And he named  [3for Reuben 4and  5for Gad 1the 2shrine]. And they said that, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the lord he [2their God 1is].  

## Joshua 23

1.  Joshua Calls Together the Sons of Israel And it came to pass after [2days 1many], after  [3rested 1the lord  2God] Israel from all  their enemies round about, and Joshua was older being advanced  in days,

2. that Joshua called together all the sons of Israel, and  their council of elders, and  their rulers, and  their magistrates, and  their scribes, and he said to them, I grow old and advanced  in days.

3. And you have seen all things as much as [3did 1the lord  2our God] to all  these nations from in front of you; for the lord  our God, he is the one waging war for you.

4. Behold whatsoever I said, I cast to you nations, the ones being left to you. These lands will be for  lots to  your tribes. [4from 5the 6Jordan 1All 2the 3nations] I utterly destroyed, and from the [2sea  1great] you shall define the bounds by the descent of the sun.

5. And the lord  your God, he shall utterly destroy them from in front of you, and he shall utterly destroy them from your face; and you shall inherit  their land, as [3spoke 1the lord  2your God] to you.

6. Grow strong then exceedingly! to guard and to do all things  being written in the scroll of the law of Moses, that you should not turn aside from him to the right or to the left;

7. that you should not enter unto  [2nations  3being left 1these] with you, and the names  of their gods you shall not name among you, and you shall not swear by an oath nor serve, nor shall you do obeisance to them.

8. But to the lord  your God you shall cleave, just as you did until  this day.

9. And [2shall utterly destroy 3them 1the lord] from your face -- [4nations 1great 2and 3strong]; and to you no one withstood before you until  this day.

10. [2man 1One] of you pursued a thousand. For the lord  our God, he wages war for you, just as he spoke to you.

11. But guard exceedingly  your lives!  to love the lord  your God.

12. For if you should turn away, and should proceed  to leave behind these nations with you, and [2connections by marriage 1you should make] with them, and mix together with them, and they with you.

13. With knowledge know that in no way shall [3proceed 1the lord  2your God]  to utterly destroy  these nations from your face. And they will be to you for snares, and for obstacles, and for nails in  your heels, and for arrows in  your eyes, until whenever you should destroy them from  [2land  1this good] which [3gave 4to you 1the lord  2your God].

14. But I run today the way as also all the ones upon the earth. And you shall know in [2whole  3heart 1your], and in [2whole  3soul 1your], that [3failed not 2word 1one] from all of the [2words  1good] of which [3spoke 1the lord  2your God] concerning you; all the things being related to us -- he did not dissent from them [2word 1one].

15. And it will be in which manner [5come 6unto 7you 1all 2the 4things  3good], which [3spoke 1the lord  2your God] unto you; so the lord will bring upon you all the [2things  1bad], until he should utterly destroy you from  [2land  1this good], of which [3gave 4to you 1the lord  2your God],

16. in  your violating the covenant of the lord  your God, which he gave charge to you, and going you shall serve [2gods 1other], and shall do obeisance to them, and [2shall be provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] with you, and you shall perish  quickly from the [2land  1good] which [2gave 3to you 1the lord].  

## Joshua 24

1.  The History of Israel's Sojourn And Joshua brought together all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and he called together the elders of Israel, and  their rulers, and  their magistrates, and  their scribes; and they stood before  God.

2. And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, On the other side of the river [2dwelled  1your fathers] from the beginning -- Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor; and they served [2gods 1other].

3. And I took  your father  Abraham from out of the other side of the river, and I guided him in all the land of Canaan, and I multiplied  his seed.

4. And I gave to him  Isaac; and I gave to Isaac  Jacob and  Esau; and I gave to Esau  mount  Seir, for an inheritance to him; and Jacob and  his sons went down into Egypt.

5. And I sent Moses and Aaron, and he struck  Egypt with the things which he did among them.

6. And after these things he led you, and he led  your fathers from out of Egypt. And you entered into the sea, and [3pursued 1the 2Egyptians] after  your fathers with chariots and with horses into the [2sea  1red].

7. And we yelled to the lord, and he put a cloud and dimness between you and between the Egyptians; and he brought upon them the sea, and it covered them; and [2beheld  1your eyes] as much as the lord did in the land of Egypt; and you were in the wilderness [2days 1many].

8. And he led you into the land of the Amorites  dwelling on the other side of the Jordan; and they deployed against you. And [2delivered 3them 1the lord] into  your hands, and you inherited  their land, and you utterly destroyed them from your face.

9. And Balak rose up, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, and deployed against Israel. And sending, he called  Balaam son of Beor to curse you.

10. And [3did not 4want 1the lord  2your God] to destroy you, and with blessings he blessed you, and rescued you from their hands.

11. And you passed over the Jordan and came to Jericho; and [4waged war 5against 6you 1the ones 2dwelling 3in Jericho], the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and he delivered them into  your hands.

12. And he sent [3in front 4of you 1the 2swarm of wasps], and it cast them out from your presence -- the two kings of the Amorites; but not by  your broadsword, nor by  your bow.

13. And he gave to you the land upon which you did not tire by labor upon; and he gave cities which you did not build, but you settled upon them; and he gave vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant, but you shall eat from them. 

14.  Choose Whom You Will Serve And now fear the lord, and serve him in straightness and in righteousness, and remove the [2gods  1alien] which [2served  1your fathers] on the other side of the river, and in Egypt, and serve to the lord!

15. But if it is not pleasing to you to serve to the lord, choose to yourselves today whom you should serve! whether to the gods  of your fathers, to the ones on the other side of the river, or whether to the gods of the Amorites, in which you dwell upon  their land. But I and  my house, will serve to the lord!

16. And responding the people said, May it not be to us to leave the lord so as to serve [2gods 1other].

17. The lord  our God, he led us and  our fathers from out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and as many as [3he did 4to us  2signs  1these great], and guarded us in all the way which we went by it, and among all the nations which we went through them.

18. And the lord cast out all the nations, and the Amorite  dwelling in the land, from our face. But also we will serve to the lord, for this one is  our God.

19. And Joshua said to all the people, In no way shall you be able to serve to the lord (for he is holy, and God is jealous, this one shall not spare  your violations of the law, and  your sins)

20. when ever you should abandon the lord, and should serve [2gods 1alien]. And coming he shall afflict you, and shall completely consume you, because [2good 1he did] to you.

21. And [3said 1the 2people] to Joshua, No, but to the lord we shall serve.

22. And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses according to yourselves that [3chose 1you 2yourselves] the lord, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.

23. And now, remove the [2gods  1alien], the ones among you, and straighten the heart to the lord God of Israel!

24. And [3said 1the 2people] to Joshua, To the lord  our God we shall serve, and  of his voice we shall hearken. 

25.  Joshua Ordains a Covenant with Israel And Joshua ordained a covenant with the people in  that day. And he gave to them the law and judgment in Shechem.

26. And Joshua wrote  these things in a scroll of the law  of God. And [2took 4stone 3a great 5and 6set 7it 1Joshua] there under the terebinth tree  before the lord.

27. And Joshua said to all the people, Behold,  this stone will be to you for a testimony; for it has heard all the things being said by the lord, as much as he spoke to you today. And this will be in you for a testimony unto the last of the days, when ever you should lie to the lord  your God.

28. And Joshua sent the people each to  his place. 

29.  Joshua Dies And it came to pass after those things [4died 1Joshua 2the son 3of Nun], a servant of the lord who was a hundred ten years old.

30. And they entombed him by the borders  of his inheritance in Timmnath-serah, in  mount  Ephraim, from the north of the mountain of Gaash.

31. And Israel served to the lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders, as many as dragged on  in time after Joshua, and as many as beheld all the works of the lord, as much as he did  to Israel.

32. And [5the 6bones 7of Joseph 4took up 1the 2sons 3of Israel] from out of Egypt, and they buried them in Shechem, in the portion of the field of which Jacob acquired from the Amorites  dwelling in Shechem for a hundred ewe-lambs, and he gave it  to Joseph for a portion.

33. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the chief priest came to an end; and he was entombed in Gabath of Phinehas  his son, which he gave to him in  mount Ephraim.
