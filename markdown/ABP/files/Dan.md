## Daniel 1

1.  The Sons of the Captivity in Babylon In the [2year 1third] of the kingdom of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and assaulted it.

2. And the lord gave into his hand  Jehoiakim king of Judah, and from part of the items of the house of the lord. And he brought them into the land of Shinar of the house  of his god. And the items he carried into the house of the treasury  of his god.

3. And [3told 1the 2king]  Ashpenaz  his chief eunuch to bring in some from the sons of the captivity of Israel, and from the seed  of royalty, and from the nobles;

4. young men to whom there is no [2upon 3them 1blemish], and good to the appearance, and perceiving in all wisdom, and knowing knowledge, and considering in intelligence, and ones in whom there is strength in them to stand in the house before the king,  to teach them letters and the language of the Chaldeans.

5. And [3set in order 4to them 1the 2king]   day by day from the table of the king, and from the wine  of his banquet; and to maintain them [2years 1for three], and after these things to stand them before the king. 

6.  The Four Sons of Judah Tested And there existed among them from out of the sons of Judah, Daniel, and Hananiah, and Mishael, and Azariah.

7. And [3added 5to them 1the 2chief eunuch 4names]; to Daniel -- Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah -- Shadrach, and to Mishael -- Meshach, and to Azariah -- Abed-nego.

8. And Daniel put unto  his heart so as in no way he should be polluted in the table of the king, and in the wine  of his banquet. And he petitioned the chief eunuch so that in no way he should be polluted.

9. And God granted  Daniel for mercy and compassion before the chief eunuch.

10. And [3said 1the 2chief eunuch] to Daniel, I fear  my lord the king, the one arraying  your food and  your drink, lest at any time he should behold  your faces looking downcast more than the boys, the ones of your contemporaries; and you should condemn  my head to the king.

11. And Daniel said to Melzar, whom [3placed 1the 2chief eunuch] over Daniel, and Hananiah, and Mishael, and Azariah.

12. Test now indeed  your servants [2days 1ten]; and let there be given to us from food of the seeds of the earth! and we shall eat of it, and water we shall drink.

13. And let [2be seen 3before 4you  1our shape]! and the shapes of the boys of the ones eating at the table of the king. And how ever you should behold, do accordingly with  your servants!

14. And he hearkened to them, and he tested them [2days 1ten].

15. And after the end of the ten days [2looked  1their shape] good and strong  in flesh above all the boys  eating at the table of the king.

16. And it came to pass Melzar did away with  their supper and the wine  for their drink, and he gave to them food of the seeds.

17. And [2gave 3to them  1God] understanding and intelligence in all academics, and wisdom. And Daniel perceived in every vision and in dreams. 

18.  Daniel Stands before the King And after the end of the days which [3told 1the 2king] to bring them in, that [3brought them in 1the 2chief eunuch] before Nebuchadnezzar.

19. And [3spoke 4with 5them 1the 2king]; and there was not found from out of all of them one likened to Daniel, and Hananiah, and Mishael, and Azariah; and they stood before the king.

20. And in every discourse of wisdom and higher knowledge, as much as [3sought 4from 5them 1the 2king], he found them ten-times more than all of the enchanters, and the magi, the ones being in all  of his kingdom.

21. And Daniel existed until year one of Cyrus the king.  

## Daniel 2

1.  Nebuchadnezzar's Dream In the [2year  1second] of the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar, [2dreamed 1Nebuchadnezzar] a dream, and [2was startled  1his spirit], and  his sleep went from him.

2. And [3said 1the 2king] to call the enchanters, and the magi, and the administers of potions, and the Chaldeans,  to announce to the king the things of his dreams. And they came and stood before the king.

3. And [3said 4to them 1the 2king], I dreamed, and it startled  my spirit so as to know the dream.

4. And [3spoke 1the 2Chaldeans] to the king in Syriac, O king, [2into 3the 4eons 1live]! You tell the dream to your servants! and the interpretation of it we shall announce.

5. [3answered 1The 2king] and said to the Chaldeans, The matter [2from 3me 1departed]. If then you should not make known to me the dream and the interpretation of it, [2for 3destruction 1you will be], and  your houses shall be torn in pieces.

6. But if the dream and the interpretation of it you should make known to me, gifts and favors without charge, and [2honor 1much] you shall receive from me. Except the dream and the interpretation of it report to me!

7. They answered a second time and said, [2the 3king 1Let] tell the dream to his servants! and the interpretation of it we shall announce.

8. And [3answered 1the 2king] and said, In truth I know that [3time 1you 2buy back], even in so far as you knew that [3departed 4from 5me 1the 2word].

9. If then the dream you should not announce to me, I know that [4word 1a lying 2and 3corrupt] you agreed to speak before me until the time should go by.  [3my dream 1Tell 2to me]! and I shall know that also  its interpretation you shall announce to me.

10. Answered again the Chaldeans before the king, and they say, There is not a man upon the dry land who is able [2the 3discourse 4of the 5king 1to make known], in so far as every [2king 1great] and ruler [2matter 1according to such] asked not an enchanter, magus or Chaldean.

11. For the word which the king asks is heavy, and [2no other 1there is] who shall announce it before the king, except the gods, which are not  dwelling with any flesh. 

12.  The Wise Men Are Destroyed Then the king in rage and [2anger 1much], said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

13. And the decree went forth, that the wise men be killed; and they sought Daniel and  his friends to do away with.

14. Then Daniel answered counsel and opinion to Arioch the chief guard of the king, who came forth to do away with the wise men of Babylon.

15. And he inquired of him, saying, O Ruler of the king, for what reason came forth the decree which is impudent from in front of the king? [3made known 1And 4the 5saying 2Arioch]  to Daniel.

16. And Daniel entered and petitioned the king so as [2time 1to give] to him, and the interpretation of it he should announce to the king. 

17.  Daniel and His Friends Pray And Daniel went into  his house, and to Hananiah, and to Mishael, and to Azariah  his friends [2the 3saying 1to make known].

18. And [2compassions 1they sought] from the God  of heaven concerning  this mystery, so that therefore [4should not 5be destroyed 1Daniel 2and  3his friends] with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

19. Then [4to Daniel 5in 7vision 6a night 1the 2mystery 3was uncovered], and [2blessed 3the 4God  5of heaven 1Daniel].

20. And he said, May it be -- the name  of God being blessed from the eon and unto the eon, for the wisdom and the might are his.

21. And he changes seasons and times; he ordains kings, and changes; giving wisdom to the wise, and intelligence to the ones knowing understanding.

22. He uncovers deep and concealed things, knowing the things in the darkness, and the light [2with 3him 1is].

23. To you, O God  of my fathers, I acknowledge and praise, for wisdom and power you gave to me, and made known to me what we petitioned from you; and the matter of the king you made known to me.

24. And Daniel came to Arioch, whom [3appointed 1the 2king] to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, The wise men of Babylon you should not destroy, but bring me before the king, and the interpretation to the king I will announce. 

25.  Daniel Interprets the Dream Then Arioch in haste brought  Daniel before the king, and said to him, I found a man from out of the sons of the captivity  of Judea, one who [2the 3interpretation 4to the 5king 1will announce].

26. And [3answered 1the 2king] and said  to Daniel, of which the name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to announce to me the dream which I beheld, and the interpretation of it?

27. And Daniel answered before the king, and he said, The mystery which the king asks is not of wise men, magi, enchanters, astrologers, to announce to the king.

28. But there is a God in heaven uncovering mysteries, and he made known  to king Nebuchadnezzar what must take place at the last of the days. The dream of yours, and the visions  of your head upon  your bed, is this,

29. You, O king,  your thoughts upon  your bed ascended to what must take place after these things. And the one uncovering mysteries made known to you what must take place.

30. And to me there is not a wisdom  being in me more than all the living;  [2this mystery 3was uncovered 1but] because of the  interpretation [2to the 3king 1to be made known], that [2the 3thoughts  4of your heart 1you should know]. 

31.  The Great Image of Nebuchadnezzar's Dream You, O king, viewed. And behold, [3image 1one 2great].  [3image 1That 2great], and the aspect of it was overwhelming, standing before your face; and the vision of it was fearful.

32. An image of which the head was of [2gold 1pure], the hands and the breast and the arms of it silver, the belly and the thighs brass,

33. the legs iron, the feet part somewhat of iron, and part somewhat earthenware.

34. You viewed until [2was shredded 1a stone] from a mountain without hands, and it struck the image upon the feet  of iron and earthenware; and it thinned them out unto completion.

35. Then they were thinned out at once -- the potsherd, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold; and they became as a cloud of dust from the threshing-floor at harvest; and [5lifted them away 1the 2abundance 3of the 4wind], and no place was found for them; and the stone which struck the image became [2mountain 1a great], and it filled all the earth.

36. This is the dream; and the interpretation of it we will tell before the king.

37. You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God  of heaven [7kingdom 2a strong 3and 4fortified 5and 6honorable 1gave].

38. In every place where [4dwell 1the 2sons  3of men], both wild beasts of the field and birds of heaven he gave into  your hand, and he placed you lord of all. You are the head  of gold.

39. And after you shall arise [2kingdom 1another] inferior of you, and [2kingdom 1a third] which is the brass, which shall dominate over all the earth.

40. And [2kingdom 1a fourth] which shall be strong as iron, in which manner  iron makes fine and tames all things -- so it shall be made fine and be tamed.

41. And that which you beheld of the feet and of the toes, part somewhat earthenware, and part somewhat of iron, [2a kingdom 3divided 1will be]; and some from the root  of iron will be in it, in which manner you beheld the iron being intermingled with the potsherd.

42. And the toes of the feet, part somewhat of iron and part somewhat earthenware, part [4somewhat 1of the 2kingdom 3will be] strong, and some from it will be broken.

43. For you beheld the iron being intermingled with the potsherd; [2mixed together 1so they will be] with the seed of men. But they will not be cleaving, this one with this other one, as the iron does not intermingle with the potsherd.

44. And in the days  of those kings [4shall raise up 1the 2God  3of heaven] a kingdom, which [3into 4the 5eons 1shall not be 2corrupted]. And  his kingdom [4people 3to another 1shall not 2be left], but it shall thin and winnow all the kingdoms, and this one shall rise up into the eons.

45. In which manner you beheld that from a mountain [2was trimmed 1a stone] without hands, and it thinned the potsherd, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold; the great God made known to the king what must take place after these things. And [3is true 1the 2dream], and [4is trustworthy 1the 2interpretation 3of it]. 

46.  The King Honors Daniel and His God Then  king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and  did obeisance to Daniel, and [4of a gift offering 5and 6of a pleasant aroma offering 1said 2to offer a libation 3to him].

47. And responding the king said  to Daniel, In truth  your God, he is God of gods, and lord of the kings, and uncovering mysteries, for you were able to uncover  this mystery.

48. And [3magnified 1the 2king]  Daniel, and [6gifts 3great 4and 5many 1he gave 2to him], and he established him over all the places of Babylon, and ruler of satraps, over all the wise men of Babylon.

49. And Daniel asked of the king, and he placed over the works of the region of Babylon,  Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. And Daniel was in the courtyard of the king.  

## Daniel 3

1.  Dedication of the Image of Gold Nebuchadnezzar the king made [2image 1a gold]. Its height -- [2cubits 1sixty], its breadth -- [2cubits 1six], and he stationed it in the plain of Dura, in the region of Babylon.

2. And he sent to gather together the supreme leaders, and the commandants, and the toparchs, leaders, and sovereigns, and the ones in authorities, and all the rulers of the regions, to come unto the holidays of dedication of the image which [4stationed 1Nebuchadnezzar 2the 3king].

3. And gathered together the toparchs, supreme leaders, commandants, leaders, sovereigns, great ones, the ones in authorities, and all the rulers of the regions, to the dedication of the image which [4stationed 1Nebuchadnezzar 2the 3king]. And they stood before the image which Nebuchadnezzar stationed.

4. And the herald yelled in strength, To you it is spoken, O nations, peoples, tribes, languages,

5. in which ever hour you should hear a sound of a trumpet, even flute, and harp, even sambuke and psaltery, and every harmony of sound of kinds of music -- falling, you shall do obeisance to the image  of gold which [4stationed 1Nebuchadnezzar 2the 3king].

6. And who ever should not fall to do obeisance, in that same hour they shall be put into the [2furnace  3of fire  1burning].

7. And it came to pass when [3heard 1the 2peoples] the sound of the trumpet, even flute and harp, even sambuke and psaltery, and every kind of music, falling down the peoples, tribes, languages, did obeisance to the image  of gold which [4stationed 1Nebuchadnezzar 2the 3king].

8. Then [3came forward 2men 1Chaldean], and they accused the Jews. And undertaking, they said [3Nebuchadnezzar 1to 2king],

9. O king, [2into 3the 4eons 1live]!

10. You O king established a decree, Every man who ever should hear the sound of the trumpet, even flute and harp, even sambuke and psaltery, and harmony of sound, and every kind of music,

11. and should not fall to do obeisance to the image  in gold, shall be put into the [2furnace  3of fire  1burning]. 

12.  Three Jews Refuse to Bow There are men Jews whom you placed over the works of the region of Babylon -- Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego.  These men obeyed not, O king,  your decree, and  your gods they serve not, and to the image  of gold which you stationed they do not do obeisance to.

13. Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger said to lead in  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. And they led them before the king.

14. And Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, Is it truly, Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego, to my gods you serve not, and to the image  in gold which I stationed, you do not do obeisance to?

15. Now then if it suffices readily that as whenever you should hear the sound of the trumpet, also flute and harp, also sambuke and psaltery, and harmony of sound, and every kind of music, falling you should do obeisance to the image which I made -- good. And if you should not do obeisance this  hour, you shall be put into the [2furnace  3of fire  1burning]; and who is God who shall rescue you from out of  my hands?

16. And answered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, saying  to king Nebuchadnezzar, [3no 4need 2have 1We] concerning  this matter to answer to you.

17. [9is 1For 3God 2our 4in 5the heavens 6in whom 7we 8serve] able to rescue us from out of the [2furnace  3of fire  1burning]. And from out of  your hands, O king, he shall rescue us.

18. But if not, [2made known 1let it be] to you, O king! that  your gods we will not serve, and to the [2image  1golden] which you stationed, we will not do obeisance to.

19. Then  Nebuchadnezzar was filled of rage, and the appearance  of his face changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. And he said to burn the furnace seven-fold until which [2to 3the end 1it should burn].

20. And [3men 2strong 4of strength 1he told] shackling  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, to cast them into the [2furnace  3fire  1burning].

21. Then  those men were shackled with  their pantaloons, and tiaras, and leggings, and their garments. And they were thrown into the midst of the [2furnace  3of fire  1burning],

22. since the saying of the king excelled, and the furnace burned away over even extra seven-fold.

23. And  these three -- Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the [2furnace  3of fire  1burning], being shackled.

24. And Nebuchadnezzar heard their praising. And he wondered, and rose up in haste, and said to his great men, Was it not [2men 1three] we threw into the midst of the fire being shackled? And they said to the king, Truly, O king.

25. And [2said  1the king], Here, I see [2men 1four] being loose and walking in the midst of the fire, and [2no corruption 1there is] to them, and the vision of the fourth is likened to son of God.

26. Then Nebuchadnezzar came forward to the door of the [2furnace  3of fire  1burning], and he said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, O servants  of God the highest, come forth and come! And came forth Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego from out of the midst of the fire.

27. And [3were brought together 1the 2satraps], and the commandants, and the toparchs, and the mighty ones of the king. And they viewed the men, for [3did not 4dominate over 1the 2fire]  their body, and the hair  of their head was not ablaze, and  their pantaloons did not change, and the scent of fire was not on them.

28. And [3did obeisance 4before 5them 1the 2king] to the lord. And [4responded 1Nebuchadnezzar 2the 3king], and he said, Blessed be the God  of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who sent  his angel, and rescued  his servants, for they relied upon him. And the word of the king they changed, and they delivered up  their bodies unto fire so that they should not serve nor do obeisance to any god except  their God.

29. And I display a decree, Every people, tribe, language, which ever should speak blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego, [2for 3destruction 1shall be], and  their houses for ravaging, in so far as there is no [2God 1other] who shall be able to rescue thus.

30. Then the king prospered  Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego in the region of Babylon.  

## Daniel 4

1.  Nebuchadnezzar's Dream of the Great Tree Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, tribes, languages, to the ones dwelling in all the land; [2peace 4to you 1may 3be multiplied].

2. The signs and the miracles which [4did 5with 6me  1God 2the 3highest] is pleasing before me to announce to you.

3. As of how great  his signs, and as of how mighty  his wonders.  His kingdom [2kingdom 1is an everlasting], and  his authority unto generation and generation.

4. I Nebuchadnezzar was prospering in  my house, and thriving upon  my throne.

5. [2a dream 1I beheld], and it threw me into fear. And I was disturbed upon  my bed, and the visions  of my head disturbed me.

6. And by me was made a decree  to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, so that the interpretation of the dream they should make known to me.

7. And [6entered 1the 2enchanters 3magi 4astrologers 5Chaldeans]. And the dream I told before them; and the interpretation of it they did not make known to me,

8. until Daniel came, whose  name was Belteshazzar (according to the name  of my God) who [3spirit 4of God 2holy 5within 6himself 1has]. And the dream [2before 3him 1I told].

9. O Belteshazzar,  ruler of the enchanters, whom knowing that [2spirit 1holy] is in you, and concerning every mystery [2not 3powerless 1you are], hear the vision  of my dream which I beheld, and the interpretation of it tell to me!

10. And the visions  of my head [2upon  3my bed 1I viewed]. And behold, a tree was in the midst of the earth, and the height of it was great.

11. [3was magnified 1The 2tree], and became strong, and  its height came unto the heaven, and the extent of it into the ends of all the earth.

12.  Its leaves were beautiful, and  its fruit abundant, and a nourishment for all was in it. And underneath it encamped the [2beasts  1wild], and in  its branches dwelt the birds of the heaven; from out of it [3was nourished 1all 2flesh].

13. I viewed in a vision of the night upon  my bed, and behold, a sentinel, even a holy one from heaven came down.

14. And he spoke out loud in strength, and thus he said, Cut down the tree, and pluck off  his branches, and shake off  his leaves, and scatter  his fruit! Let [3be shaken away 1the 2wild beasts] from beneath him, and the birds from  his branches!

15. Only the development  of his roots in the earth allow! even with a bond of iron and brass, and in the tender shoots of grass in the outside; and in the dew of the heaven he shall lay down, and [2with 3the 4wild beasts  1his portion] will be in the grass of the ground.

16.  His heart [2from 3the ones 4of men 1shall be changed], and the heart of a wild beast shall be given to him; and seven times shall change over him.

17. [3through 4the interpretation 5of a sentinel 1The 2word is], and the saying of holy ones the response, that [3should know 1the ones 2living] that the lord is the highest of the kingdom  of men, and to whom ever it should seem good he shall give it, and [4that which is in contempt 5of men 1he will raise up 2over 3it]. 

18.  Daniel Interprets the Dream This  dream I beheld, I the king, Nebuchadnezzar. And you, O Belteshazzar, [2the 3interpretation 1tell]! for all the wise men  of my kingdom are not able [2the 3interpretation 4of it 1to manifest] to me. But you Daniel are able, for [2spirit 3of God 1holy] is in you.

19. Then Daniel, whose  name was Belteshazzar, was rendered speechless for [2hour 1one], and  his thoughts disturbed him. And [3answered 1the 2king] and said, Belteshazzar, the dream and  interpretation [2hasten not 1you]! Belteshazzar answered and said, O lord, let be the dream to the ones detesting you, and the interpretation of it  for your enemies!

20. The tree which you beheld, the one magnified and  strengthened, of which the height came unto the heaven, and the extent of it into all the earth,

21. and  its leaves flourishing, and  its fruit abundant, and a nourishment to all by it, and underneath it dwelt the [2beasts  1wild], and in  its branches encamped the birds of the heaven --

22. You are, O king. For you were magnified and strengthened, and  your greatness was magnified, and it came unto  heaven, and  your dominion unto the ends of the earth.

23. And that [3beheld 1the 2king] a sentinel, and a holy one coming down from the heaven, and he said, Pluck the tree, and destroy it; only the development  of his roots in the earth allow! even with a bond of iron and brass; and in the tender shoots of grass in the outside, and in the dew of the heaven he shall lodge, and with [2beasts 1wild]  will be his portion, until of which time seven seasons should be changed over him. 

24.  Daniel Foretells Nebuchadnezzar's Banishment This is the interpretation of it, O king, and [2an interpretation 3of the highest 1it is] which came upon  my lord the king.

25. And you shall be banished from  men; and [3with 5beasts 4wild 2will be  1your dwelling]; and grass as an ox they shall feed you, and from the dew of the heaven you shall lodge, and seven seasons shall change over you, until of which time you should know that [3dominates 1the 2highest] the kingdom  of men, and to whomever it seems good he will give it.

26. And whereas they said, Allow the development of the roots of the tree in the ground;  your kingdom abides to you from of which ever time you should know the [2authority  1heavenly].

27. On account of this, O king,  [2my counsel 1let] please you, and  [2your sins 3by 4charities 1ransom], and  your iniquities by compassions on the needy! Perhaps it will be lenient to your transgressions.

28. All these things came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.

29. After twelve months, upon the temple  of his kingdom in Babylon while walking,

30. [3responded 1the 2king], and said, [2not 3this 1Is] Babylon the great, which I built for a house of royalty, by the might  of my strength, for the honor  of my glory? 

31.  Nebuchadnezzar's Humiliation With the word [2in 3the 4mouth 5of the 6king 1being], a voice from heaven came, To you it is spoken, O king Nebuchadnezzar,  your kingdom went from you.

32. And from  men they shall banish you, and with [2beasts 1wild]  your dwelling shall be, and grass as an ox they shall feed you, and seven seasons shall change over you, until of which time you shall know that [3dominates 1the 2highest] the kingdom  of men, and to whom ever it seems good to give it.

33. In this  hour the word was completed upon Nebuchadnezzar, and [2from  3men 1he was banished], and [2grass 3as 4an ox 1he ate], and from the dew of the heaven  his body was dipped, until  his hairs [2as 3lions' hairs 1were enlarged], and  his fingernails as birds' claws. 

34.  Nebuchadnezzar Acknowledges God And after the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar  [2my eyes 3unto  4heaven 1lifted up], and  my senses [2unto 3me 1returned], and to the highest I blessed, and to the one living into the eons I praised and glorified. For  his authority [2authority 1is an eternal], and  his kingdom is unto generation and generation.

35. And all the ones inhabiting the earth [2as 3nothing 1are considered]; and according to  his will he does among the force of the of heaven, and among the one dwelling the earth. And there is not one who shall act against  his hand, and says to him, What did you do?

36. At the same  time  my senses returned unto me, and [2into 3the 4honor  5of my kingdom 1I came], and  my appearance returned to me, and  my sovereigns and  my great men sought me; and over  my kingdom I was strengthened, and [2greatness 1more extra] was added to me.

37. Now then I Nebuchadnezzar praise and greatly exalt and glorify the king  of heaven, for all  his works are true, and  his paths equitable, and all the ones going in pride he is able to humble.  

## Daniel 5

1.  King Belshazzar's Feast Belshazzar the king made [2supper 1a great] for his great men -- a thousand; and before the thousand was the wine.

2. And drinking Belshazzar spoke in the tasting of the wine  to bring the items, the ones of gold and the ones of silver which [3brought forth 1Nebuchadnezzar  2his father] from out of the temple  in Jerusalem. And they drank with them -- the king, and  his great men, and  his concubines, and  his mistresses.

3. And they brought the items  of gold, and the ones of silver, which were brought forth from out of the temple  of God  in Jerusalem, and they drank with them -- the king, and  his great men, and  his concubines, and  his mistresses.

4. They drank wine, and they praised the gods  of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of iron, and of wood, and of stones. 

5.  The Writing on the Wall In the same  hour came forth fingers of the hand of a man, and they wrote over against the lamp upon the whitewashed portion of the wall of the house of the king. And the king viewed the knuckles of the hand  writing.

6. Then [3of the 4king 1the 2appearance] changed, and  his thoughts disturbed him, and the bonding together  of his loin parted, and  his knees struck together.

7. And [3yelled 1the 2king] in strength  to bring the magi, and the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. And he said to the wise men of Babylon, Who ever should read  this writing, and  [2its interpretation 1should make known] to me, purple shall be put on him, and the necklace  of gold upon  his neck, and as third in  my kingdom he shall rule.

8. And entering were all the wise men of the king, and they were not able [2the 3writing 1to read], nor [2the 3interpretation 1to make known] to the king.

9. And  king Belshazzar was disturbed, and  his appearance changed in him, and  his great men were disturbed.

10. And the queen entered into the house of the banquet. And [3responded 1the 2queen] and said, O king, [2into 3the 4eon 1live]! [3not 1Let 4disturb 5you  2your thoughts], and  [4appearance 3your 2not 1let] be changed!

11. There is a man in  your kingdom in which [2spirit 5God 3of the 4holy 1is]. And in the days  of your father, vigilance, and understanding, and wisdom as wisdom of God, was found in him; and  king Nebuchadnezzar  your father [3ruler 4of enchanters 5of magi 6of Chaldeans 7and of astrologers 1placed 2him].

12. For [2spirit 1extra] is in him, and intelligence, and understanding of interpreting dreams, and reporting things held, and untying things bonded together -- it is Daniel, and the king put to him the name -- Belteshazzar. Now then let him be called! and  its interpretation he will announce to you.

13. Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And [3said 1the 2king]  to Daniel, Are you Daniel, the one from the sons of the captivity  of Judea, of which [4brought 2the 3king  1my father]?

14. I heard concerning you, that spirit of God is in you, and vigilance, and understanding, and [2wisdom 1extra] is found in you.

15. And now there entered before me the wise men, magi, and astrologers, that  [2this writing 1they should read], and the interpretation they should make known to me. But they were not able to announce to me.

16. And I heard concerning you, that you are able [2judgments 1to interpret]. Now then, if you should be able  [2this writing 1to read], and  its interpretation to make known to me, purple shall be put on you, and the necklace  of gold will be upon  your neck, and as third in  my kingdom you shall rule. 

17.  Daniel Interprets the Writing Then answered Daniel, and he said before the king,  [2your gifts 4yours 1Let 3be], and the present  of your house [2to another 1give]! But I [2the 3writing 1shall read] to the king, and the interpretation of it I shall make known to you.

18. O king,  God the highest [2the 3kingdom 4and 5the 6greatness 7and 8the 9honor 10and 11the 12glory 1gave] to Nebuchadnezzar  your father.

19. And because of the greatness of which he gave to him, all the peoples, tribes, languages were trembling and fearing from before him. Whom he willed he did away with, and whom he willed he beat, and whom he willed he raised up high, and whom he willed he humbled.

20. And when [2was raised up high  1his heart], and  his spirit was fortified  to be prideful, he was brought down from the throne of the kingdom, and the honor was removed from him.

21. And from the men he was driven out, and  his heart [2with 3the 4wild beasts 1was given to be], and with the wild donkeys among which he dwelt. And grass [3as 4an ox 1was fed 2him], and [3of 4the 5dew 6of the 7heaven  1his body 2was dipped], until of which time he knew that [3dominated  1God 2the highest] the kingdom  of men, and to whomever it seems good he gives it.

22. And you,  his son, O Belshazzar, humbled not  your heart in front  of God, of which all these things you knew.

23. And against the lord the God  of heaven you were haughty, and the items  of his house they brought before you; even you, and  your great men, and  your concubines, and  your mistresses [2wine 1drank] in them, and the gods  of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of iron, and of wood, and of stones, the ones that see not, and hear not, and know not, you praised; and the God of whom  your breath is in his hand, and all  your ways -- him you glorified not.

24. On account of this, [4from 5his presence 3was sent 1the knuckle 2of a hand], and  this writing he arranged.

25. And this is the writing being arranged -- Mene, Tekel, Peres.

26. This is the interpretation of the saying, Mene -- God measured  your kingdom and finished it.

27. Tekel -- it was set in the yoke balance scale and found lacking.

28. Peres -- [2was divided  1your kingdom] and was given to the Medes and Persians.

29. And Belshazzar spoke, and they put on  Daniel purple, and the [2necklace  1gold] they put around  his neck, and proclaimed concerning him for him to be [2ruler 1third] in the kingdom.

30. In the same  night [6was done away with 1Belshazzar 2the 3king 4of the 5Chaldeans].

31. And Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being [3years old 1sixty 2two].  

## Daniel 6

1.  Darius Places Daniel Over the Satraps And it was pleasing before Darius, and he placed over the kingdom [3satraps 1a hundred 2twenty],  for them to be in [2entire  3kingdom 1his].

2. And above them [2tacticians 1three], which Daniel was one of them, for the [2to render 4to them  1satraps 3a reckoning], so that the king should not be troubled.

3. And Daniel was over them, for [2spirit 1extra] was in him, and the king placed him over [2entire  3kingdom 1his].

4. And the tacticians and the satraps sought an excuse to find something against Daniel; and any excuse, or transgression, or error they did not find against him, for he was trustworthy.

5. And [3said 1the 2tacticians], We did not find against Daniel an excuse unless it be in the laws of his God.

6. Then the tacticians, and the satraps stood beside the king. And they said to him, O king Darius, [2into 3the 4eons 1live]!

7. [5took counsel 1All 2the ones 3over  4your kingdom] -- the commandants, and satraps, the supreme leaders, and toparchs,  to establish [2position 1a royal], and to strengthen an enactment, so that whoever should ask a request from any god or man, for [2days 1thirty], except from you, O king, shall be put into the pit of the lions.

8. Now then, O king, establish the enactment, and display in writing how [6should not 7be changed 1the 2decree 3of the Persians 4and 5Medes]!

9. Then  king Darius gave orders to write the decree.

10. And when Daniel knew that [3was arranged 1the 2decree], he went into  his house, and the windows were open to him in  his upper rooms before Jerusalem. And [2times 1three] of the day he was bending upon  his knees, and praying, and making acknowledgment before  his God, as he was doing before.

11. Then  those men closely watched, and they found  Daniel petitioning and beseeching  his God.

12. And coming forward, they say to the king, O king, did you not [2an enactment 1order] so that every man who ever should ask from any God or man a request unto [2days 1thirty], except from you, O king, shall be put into the pit  of lions? And [3said 1the 2king], [3is true 1The 2word], and the decree of the Medes and Persians shall not pass. 

13.  Daniel Thrown into the Lion's Pit Then they responded, and they spoke before the king, saying, Daniel, the one from the sons of the captivity  of Judea was not submitted to your decree; and [2times 1three] of the day he asks of  his God the requests of his.

14. Then the king, as he heard the saying, [2much 1fretted] over him; and concerning  Daniel he struggled  to rescue him, and until evening he was struggling  to rescue him.

15. Then  those men say to the king, Know, O king! that the decree of the Medes and Persians,  every enactment and position which the king shall establish must not be altered.

16. Then the king spoke, and they led  Daniel, and they put him into the pit of the lions. But [3said 1the 2king] to Daniel,  Your God in whom you serve continually, he will rescue you.

17. And they brought [2stone 1one], and they placed it upon the mouth of the pit, and [3set seal on it 1the 2king] with  his ring, and with the ring  of his great men; so that [2should not 3be changed 1the thing] with regard  to Daniel.

18. And [3went forth 1the 2king] unto  his house, and he went to bed supperless; and food was not carried in to him, and  sleep left from him.

19. Then the king rose up in the morning at the light. And in haste he came unto the pit of the lions.

20. And at  his approaching to the pit [2to 3Daniel 1he yelled 5voice 4a strong], Daniel, O servant of the living God,  your God in whom you serve continually, was he able to rescue you from out of the mouth of the lions?

21. And Daniel said to the king, O king, [2into 3the 4eons 1live]!

22.  My God sent  his angel, and he obstructed the mouths of the lions, and they did not lay me waste; for before him uprightness was found in me; and even before you, O king, [3a transgression 1I did not 2commit]. 

23.  Daniel's Accusers Are Thrown into the Pit Then the king felt much good over him, and  spoke for Daniel to be brought from out of the pit. And they bore Daniel from out of the pit, and all hurt was not found on him, for he trusted in  his God.

24. And [3spoke 1the 2king], and they led the men, the ones accusing  Daniel, and [3into 4the 5pit 6of the 7lions 1they put 2them], and  their sons, and  their wives. And they did not come unto the floor of the pit before  [3dominated 4them 1the 2lions], and [2all  3of their bones 1made fine].

25. Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, tribes, and languages, to the ones living in all the earth, saying, Peace be multiplied unto you.

26. From my presence I made a decree for the one in every rule  of my kingdom to be trembling and fearing from the face of the God of Daniel. For he is the living God, and the one abiding into the eons, and  his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and  his dominion is unto the end.

27. He takes hold of and he rescues, and he produces signs and miracles in the heaven and upon the earth, who rescued  Daniel from the mouth of the lions.

28. And Daniel prospered during the kingdom of Darius, and during the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.  

## Daniel 7

1.  Daniel's Dream of the Four Beasts In the first year of Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans, Daniel [2a dream 1beheld], and the visions  of his head upon  his bed. And  [2his dream 1he wrote], and the total sum of the words he said,

2. I Daniel viewed in my vision of the night. And behold, the four winds of the heaven struck up in the [2sea  1great].

3. And four [2wild beasts 1great] ascended from out of the sea, differing from one another.

4. The first was as a lioness, and her wings were of an eagle. I viewed until of which time [2were plucked  1her wings], and she was lifted away from the earth, and upon the feet of a man she stood, and the heart of a man was given to her.

5. And behold, [2wild beast 1a second] likened to a bear, and on [2part 1one] she stood, and three ribs were in  her mouth, in between  her teeth. And so they said to her, Rise up, eat [2flesh 1much]!

6. After it I viewed, and behold, another wild beast as a leopard; and to her [2wings 1were four] of a bird above her, and four heads were to the wild beast, and authority was given to her.

7. After this I viewed, and behold, [2wild beast 1a fourth], fearful and utterly astonishing, and [2great 1extremely], and  its teeth iron, strong, eating, and making fine, and the rest with its feet it trampled. And it was [2diverse 1extremely] from all the wild beasts, the ones before it. And [2horns 1ten] were to it.

8. I paid attention to  its horns, and behold, [3horn 1another 2small] ascended in the midst of them, and three horns  prior to it were rooted out from in front of it. And behold, eyes as eyes of a man were in  this horn, and a mouth speaking great things. 

9.  The Judgment Seat I viewed until when thrones were set, and the old one of days sat down. And  his garment was as snow -- white. And the hair  of his head was as [2wool 1pure].  His throne a flame of fire,  its wheels as fire blazing.

10. A river of fire drew exiting before him; a thousand thousands ministering to him; and ten thousand ten thousands were present before him. A judgment seat was set, and books were opened.

11. I viewed then because of a voice of the [2words  1great] which  that horn spoke, until [3was done away with 1the 2wild beast], and destroyed, and  its body was given unto burning fire.

12. And [3of the 4rest 5of the wild beasts 6was changed over 1the 2rule], and a duration of life was given to them until a time and a season.

13. I viewed in a vision of the night, and behold, with the clouds of the heaven, and one as son of man was coming. And [2unto 3the 4old one  5of days 1he came], and [2before 3him 1he was brought].

14. And to him was given the rule, and the honor, and the kingdom; and all the peoples, tribes, and languages shall serve to him.  His authority [2authority 1is an eternal] which shall not pass away, and  his kingdom shall not be destroyed.

15. [2shuddered  1My spirit], I Daniel, in  my manner, and the visions  of my head disturbed me.

16. And I came forward to one of the ones standing, and the exactness I sought of him to learn concerning all these things. And he spoke to me the exactness; and the interpretation of the words he made known to me. 

17.  Four Beasts -- Four Kingdoms These, the [3wild beasts  2great  1four] -- four kingdoms shall rise up upon the earth,

18. the ones that shall be lifted away. And [3shall take to themselves 4the 5kingdom 1holy ones 2of the highest]; and they shall hold it unto the eon, and unto the eon of the eons.

19. And I sought exactly concerning the [2wild beast  1fourth], that was diverse from every wild beast, [2fearsome 1extremely],  its teeth of iron, and  its fingernails of brass; devouring, and making fine; and [2the 3rest 4with 5its feet 1it trampled upon].

20. And concerning the horns of it, of the ten, of the ones in  his head, and of the other one of the ascending and shaking off the former three, that horn in which the eyes and mouth spoke great things, and the sight of it was greater than the rest,

21. I viewed, and  that horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them,

22. until of which time [4came 1the 2old one  3of days], and  [2judgment 1gave] to holy ones of the highest. And the time came, and [4of the 5kingdom 3took control 1the 2holy ones].

23. And he said, The [2wild beast  1fourth 5kingdom 4a fourth 3will be] on the earth, which shall excel all the kingdoms, and shall devour all the earth, and shall trample upon it and cut it in pieces.

24. And the ten horns of it are ten kings, and they shall rise up. And after them shall rise up another who shall overwhelm all the ones prior, and three kings he shall humble,

25. and words against the highest he shall speak, and the holy ones of the highest he shall mislead, and shall be of the opinion  to change times and law. And it shall be granted in his hand until a time and times and half a time.

26. And the judgment seat he shall set, and the rule shall change over  to remove it from view, and  to destroy it until the end.

27. And the kingdom, and the authority, and the greatness of the kings  underneath all the heaven was given to holy ones of the highest. And  his kingdom [2kingdom 1is an eternal], and all the sovereignties [4him 1shall serve 2and 3obey].

28. Unto here is the end of the matter. I Daniel, very much the thoughts of mine disturbed me, and  my appearance changed upon me, and the matter [2in  3my heart 1I preserved].  

## Daniel 8

1.  Daniel's Vision of the Ram In [2year 1the third] of the kingdom of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared to me, I Daniel, after the appearing to me the beginning.

2. And I was in Sushan in the palace, the one which is in the region of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was upon the Ulai.

3. And I lifted  my eyes and looked. And behold, [2ram 1one] standing before the Ubal; and there was to him horns, and the horns were high; and the one was higher than the other, and the high one ascended up last.

4. And I beheld the ram butting towards the west, and the north, and the south; and all the wild beasts shall not stand before him, and there was no one  rescuing from out of his hand; and he did according to  his will, and he was magnified. 

5.  The He-goat And I was perceiving. And behold, a he-goat of the goats came from the southwest upon the face of all the earth, and was not touching the earth. And to the he-goat was a horn which may be viewed between  his eyes.

6. And he came unto the ram, the one [2the 3horns 1having], which I beheld standing before the Ubal, and it ran against him with the thrust  of his strength.

7. And I beheld him anticipating unto the ram, and he was furiously enraged against him, and he hit the ram, and he broke both  of his horns; and there was no strength to the ram  to stand before him; and he tossed him upon the ground, and trampled upon him, and there was not  one rescuing the ram from out of his hand.

8. And the he-goat of the goats was magnified even unto exceedingly. And in  his being strong [4was broken  3horn 1his  2great], and there ascended another [2horns 1four] underneath him unto the four winds of the heaven.

9. And from out of the one of them came forth [3horn 1one 2strong], and was magnified extremely towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the setting of the sun.

10. And it was magnified unto the force of the heaven; and it fell upon the earth from the force of the of heaven, and from the stars, and he trampled upon them.

11. And unto the commander-in-chief he was magnified, and through him the sacrifice was disturbed, and the holy place shall be made desolate.

12. And [2was given 3for 4the 5sacrifice 1a sin offering], and [2was tossed 3onto the ground  1righteousness]; and he performed and was prospered.

13. And I heard one holy one speaking. And [3said 1one 2holy one] to the Phelmouni, to the one speaking, For how long shall the vision stand, [3the 4sacrifice 1the 2taking away], and [3the 4sin 5of desolation 1the 2granting], and the holy place and the force shall be trampled upon?

14. And he said to him, Unto evening and morning [3days 1two thousand 2three hundred], and [3shall be cleansed 1the 2holy place].

15. And it came to pass in  my beholding, I Daniel, the vision, and I sought understanding. And behold, there stood before me as an appearance of a man. 

16.  Gabriel Brings Understanding to Daniel And I heard the voice of a man in the midst of the Ulai. And he called, and said, Gabriel, bring understanding [3for that one 1the 2vision]!

17. And he came and stood next to  my position. And in  his coming I was distraught, and I fell upon my face. And he said to me, Take notice, O son of man! [4is still 1for 5for 7time 6end 2the 3vision].

18. And in  his speaking with me, I fell upon my face unto the earth. And he touched me, and he stood me upon my feet.

19. And he said, Behold, I make known to you the things being at the last of the wrath, for it is yet for [2of time 1end].

20. The ram which you beheld, the one having the horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians.

21. And the he-goat of the goats is the king of the Greeks, and the [2horn  1great], the one that was in between  his eyes, he is the [2king  1foremost].

22. And of the one being broken, of which [3stood 1four 2horns] underneath -- four kings from out of  his nation shall rise up, and not in  his strength.

23. And at the last  of their kingdom, being full of the sins, shall rise up a king with an impudent face, and perceiving riddles.

24. And [2is fortified  1his strength], and not by  his strength. And wonderfully he shall corrupt, and shall prosper, and shall perform, and shall corrupt strong ones, and [2people 1a holy].

25. And the yoke of the collar shall prosper; treachery in his hand, and [2in 3his heart 1he shall magnify himself], and by treachery he shall corrupt many, and for a destruction of many he shall establish himself; and as eggs in a hand he shall break.

26. And the vision of the evening and of the morning of the thing being spoken -- it is true. And you set a seal upon the vision, for it is for many days!

27. And I Daniel went to bed, and I was infirm for days. And I rose up and I did the works of the king; and I wondered at the vision, and there was no one  perceiving.  

## Daniel 9

1.  The Prayer of Daniel In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of Chaldeans,

2. in year one  of his kingdom, I Daniel perceived in the books the number of the years of which [3became 1the word 2of the lord] to Jeremiah the prophet for a fulfillment of the desolation of Jerusalem -- seventy years.

3. And I put  my face towards the lord  God,  to inquire by prayer and supplication, in fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.

4. And I prayed to the lord  my God, and I made acknowledgment, and I said, O lord, the [4God  1great 2and 3wonderful],  keeping  your covenant, and the mercy to the ones loving you, and to the ones keeping  your commandments;

5. we sinned, we did wrong, we were impious, and we left and turned aside from  your commandments, and from  your judgments.

6. And we did not listen to  your servants the prophets, the ones speaking in  your name to  our kings, and our rulers, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

7. To you, O lord, is righteousness, and to us the shame  of face, as  this day; to the man of Judah, and to the ones dwelling Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to the ones near, and to the ones far off in all the earth, of which you dispersed them there, for their rebellion in which they annulled covenant with you, O lord.

8. To us  shame  of face, and to our kings, and to our rulers, and to our fathers, to the ones who sinned against you.

9. To the lord our God are the compassions, and the atonements, for we separated from the lord.

10. And we hearkened not to the voice of the lord  our God, to go by  his laws, the ones which he executed before our face by the hands  of his servants the prophets.

11. And all Israel violated  your law, and turned aside  to not hearken to  your voice; and there came upon us the curse, and the oath, the one having been written in the law of Moses the servant  of God, for we sinned against him.

12. And he established  his words which he spoke against us, and against  our judges, the ones judging us, to bring upon us [2evils 1great]; such as have not taken place underneath all of the heaven, according to the things taking place in Jerusalem.

13. As was written in the law of Moses, all  these evils came upon us. And we did not beseech the face of the lord  our God, to turn from  our iniquities, and  to perceive in all truth.

14. And [3was vigilant 1the lord  2our God] against the evil, and brought them upon us. For [3is just 1the lord  2our God] in all  his doing which he did. And we hearkened not to  his voice.

15. And now, O lord  our God, who led  your people from the land of Egypt by [2hand 1a fortified], and you made for yourself a name as it is this day -- we sinned, we acted lawlessly, we transgressed.

16. O lord, in all your charity let turn indeed  your rage, and  your anger from  your city Jerusalem, [2mountain 1your holy]! For we sinned in  our iniquities, and of the ones of our fathers. Jerusalem and  your people [2for 3scorn 1became] among all the ones surrounding us. 

17.  Daniel Pleads for God's Mercy And now, hearken O lord  our God, of the prayer  of your servant and  his supplications! And let [2appear  1your face] upon  your sanctified place, the deserted one, because of you O lord!

18. Lean, O my God,  your ear, and hearken! Open  your eyes, and behold  our extinction! and  of your city upon which [2is called  1your name] upon it. For not upon  our righteousness we toss  our compassion before you, but upon  [3compassions 1your  2great], O lord.

19. Hearken, O lord! Atone, O lord! Take heed, O lord! Act, and do not delay for your sake, O lord  my God! For  your name is called upon  your city, and upon  your people.

20. And yet during my speaking, and praying, and declaring openly  my sins, and the sins  of my people Israel, and tossing  my desire for mercy before the lord  my God concerning the [2mountain  1holy]  of my God,

21. and yet during my speaking in the prayer, that behold, the man Gabriel, whom I beheld in the vision at the beginning flying, and he touched me about the hour [2sacrifice 1of the evening].

22. And he brought understanding to me, and spoke with me, and said, O Daniel, now I came forth to instruct you for understanding. 

23.  The Seventy Periods of Seven In the beginning  of your supplication [3went forth 1the 2word], and I came  to announce to you; for [2a man 3desired 1you are]. And now reflect in the matter, and perceive in the apparition!

24. Seventy periods of seven were rendered concise upon  your people, and upon the [2city  1holy],  to finish off sin, and  to set a seal upon sins, and to wipe out the lawless deeds, and  to atone for iniquities, and  to bring [2righteousness 1eternal], and  to set a seal upon vision and prophecy, and  to anoint the holy of holies.

25. And you shall know and perceive, from the delivery of the word  to respond and  to build Jerusalem until the anointed one leading -- [2periods of seven 1seven], and [2periods of seven 1sixty-two]. Again [4shall be built 1the square 2and 3wall] in straits of the times.

26. And after the [2periods of seven  1sixty-two], [2shall be utterly destroyed 1the anointing], and judgment is no longer in it. And the city, and the holy place he shall corrupt with the one taking the lead, the one coming, and they shall be cut off as in a flood, and [3until 4the end 5of war 6being terminated 1he shall order 2in extinctions].

27. And he shall strengthen covenant with many [2period of sevens 1one]; and in the half of the period of seven shall be lifted away sacrifice and libation offering, and upon the temple an abomination of the desolations will be; and until the completion of time, completion shall be given unto the desolation.  

## Daniel 10

1.  Daniel's Vision of the Last Days In [2year 1the third] of Cyrus, king of the Persians, the word was uncovered to Daniel (of whom the name was called Belteshazzar) and [3is true 1the 2word]. And [2ability 1great] and understanding was given to him in the apparition.

2. In  those days, I Daniel was mourning three periods of seven of days.

3. [2bread 1Of desirable] I ate not, and meat and wine did not go into  my mouth, and an anointing I did not anoint with until the fullness of the three period of sevens of days.

4. On the [3day 1twentieth 2and fourth] of the [2month  1first], and I was next to the [2river  1great] -- it is the Tigris.

5. And I lifted  my eyes and looked. And behold, a man, one being clothed with linen clothes, and  his loin being girded in gold of Uphaz.

6. And  his body was as Tharsis stone, and  his face as a sight of lightning, and  his eyes as lamps of fire, and  his arms and  his legs as the sight of brass shining, and the sound  of his words as a sound of a multitude.

7. And [4beheld 1I 2Daniel 3alone] the apparition. And the men, the ones with me, beheld not the apparition, but [2change of state 1a great] fell upon them, and they fled in fear.

8. And I was left behind alone. And I beheld  [2apparition  1this great], and there was not left in me strength, and  my glory converted into corruption, and I held no strength.

9. And I heard the voice  of his words. And in  my hearing the sound of his discourses, I was being vexed, and  my face was upon the ground.

10. And behold, a hand was touching me, and raised me upon  my knees and palms of my hands.

11. And he said to me, Daniel, man desired; perceive by the words which I speak to you, and stand at  your position! for now I am sent to you. And in  his speaking to me  this word, I rose up trembling.

12. And he said to me, Fear not Daniel! for from the [2day  1first] of which you gave  your heart  to perceive, and to afflict yourself before the lord  your God, [2were heard  1your words], and I came because of  your words. 

13.  Michael And the ruler of the kingdom of the Persians stood right opposite me twenty days and one day. And behold, Michael, one of the rulers of the ones foremost, came to help me; and I left him there with the ruler of the kingdom of the Persians.

14. And I came to bring understanding to you as much as shall meet  your people in last of the days. For [3is still 1the 2vision] for days.

15. And in  his speaking with me according to  these words, I put  my face unto the ground, and was vexed.

16. And behold, as a likeness of a son of man touched  my lips, and I opened  my mouth, and I spoke, and said to the one standing before me, O lord, at the apparition of you [2turned  1my within] in me, and I had not strength.

17. And how shall [2be able  1your servant], O lord, to speak after  [2my lord 1this]? And I, from the present shall not stand with strength in me, and there is no breath left in me.

18. And proceeded and touched me as it were a vision of a man. And he strengthened me.

19. And he said to me, Fear not, man desired! Peace to you, be manly and strong! And in  his speaking with me, I strengthened, and I said, Speak,  my lord! for you strengthened me.

20. And he said, Do you know why I came to you? And now, I shall return  to wage war with the ruler of the Persians. And I coming forth, and the ruler of the Greeks came.

21. But I will announce to you the arranging in the writing of truth. And there is no one holding with me concerning these things, except Michael  your ruler.  

## Daniel 11

1.  Persia and Greece And I in [2year 1the first] of Cyrus stood for might and strength.

2. And now [2truth 1I shall announce] to you, Behold, still three kings shall arise in  Persia; and the fourth shall be rich [2riches 1in great], more than all. And after  his prevailing  by his riches, he shall rise up against all the kingdoms of the Greeks.

3. And [3shall rise up 2king 1a mighty], and he shall lord over [2dominion 1a great], and he shall do according to  his will.

4. And when ever [2should stand  1his kingdom], it shall be broken, and shall be divided into the four winds of the heaven; and not unto  his latter end, nor according to  his dominion which he lorded over. For [3was plucked up  2kingdom 1his], and to others outside of these it shall be given. 

5.  The Kings of the North and South And [5grew in strength 1the 2king 3of the 4south]; and one  of his rulers shall grow in strength over him, and shall lord over [2dominion 1a great] by his authority.

6. And after  his years they shall be mixed together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall enter in to the king of the north  to make treaties with him. And she shall not hold strength of arm; and [2shall not 3stand  1his seed], and she shall be delivered up, and the ones bringing her, and the young woman, and the one strengthening her in the times.

7. And one shall rise up from out of the flower  of her root unto  his preparation; and he shall come against the force, and shall enter unto the supporters of the king of the north, and shall deal with them, and shall prevail.

8. And indeed  their gods with  their molten images, and every [2item 1desirable] of theirs of silver and of gold, with the captivity, he shall bring into Egypt. And he shall stand over the king of the north.

9. And he shall enter into the kingdom of the king of the south, and shall return unto  his land.

10. And  his sons shall gather a multitude [2forces 1of many]. And [2shall come 1one coming], even inundating, and shall go by. And he shall settle, and shall grapple together unto  his strength.

11. And [5shall be wild 1the 2king 3of the 4south], and shall come forth and wage war with the king of the north. And he shall establish [2multitude 1a great]; but there shall be delivered up a multitude in his hand.

12. And he shall take the multitude, and [2shall be exalted  1his heart]; and he shall throw down myriads, and he shall not prevail.

13. And [5shall return 1the 2king 3of the 4north], and shall lead [2multitude 1a great] more than the former. And in the end of the times he shall come upon an entrance in [2power 1great], and in [2substance 1much].

14. And in  those times many shall rise up against the king of the south. And the sons of the pestilent ones  of your people shall be lifted up  to establish the vision; and they shall weaken.

15. And [4shall enter 1the king 2of the 3north], and shall discharge a mound, and shall seize [2cities 1fortified]. And the arms of the king of the south shall not stand, and [2shall rise up  1his chosen ones], and there will not be strength  to stand.

16. And [3shall do 1the one 2entering] to him according to  his will, and there is not one standing against his face. And he shall stand in the land  of glory, and it shall be finished off entirely by  his hand.

17. And he shall arrange  his face to enter in the strength of all  his kingdom, and [2upright 1all] with him; thus he shall do. And the daughter  of women he will give to him  to corrupt her. But in no way shall she remain, and [2not 4to him 1she will 3be].

18. And he shall turn  his face unto the islands, and shall seize many. And he will cause [2to cease 1rulers] their scorning, only  his scorning shall return to him.

19. And he shall turn  his face unto the strength  of his land. And he shall weaken, and shall fall, and shall not be found.

20. And shall rise up from out of  his root a plant of a kingdom, unto  his preparation, casting aside, exacting glory of the kingdom. And in  those days he shall be broken, and not in faces, nor in war.

21. One shall stand upon  his preparation, who was treated with contempt, and they did not give unto him glory of the kingdom. And he shall come in prosperity, and he shall prevail over a kingdom by a slip.

22. And the arms of the one inundating shall be flooded from his face, and they shall be broken; even the one taking the lead of the covenant.

23. And because of the interminglings with him he shall deal in treachery. And he shall ascend, and shall excel in strength over him by a little nation.

24. And in prosperity and in plentiful places he shall come; and he shall do what [2did not do  1his fathers], and the fathers  of his fathers. Plunder, and spoils, and substance, [2to them 1he will disperse]. And against Egypt he will devise his devices for a time.

25. And [2shall be awakened  1his strength], and  his heart against the king of the south with [2force 1a great]; and the king of the south shall join together in war, and in [2power 1a great], even in strength exceedingly. And he shall not stand, for they shall devise [2against 3him 1devices].

26. And they shall eat the things necessary of his, and they shall break him, and forces shall break up, and [3shall fall 2slain 1many].

27. And both the kings --  their hearts are for wickedness, and at [2table 1one 4lies 3they shall speak], and it shall not straighten out, for the end is for a time.

28. And he shall return unto  his land with [2substance 1much], and  his heart against [2covenant 1holy]. And he shall act, and he shall return unto  his land.

29. In the time he shall return, and he shall come in the south, and it will not be as the first and the last.

30. And they shall enter in it, even the ones coming forth, the Chittim. And he shall be humbled, and he shall return, and he shall be enraged against [2covenant 1holy]; and he shall act, and he shall return, and he shall perceive with the ones forsaking [2covenant 1holy]. 

31.  The Sanctuary of the Might Profaned And [3arms 1from 2him] shall rise up, and shall profane the sanctuary of the might. And they shall change over the perpetual sacrifice, and shall offer [2abomination 1an obliterating].

32. And the ones acting lawlessly [2a covenant 1shall bring upon] by a slip. And a people knowing his God shall grow strong, and shall act.

33. And the discerning of the people shall perceive in many things, and they shall be weak by the broadsword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by ravaging of days.

34. And in the weakening of them they shall be helped [2help 1with a little], and [2shall be added 3unto 4them 1many] by a slip.

35. And of the ones perceiving shall weaken,  to purify them by fire, and  to choose, and  to be uncovered until the time of the end. For it is still for a time. 

36.  The Wicked King And he shall do according to  his will; and the king shall be exalted, and magnified over every god, and over the God  of gods. And he shall speak pompous words, and shall prosper until of which time [3should be completed 1the 2wrath]. For unto completion it is coming to pass.

37. And unto all gods  of his fathers he will not take notice, nor the desire of women; and concerning every god he will not take notice; for above all he will be magnified.

38. And [2a god 3of fortress 4at  5his place 1he will glorify]. And a god whom [2knew not  1his fathers] he shall glorify with gold, and silver, and [2stone 1precious], and with desirable things.

39. And he shall act in the fortresses  of refuge with a strange god, of which ever he should recognize. And he shall multiply glory, and shall submit to them many; and the land he shall divide by gifts.

40. And in [2time 1end] he will mix horns with the king of the south; and [4shall be gathered together 5unto 6him 1the king 2of the 3north] with chariots, and with horsemen, and with [2ships 1many]. And he shall enter into the land, and he shall break and go by.

41. And he shall enter into the land  of glory, and many shall be weakened. And these shall be delivered from out of his hand -- Edom and Moab, and the sovereignty of the sons of Ammon.

42. And he shall stretch out  his hand upon the land; and the land of Egypt will not be for deliverance.

43. And he shall dominate by the concealed things  of gold and  of silver, and in all the desirable things of Egypt, and of the Libyans, and Ethiopians, in  their fortresses.

44. And hearings shall disturb him from out of the east, and the north. And he shall come in rage with many  to obliterate, and  to devote [2to consumption 1many].

45. And he shall pitch  his tent of a royal pavilion between the seas, in [2mountain 3of glory 1the holy]. And he shall come unto his parts, and there shall be the one rescuing him.  

## Daniel 12

1.  The Time of the End And in  that time shall rise up Michael the [2ruler  1great], the one standing for the sons  of your people. And it will be a time of affliction such as has not taken place from of which time there became a nation on the earth, until  that time. And in  that time [2shall be delivered  1your people], every one  found being written in the book.

2. And many of the ones sleeping in [2of earth 1an embankment] shall awaken, these unto [2life 1eternal], and these others unto scorning, and for [2shame 1eternal].

3. And the ones perceiving shall shine forth as the brightness of the firmament; and of the [2righteous  1many] as the stars into the eons and still.

4. And you Daniel obstruct the words, and set a seal upon the scroll until the time of completion! until [2should be taught 1many], and [3be multiplied 1the 2knowledge].

5. And I beheld, I Daniel, and behold, two others stood, one here  on this bank of the river, and one here on the other bank of the river.

6. And they said to the man  being clothed with the linen clothes, who was upon the water of the river, Until when will be the end of which you have spoken of the wonders?

7. And I heard the man, of the one being clothed with the linen clothes, who was upon the water of the river. And he raised up high  his right hand, and  his left unto the heaven. And he swore an oath to the one living into the eon, that for a time and times and half a time, in the completing the dispersing hand of people having been sanctified, they shall know all these things.

8. And I heard, and I perceived not. And I said, O lord, what  of these last things?

9. And he said, Go Daniel! for [3are obstructed 4and 5sealed 1the 2words] until [2time 1end].

10. [2shall be chosen 3and 4whitened 5and 6purified by fire 7and 8sanctified 1Many]. And [2shall act lawlessly 1the lawless ones], and [3shall not 4perceive 1all 2the lawless ones], but the intelligent shall perceive.

11. And from the time of the alteration of the perpetual sacrifice, and the putting of the abomination of desolation -- [4days 1a thousand 2two hundred 3ninety].

12. Blessed is the one enduring and coming into [4days 1a thousand 2three hundred 3thirty-five].

13. And you, go, for satisfying completion. And you shall rest, and shall rise up at  your lot at the completion of days.
