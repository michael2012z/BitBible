## 2 Samuel 1

1.  The Death of Saul and Jonathan And it came to pass after the dying of Saul, that David returned from striking  Amalek. And David stayed in Ziklag [2days 1two].

2. And it came to pass in the [2day  1third], that behold, a man came from out of the camp of the people of Saul, and  his clothes were torn up, and earth was upon  his head. And it happened in  his entering to David, that he fell upon the ground and did obeisance to him.

3. And [2said 3to him 1David], From what place do you come? And he said to him, From out of the camp of Israel I have come through safe.

4. And [2said 3to him 1David], What  word is this? Report to me! And he said, [3have fled 1The 2people] from the battle, and [2have fallen 1many] of the people, and they died; and Saul and Jonathan  his son died.

5. And David said to the servant-lad, In the reporting it, how do you know that [5have died 1Saul 2and 3Jonathan  4his son]?

6. And [3said 1the 2servant-lad]  reporting to him, By chance I fell among the mountain  of Giboa; and behold, Saul was stayed upon  his spear; and behold, the chariots and the commanders of the cavalry joined together against him.

7. And he looked behind him, and he beheld me, and he called me. And I said, Behold, it is I.

8. And he said to me, Who are you? And I said, [3an Amalekite 1I 2am].

9. And he said to me, Stand indeed above me, and put me to death! for [3constrained 4me 2darkness 1an awful], for [2is yet  1my life] in me.

10. And I stood over him, and put him to death, for I knew that he would not live after  he fell. And I took the crown, the one upon  his head, and the armlet, the one upon  his arm, and I brought them to my master here. 

11.  Israel Mourns for Saul and Jonathan And David took hold  of his clothes, and tore them; and all the men, the ones with him.

12. And they beat their chests and wept, and fasted until evening over Saul, and over Jonathan  his son, and over the people of Judah, and over the house of Israel, because they were struck by the broadsword.

13. And David said to the servant-lad, the one reporting to him, From what place are you? And he said, [3the son 6man 5sojourner 4of an Amalekite 1I 2am].

14. And [2said 3to him 1David], How is it you do not fear to bear your hand to utterly destroy the anointed one of the lord?

15. And David called one  of his servant-lads, and he said, Coming forward, you meet him! And he struck him, and he died.

16. And [2said 3to 4him 1David],  Your blood be upon  your head, for  your mouth answered against you, saying, I put to death the anointed one of the lord.

17. And David lamented  this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan  his son.

18. And he spoke  to teach the sons of Judah. Behold, it is written upon the scroll of the upright.

19. And he said, Set up a stone monument, O Israel, for the ones having died upon  your heights -- being slain! How [2are fallen 1the mighty ones].

20. Announce it not in Gath, and announce it not as good news in the streets of Ashkelon! lest at any time [3should be glad 1the daughters 2of the Philistines], lest at any time [4should exult 1the daughters 2of the 3uncircumcised].

21. O mountains  in Gilboa, may there not fall upon you neither dew nor rain; and O fields of first-fruits, for there [3was loathed 1the shield 2of the mighty ones], the shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.

22. From the blood of the slain, and from the fat of the mighty ones, the bow of Jonathan did not return empty to the rear; and the broadsword of Saul did not return empty.

23. Saul and Jonathan, the ones being loved, and beautiful ones; not parted in  their life, and in  their death they were not parted. [2above 3eagles 1Nimble], and [2above 3lions 1strong].

24. Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul! the one dressing you with scarlet apparel, with your ornament; the one bearing [2ornament 1a golden] for  your clothes.

25. How [2fell 1the mighty ones] in the midst of battle, O Jonathan, upon  your heights you were slain.

26. I ache over you, Jonathan, O my brother. You were beautiful to me, exceedingly; [3caused wonder  1your affection 2to me] -- above the affection of women.

27. O how [2fell 1the mighty ones], and [3perished 1the weapons 2of warfare].  

## 2 Samuel 2

1.  David Dwells in Hebron And it came to pass after these things, and David asked by the lord, saying, Shall I ascend unto one of the cities  of Judah? And the lord said to him, Ascend! And David said, Where should I ascend? And he said, Unto Hebron.

2. And [2ascended 3there 1David], and both  his wives -- Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

3. And the men  were with him, each one and  his house. And they dwelt among the cities of Hebron.

4. And [4come 1the 2men  3of Judea] and anoint  David there  to reign over the house of Judah. And they reported  to David, saying, The men of Jabish of the Gileadites entombed  Saul.

5. And David sent messengers to the leaders of Jabish of the Gileadites, And he said to them, Being blessed are you to the lord, that you performed  this mercy for  your master, for  Saul, and you entombed him.

6. And now, may the lord perform [4with 5you 1mercy 2and 3truth]; and indeed I will do with you  this good that you did  in this matter.

7. And now strengthen  your hands and become as [2sons 1mighty]! for [3has died 1Saul  2your master], and indeed [4has anointed me 1the 2house 3of Judah] over them for king.

8. And Abner son of Ner, commander-in-chief  of Saul, took  Ishbosheth son  of Saul, and brought him from out of the camp into Mahanaim,

9. and gave him to reign over  Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over  Jezreel, and over  Ephraim, and over  Benjamin, and over all Israel. 

10.  Ishbosheth Reigns in Israel [4was forty 5years old 1Ishbosheth 2son 3of Saul] when he reigned over Israel; and [2two 3years 1he reigned]; except for the house of Judah, the ones which were following after David.

11. And became the number of the days which David reigned in Hebron over the house of Judah -- seven years and [2months 1six].

12. And [4came forth 1Abner 2son 3of Ner], and the servants of Ishbosheth son of Saul, out of Mahanaim unto Gibeon.

13. And Joab son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, came forth out of Hebron, and met them at the fountain  of Gibeon. And these sat here on this side, and these others at the fountain here on that side.

14. And Abner said to Joab, Raise up indeed the servant-lads and let them play before us! And Joab said, Let them arise!

15. And they rose up and went by in number -- twelve of the servants of Benjamin  of Ishbosheth son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 

16.  Abner Wars with David And they [2held 1each] by their hand the head  of his neighbor; and  his knife was thrust into the side  of his neighbor; and they fell down together. And they called  that place, Portion of the Plotters, which is in Gibeon.

17. And [3was 1the 2battle] hard so as to an exceeding degree in  that day. And [6failed 1Abner 2and 3the 4men 5of Israel] before the servants of David.

18. And there were there three sons of Zeruiah -- Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was light  of his feet, as one doe of the ones in the field.

19. And Asahel pursued after Abner, and he did not turn aside  to go to the right nor to the left after Abner.

20. And Abner looked to  his rear, and said, Are you Asahel himself? And he said, I am. 

21.  Abner Kills Asahel And [2said 3to him 1Abner], Turn aside to the right or to the left, and constrain to yourself one of the servant-lads, and take to yourself  his full armor! And [2did not 3want 1Asahel] to turn aside from  being behind him.

22. And [2added 3yet 1Abner], saying  to Asahel, Leave from me! that I should not strike you unto the ground. For how shall I lift  my face to Joab  your brother?

23. And he was not willing  to leave. And [2struck 3him 1Abner] with the rear of the spear upon his flank. And [3went completely through 1the 2spear] out  behind him. And he falls there and dies underneath him. And it came to pass every one  coming unto the place where [2fell 3there 1Asahel] and died, even stood still.

24. And [4pursued 1Joab 2and 3Abishai] after Abner, and the sun went down. And they entered unto the hill of Ammah, according to the face of Giah, [2way 1the wilderness] of Gibeon.

25. And [4gathered together 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin], the ones following after Abner, and they came to meet as one, and they stood upon the head [2hill 1of one].

26. And Abner called  Joab, and he said, Shall [4in 5victory 3devour 1the 2broadsword], or do you not know that it will be bitter at the last? And for how long [2in no way 1shall you] speak to the people to return from following after  their brethren?

27. And Joab said, As the lord lives, that if you had not spoken, because then from the morning [3ascended 4even 1the 2people] each after  his brother.

28. And Joab trumped the trumpet, and [4left 1all 2the 3people], and did not pursue any longer after  Israel, and they did not proceed any longer  to wage war.

29. And Abner and  his men went forth at the descent of the sun, and went all  that night, and passed over the Jordan, and they went the entire  extent, and they came unto Camp.

30. And Joab returned from following behind  Abner, And he gathered together all the people. And they numbered the servants of David, the ones having fallen -- nineteen men and Asahel.

31. And the servants of David struck of the sons of Benjamin, of the men of Abner -- three hundred and sixty men.

32. And they lifted up  Asahel, and they entombed him in the burying-place  of his father in Beth-lehem. And [4went 5the entire  6night 1Joab 2and  3his men], and light shined through to them in Hebron.  

## 2 Samuel 3

1.  The House of Saul Wars with the House of David And there was war for a long time between the house of Saul, and between the house of David. And the house of David went and strengthened. And the house of Saul went and weakened.

2. And were born to David in Hebron [2sons 1six], and [2was  1his first-born] was Amnon  by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

3. and  his second was Chileab of Abigail the Carmelitess; and the third was Absalom son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

4. and the fourth was Adonijah son of Haggith; and the fifth was Shephatiah  by Abital;

5. and the sixth was Ithream of Eglah wife of David. These were born to David in Hebron.

6. And it came to pass in the being the war between the house of Saul, and between the house of David, that Abner was holding rule over the house of Saul.

7. And to Saul was a concubine, and the name to her was Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. And [4said 1Ishbosheth 2son 3of Saul] to Abner, Why is it that you enter to the concubine  of my father?

8. And [2was enraged 3exceedingly 1Abner] on account of  this word  by Ishbosheth. And Abner said to him, Am [3head 2a dog's 1I] that I executed today mercy with the house of Saul  your father, and with his brethren, and with his acquaintances, and did not desert to the house of David, that you seek anxiously about me concerning injustice to a woman today?

9. Thus may God do  to Abner, and thus may he add to him that as the lord swore by an oath  to David, that so I should do the same to him in  this day,

10. to remove the kingdom from the house of Saul, and  to raise up the throne of David over Israel, and over  Judah, from Dan until Beer-sheba.

11. And [2was not 3able 4still 1Ishbosheth] to answer  Abner's utterance, because of  fearing him. 

12.  Abner Ordains a Covenant with David And Abner sent messengers to David in Hebron, saying, [2ordain 3a covenant 1You] with me! And behold,  My hand is with you to return to you all Israel.

13. And David said, Well, I shall ordain with you a covenant, except [2word 1one] I ask from you, saying, You shall not see  my face, if you do not lead  Michal daughter of Saul, in your coming to behold  my face.

14. And David sent [2to 3Ishbosheth 4son 5of Saul 1messengers], saying, Give back to me  my wife  Michal which I took for a hundred foreskins of Philistines.

15. And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from  her husband, from Phaltiel son of Laish.

16. And [3went  2husband 1her] with her, going and weeping after her unto Behurim. And [2said 3to 4him 1Abner], Go return! And he returned.

17. And the word of Abner came to the elders of Israel, saying, Yesterday and the third day before you sought  David to reign over you.

18. And now act! for the lord spoke concerning David, saying, By the hand  of my servant David I will deliver  my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all  his enemies.

19. And Abner spoke in the ears of Benjamin. And Abner went  to speak into the ears of David in Hebron, all as much as it pleased in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin.

20. And Abner came to David in Hebron, and with him twenty men. And David made [2to 3Abner 4and 5the 6men  7with 8him 1a banquet].

21. And Abner said to David, I will arise indeed and go, and gather together to  my master the king all Israel; and I will ordain with you a covenant, and you shall reign over all whom [2desires  1your soul]. And David sent away  Abner, and he went in peace.

22. And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from the expedition, and [3spoils 2many 1they brought] with themselves. And Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he went in peace.

23. And Joab, and all the military, the one with him, came. And they reported to Joab, saying, [4comes 1Abner 2son 3of Ner] to David, and he has sent him, and he went forth in peace.

24. And Joab entered to the king, and he said to him, What is this you did? Behold, Abner came to you, and why have you sent him away, and he has gone forth in peace?

25. Or do you not know the evil of Abner son of Ner, that [2to deceive 3you 1he came], and to know  your entering and  your exiting, and to know all together as much as you do?

26. And Joab went from David, and sent messengers after Abner, and they returned him from the well of Sirah; and David did not know. 

27.  Joab Kills Abner And Abner returned to Hebron, and [2turned 3him 1Joab] from the side of the gate to speak to him laying in wait. And he struck him there in the flank, and he died for the blood [2Asahel  1of his brother].

28. And David heard about these things, and he said, [2am innocent 1I] and  my kingdom from the lord and unto the eon of the blood of Abner son of Ner.

29. Let it arrive upon the head of Joab, and upon all the house  of his father! and may there not cease to be one from the house of Joab having gonorrhea, and leprous, and holding a stave, and falling by the broadsword, and lacking bread loaves.

30. For Joab and Abishai  his brother observed  Abner, because he killed  Asahel  their brother in Gibeon in the battle.

31. And David said to Joab, and to all the people  with him, Tear  your clothes, and gird on sackcloths, and lament before Abner! And  king David went behind the bier.

32. And they entombed  Abner in Hebron, and [3lifted 1the 2king]  his voice and wept over the tomb of Abner, and [4wept 1all 2the 3people]. 

33.  David and Israel Lament Abner's Death And [3lamented 1the 2king] over Abner, and said, Shall [3according to 4the 5death 6of Nabal 2die 1Abner], no.

34.  Your hands were not tied, nor  your feet not in shackles; you did not lead as Nabal; [2in the presence 3of a son 4of injustice 1you fell]. And [4were brought together 1all 2the 3people]  to weep for him.

35. And [4came 1all 2the 3people] to cause [2to eat 4at the wake  1David 3bread loaves] still being day. And David swore by an oath, saying, Thus may [2do 3to me  1God], and thus may he add yet more, that until [3should 4go down 1the 2sun], in no way shall I taste bread nor any thing.

36. And all the people knew. And it was pleasing before them, all as much as [3did 1the 2king] in the presence of all the people.

37. And [4knew 1all 2the 3people], and all Israel in  that day, that [6happened not 7by 8the 9king 1the 2putting to death  3of Abner 4son 5of Ner].

38. And [3said 1the 2king] to  his servants, Do you not know that a leader, and a great one has fallen in  this day in  Israel?

39. And that I am as a relative today, and one being placed for king.  But these men, the sons of Zeruiah [2hard 3for me 1are]. The lord should recompense to the one doing the wicked things according to  his evil.  

## 2 Samuel 4

1.  Ishbosheth Fears David And [4heard 1Ishbosheth 2son 3of Saul] that Abner has died in Hebron, and [2were faint  1his hands], and all the men of Israel were disturbed.

2. And there were two men being leaders of the confederation  of Ishbosheth son of Saul -- the name to the one was Baanah, and the name of the second, Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from out of the sons of Benjamin; for also Beeroth was considered among the sons of Benjamin.

3. And [3ran away 1the 2Beerothites] unto Gittaim, and they were there sojourning until  this day.

4. And  to Jonathan, son of Saul, there was a son stricken in the feet, a son [2years old 1five]; and this one was in the way in the coming of the message of Saul and Jonathan  his son from out of Jezreel; and [2lifted 3him  1his wet-nurse] and fled. And it happened in  her hastening and withdrawing he fell and became lame. And the name to him was Mephibosheth. 

5.  Ishbosheth Is Murdered And [6went out 1the 2sons 3of Rimmon 4the 5Beerothite], Rechab and Baana; and they entered in the sweltering heat of the day into the house of Ishbosheth, and he was asleep in the bed in the midday.

6. And behold, the doorkeeper of the house was cleansing wheat, and he slumbered and slept. And Rechab and Baanah  his brother escaped notice.

7. And they entered into the house. And Ishbosheth was sleeping upon  his bed in  his bedroom. And they strike him, and put him to death, and remove  his head. And they took  his head, and went forth in the way, the one according to the west, the entire  night.

8. And they brought the head of Ishbosheth  to David in Hebron. And they said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth son of Saul  your enemy, who sought  your life; and the lord gave to our master the king punishment  of his enemies, as  this day, of Saul  your enemy, and of  his seed.

9. And David responded  to Rechab and  to Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As the lord lives, who ransomed  my soul from all affliction;

10. that the one reporting to me that Saul has died, and he was as one announcing good news before me, but I constrained him, and killed him in Ziklag, in which he must have thought to be giving me good news.

11. And now, [2men 1wicked] killed [2man 1a just] in  his house upon  his bed. And now, I will require  for his blood of your hand, and I will utterly destroy you from the earth.

12. And David gave charge to his servants, and they killed them, and lopped off  their hands and  their feet, and they hung them upon the fountain in Hebron. And the head of Ishbosheth they entombed in the tomb of Abner son of Ner in Hebron.  

## 2 Samuel 5

1.  David Is Anointed King over Israel And [5came 1all 2the 3tribes 4of Israel] to David in Hebron. And they say to him, Behold, we are of your bones and of your flesh.

2. And before yesterday and the third day before, Saul was king over us, you were the one leading out and bringing in  Israel. And [3said 1the 2 lord] to you, You tend  my people  Israel! and you will be for leader over  my people Israel.

3. And [5come 1all 2the 3elders 4of Israel] to the king in Hebron. And [3ordained 4with them  1king 2David] a covenant in Hebron, in the presence of the lord. And they anoint  David for king over all Israel.

4. [2was a son 3thirty 4years 1David] in  his reigning, and forty years he reigned.

5. Seven years and [2months 1six] he reigned in Hebron over Judah. And thirty three years he reigned over all Israel and Judah in Jerusalem.

6. And [3went forth 1the 2king], and all  his men unto Jerusalem, to the Jebusite  dwelling in the land. And it was said  to David, You shall not enter here. For [6opposed 1the 2blind 3and 4the 5lame], saying, [2shall not 3enter 1David] here.

7. And David overtook the citadel of Zion, this is the city  of David.

8. And David said in  that day, Every one striking a Jebusite, let him touch by the dagger both the lame, and the blind, and the ones detesting the soul of David! On account of this they shall say, Blind and lame shall not enter into the house of the lord.

9. And David stayed in the citadel, and this was called the city of David. And David built the city round about from the Akra, and  his house.

10. And David went along, going and being magnified, and the lord almighty was with him.

11. And [4sent 1Hiram 2king 3of Tyre] messengers to David, and wood of cedars, and fabricators of woods, and fabricators of stones, and they built a house  for David.

12. And David knew that [2prepared 3him 1the lord] for king over Israel, and that [2was lifted up  1his kingdom] on account of  his people Israel.

13. And David took again wives and concubines from Jerusalem, after  his coming from Hebron. And [5were born  6to David 1still more 2sons 3and 4daughters].

14. And these are the names of the ones being born of them in Jerusalem -- Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

15. and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Napheg, and Japhia,

16. and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet, and Elishua.

17. And [3heard 1the 2Philistines] that David was anointed king over Israel. And [4ascended 1all 2the 3Philistines] to seek  David. And David heard, and went down unto the citadel.

18. And the Philistines came and met in battle in the valley of the Titans.

19. And David asked of the lord, saying, Shall I ascend against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into  my hands? And the lord said to David, Ascend! for in delivering I will deliver the Philistines into  your hands. 

20.  David Smites the Philistines And David came from the upper breaches, and he smote them there. And David said, The lord cut through  my enemies before me, as he cuts through waters. On account of this [4is called 1the 2name  3of that place] Upper Breaches.

21. And they left behind there  their gods, and [2took 3them 1David] and the men  with him.

22. And [2proceeded 3yet again 1the Philistines]  to ascend, and they met in battle in the valley of the Titans.

23. And David asked through the lord. And the lord said, Do not ascend to meet them! turn from them! and you shall be at hand for them neighboring the Place of Weeping.

24. And it will be in  your hearing the sound of the rumbling from out of the Grove of the Weeping, then you shall go down to them; for then the lord shall go forth in front of you to strike in the battle of the Philistines.

25. And David did thus as [2gave charge 3to him 1the lord]. And he struck the Philistines from Gibeon unto of Gezer.  

## 2 Samuel 6

1.  David Leads an Expedition with the Ark And [2gathered 3again 1David] every young man of Israel -- thirty thousand.

2. And [2rose up 3and 4went 1David], and all the people  with him, and some of the rulers of Judah,  to lead from there the ark  of God, upon which [7is called upon 1the 2name 3of the 4 lord 5of the 6forces], the one sitting upon the cherubim upon it.

3. And they set the ark  of God upon [2wagon 1a new], and lifted it from out of the house of Abinadab, the one on the hill. And Uzzah and  his brethren, the sons of Abinadab, led the wagon with the ark.

4. And  his brethren went in front of the ark.

5. And David and all the sons of Israel played before the lord with instruments in accord, and with odes, and with lutes, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with pipes. 

6.  Uzzah Touches the Ark and Dies And they come unto the threshing-floor of Nachon, and Uzzah stretched out  his hand to the ark  of God to hold it. And he held it, for [3distracted it 1the 2calf].

7. And [2was enraged 3in anger 1the lord] with  Uzzah; and [2struck 3him 4there  1God] for the rashness; and he died there by the ark  of the lord before  God.

8. And David was depressed because of which the lord cut severance with  Uzzah. And he called  that place, Severance of Uzzah, until  this day.

9. And David feared the lord in  that day, saying, How shall [4enter 5to 6me 1the 2ark  3of God]?

10. And [2did not 3want 1David]  to turn aside to himself the ark of the covenant of the lord into the city of David. And [2turned off 3with it 1David] into the house of Obed Edom the Gittite.

11. And [5stayed 1the 2ark 3of the 4 lord] in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite [2months 1three]. And the lord blessed the entire  house of Obed Edom and all the things of his. 

12.  David Brings the Ark into Jerusalem And it was reported  to king David, saying, The lord blessed the house of Obed Edom, and all of his, because of the ark  of God. And David went and led the ark  of the lord from out of the house of Obed Edom into the city of David with gladness.

13. And there were with him the ones lifting the ark of the lord, seven companies of dancers, and [4for sacrifice 1a calf 2and 3lambs].

14. And David played music with instruments in accord in the presence of the lord. And  David was clothed in [2robe 1a special].

15. And David and all the house of Israel led the ark of the lord with a cry, and with the sound of a trumpet.

16. And it happened of the ark coming unto the city of David, that Michal daughter of Saul looked through the window, and she saw  king David dancing and playing music before the lord; and she treated him with contempt in  her heart.

17. And they carried in the ark of the lord, and put it aside in  its place, in the middle of the tent which [2pitched 3for it 1David]. And David offered whole burnt-offerings before the lord, and peace offerings.

18. And David completed offering the whole burnt-offerings, and the peace offerings; and he blessed the people in the name of the lord of the forces.

19. And he portioned to all the people among all the force  of Israel, from man unto woman, to each a biscuit of bread, and broiled meat, and a pancake from the frying pan. And [4went forth 1all 2the 3people] each to  his house. 

20.  Michal Raves at David And David returned  to bless  his house. And [5came forth 1Michal 2the 3daughter 4of Saul] to meet David, and she said, How was [4glorified 5today 1the 2king  3of Israel], who was uncovered today in the eyes of the girls  of his servants, as [2uncovers 3by uncovering 1one] of the ones dancing.

21. And David said to Michal, In the presence of the lord I will dance, who chose me over  your father, and over all  his house,  to place me in the lead over  his people  Israel; and I shall play and dance in the presence of the lord.

22. And I will be uncovered again thus, and I will be useless in your eyes, and with the girls of whom you said of me, I was not extolled.

23. And  Michal daughter of Saul did not have a child unto the day  of her dying.  

## 2 Samuel 7

1.  Nathan Speaks to David Regarding God's House And it came to pass when [3sat 1the 2king] in  his house, and the lord rested him round about from all  of his enemies;

2. that [3said 1the 2king] to Nathan the prophet, Behold, indeed, I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark  of God sits in the midst of the tent.

3. And Nathan said to the king, All as much as should be in  your heart, proceed and do! for the lord is with you.

4. And it came to pass in  that night, and [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Nathan, saying,

5. Go, and speak to  my servant David! Thus says the lord, You shall not build for me a house  for me to dwell in.

6. For I have not dwelt in a house from which day I led the sons of Israel out of Egypt, until  this day, for I was walking about in a lodging, in a tent.

7. In all the places which [3went 4by 1all  2Israel], have I in speaking spoke to one tribe  of Israel in which I gave charge to tend  my people Israel, saying, Why do you not build for me a house of cedar?

8. And now, thus you shall say to my servant David, Thus says the lord almighty. I took you from out of the haven of the sheep,  for you to be for leader over  my people  Israel.

9. And I was with you in all wheresoever you went, and I utterly destroyed all  your enemies from your face, and I made to you [2name 1a great], according to the name of the great ones of the ones upon the earth.

10. And I will establish a place  for my people Israel, and I will plant it, and they shall encamp by themselves, and shall not be anxious any longer. And [3shall not 4proceed 1the son 2of iniquity]  to humble them as from the beginning,

11. even from the days which I ordered judges over  my people Israel. And I will rest you from all  your enemies. And [2will report 3to you 1the lord] that [2a house 1he shall build] to you.

12. And it will be whenever [3should have been fulfilled  2days 1your], and you shall sleep with  your fathers, that I shall raise up  your seed after you, who will be from out of  your belly, and I shall prepare  his kingdom.

13. He shall build to me a house to my name, and I will erect  his throne unto into the eon.

14. I will be to him for father, and he will be to me for son. And if [3should come  2injustice 1his], then I shall reprove him by a rod of men, and by blows of the sons of men.

15.  But my mercy I will not remove from him, as I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from your face.

16. And [2shall be trustworthy  1your house], and  your kingdom unto the eon before me. And  your throne will be erected into the eon.

17. According to all  these words, and according to all  this vision, so spoke Nathan to David. 

18.  David's Prayer And [3entered  1king 2David] and sat before the lord, and said, Who am I, O my Lord, O lord? and what  is my house, that you love me for these things?

19. And it was reduced small before you, O my Lord, O lord, and you spoke about the house  of your servant for a far time. And is this the law  of man, O my Lord, O lord?

20. And what shall David add yet  to speak to you? And now you know  your servant, O my Lord, O lord.

21. Because of  your word, and because of  your servant, you have acted, and according to  your heart you have done all  this greatness, to make known to your servant;

22. so as  to magnify you, O my Lord, O lord. For there is none as you, and there is no God besides you among all in whom we heard with  our ears.

23. And what [3is as  4your people 5Israel 2nation 1other] in the earth? As [2guided 3it  1God]  to ransom to himself a people,  to establish your name for the executing greatness and grandeur,  for you to cast out from in front  of your people, whom you ransomed to yourself from out of Egypt, even nations and tents?

24. And you prepared for yourself  your people Israel for a people unto the eon. And you, O lord, became to them for God.

25. And now, O my Lord, O lord, the word which you spoke for  your servant, and for  his house, confirm it as trustworthy unto the eon! And as you spoke, do!

26. And now may [2be magnified  1your name] until the eon, saying,

27. The lord almighty,  God over  Israel. You uncovered the ear  of your servant, saying, [3a house 1I shall build 2for you]. On account of this [3found  2servant 1your]  his own heart  to pray to you  this prayer.

28. And now, O my Lord, O lord, you are  God, and  your words will be true, and you spoke [2concerning  3your servant  1these good things].

29. And now begin and bless the house  of your servant  to be into the eon before you! For you, O my Lord, O lord, spoke, and from  your blessing [4shall be blessed 1the 2house  3of your servant] into the eon.

3. And [3said 1the 2king], Is there left any man from the house of Saul, that I should perform with him an act of mercy of God? And Ziba said to the king, There still is a son to Jonathan being stricken of the feet.

## 2 Samuel 10

1.  Hanun Disgraces David's Servants And it came to pass after these things, that [5died 1the 2king 3of the sons 4of Ammon], and [3reigned 1Hanun 2his son] instead of him.

2. And David said, I will perform an act of kindness with Hanun son of Nahash, in which manner [2performed  1his father] an act of kindness with me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand  of his servants concerning  his father. And [4came 1the 2servants 3of David] into the land of the sons of Ammon.

3. And [5said 1the 2rulers 3of the sons 4of Ammon] to Hanun  their master, Is the reason for  David to glorify  your father before you that he sent to you comforters? or is it not however that they should search the city, and spy it; for  to survey it David sent  his servants to you?

4. And Hanun took the servants of David, and he shaved  their beards, and cut off  their uniforms in  half unto  their hips, and he sent them out.

5. And it was reported  to David concerning the men. And he sent to meet them, for [3were 1the 2men] dishonored exceedingly. And [3said 1the 2king], Stay in Jericho until  [3rise  2beards 1your], and you shall return.

6. And [4saw 1the 2sons 3of Ammon] that [4was disgraced 1the 2people 3of David], and [4sent 1the 2sons 3of Ammon], and they hired the Syrian of Beth-rehob, and the Syrian of Zoba -- twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah -- a thousand men, and the one of Tob -- twelve thousand men.

7. And David heard, and he sent  Joab and all the force of the mighty ones. 

8.  War with Syria and Ammon And [4came forth 1the 2sons 3of Ammon], and deployed for war by the door of the gate. And the Syrian Zoba, and Rehob, and IshTob, and Maacah were by themselves in the field.

10. And the rest of the people he put into the hand of Abishai  his brother. And they deployed right opposite the sons of Ammon.

11. And he said, If Syria should strengthen over me, then you shall be to me for deliverance. And if the sons of Ammon should be strengthened over you, then I will come  to deliver you.

12. Be manly! for we should be strengthened for  our people, and for the cities  of our God. And the lord will do  good in his eyes.

13. And Joab approached and  his people with him for war against Syria. And they fled from his face.

14. And the sons of Ammon beheld that Syria has fled. And they fled from the face of Abishai, and they entered into the city. And Joab returned from the sons of Ammon, and came unto Jerusalem.

15. And Syria beheld that it failed in front Israel; and they gathered together at the same place.

16. And Hadarezer sent, and gathered together the Syrian  from the other side of the river. And they came unto Helam. And Shobach the commander-in-chief  of Hadarezer was in front of them.

17. And it was reported  to David, and he gathered together all Israel, and he passed over the Jordan, and he came to Helam. And Syria deployed before David, and he waged war with him.

19. And [7beheld 1all 2the 3kings 4the 5servants 6of Hadarezer] that they failed in front of Israel. And they deserted after Israel, and they served them. And Syria feared  to yet again deliver the sons of Ammon.  

## 2 Samuel 11

1.  David and Bath-sheba And it came to pass in the turning of the year into the time of the departure of the kings for battle, that David sent  Joab and  his servants with him and all  Israel; and they utterly destroyed the sons of Ammon, and they besieged against Rabbah. And David stayed in Jerusalem.

2. And it came to pass towards evening, and David rose up from  his bed, and walked upon the roof of the house of the king. And he beheld from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was good  in appearance -- exceedingly.

3. And David sent and sought the woman. And they said said, Is not this Bath-sheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite?

4. And David sent messengers, and he took her; and he entered to her, and went to bed with her, and she was being set apart from her uncleanness. And she returned to  her house.

5. And [3conceived 1the 2woman]. And she sent and reported to David, and said, I am one conceiving.

6. And David sent to Joab, saying, Send to me  Uriah the Hittite! And Joab sent  Uriah to David.

7. And Uriah came and entered to him. And David asked for the peace of Joab, and for the peace of the people, and for the peace of the war.

8. And David said  to Uriah, Go down to  your house, even to wash  your feet! And Uriah went forth from the house of the king; and went forth after him a tribute from the king.

9. And Uriah went to bed by the door of the house of the king with all the servants  of his master; and he did not go down to  his house.

10. And they reported  to David, saying that, [2did not 3go down 1Uriah] to  his house. And David said to Uriah, [3not 5from 6a journey 2you 1Are 4come]? Why did you not go down to  your house?

11. And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, dwell in tents; and  my master Joab, and the man-servants  of my master [2upon 3the face 4of the 5field 1camp]; and shall I enter into  my house to eat and to drink and to go to bed with  my wife? By  your life, and by the life  of your soul, in no way shall I do  this thing.

12. And David said to  Uriah, Stay here also today! and tomorrow I will send you. And Uriah stayed in Jerusalem on  that day, and the next day.

13. And [2called 3him 1David]. And he ate before him, and drank. And he intoxicated him. And he went forth at evening  to go to bed upon  his bed with the servants  of his master, but [3unto  4his house 1he did not 2go down]. 

14.  Uriah Dies in Battle by Treachery And it became morning, and David wrote a scroll to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

15. And he wrote in the scroll, saying, Bring  Uriah right opposite the battle of the fortified part, and turn away from behind him! so that he shall be struck and shall die.

16. And it came to pass in  Joab's guarding at the city, that he put  Uriah into the place where he knew that men of power were there.

17. And [5came forth 1the 2men 3of the 4city], and waged war against Joab. And there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and [5died 6also 1even 2Uriah 3the 4Hittite].

18. And Joab sent and reported  to David all the matters of the battle.

19. And Joab gave charge to the messenger, saying, In  your completing all the matters of the battle speaking to the king,

20. that it shall be if [5ascends 1the 2rage 3of the 4king], and he should say to you, Why is it that you approached to the city to wage war? Did you not know that they would shoot from on top the wall?

21. Who struck  Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman toss a piece of millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thebez? Why did you lead forward to the wall? And you shall say, And also  your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.

22. And [4came 1the 2messenger 3of Joab] to the king in Jerusalem, and reported  to David all as much as Joab spoke.

23. And [3said 1the 2messenger] to David that, [3strengthened 4against 5us 1The 2men], and came forth against us into the field, and we came unto them unto the door of the gate.

24. And [3shot 1the ones 2shooting] unto  your servants from of the wall, and there died some of the servants of the king, and even  your subject Uriah the Hittite has died.

25. And David said to the messenger, Thus you shall say to Joab, Do not let [2be severe 3in 4your eyes  1this matter], for perhaps indeed it is thus one way, and perhaps thus another way [3devours 1that the 2broadsword]; strengthen  your battle against the city, and raze it, and strengthen against it.

26. And [4heard 1the 2wife 3of Uriah] that [3has died 1Uriah  2her husband], and she lamented over  her husband.

27. And [3went by 1the 2time of mourning], and David sent and brought her into  his house. And she became to him for a wife, and she bore to him a son. And [6wicked 5appeared 1the 2matter 3which 4David did] in the eyes of the lord.  

## 2 Samuel 12

1.  Nathan Confronts David And the lord sent Nathan the prophet to  David. And he entered to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city -- one rich and one needy.

2. And there was to the rich man flocks and herds -- many, exceedingly.

3. And to the needy there was not anything, but only [3ewe-lamb 1one 2small] which he acquired, and protected, and nourished it. And it matured with him, and with  his sons at the same time. [2from  3his bread 1It ate], and [2from  3his cup 1it drank], and [2in  3his bosom 1it slept], and it was to him as a daughter.

4. And [2came 1a traveller] to the [2man  1rich]. And he spared  to take from  his flock, and from  his herd,  to prepare for the stranger coming to him. And he took the ewe-lamb of the [2man  1needy]; and he prepared it for the man  coming to him.

5. And [2was enraged 3in anger 1David] exceedingly against the man. And he said to Nathan, As the lord lives, that [4is a son 5of death  1man  2doing 3this].

6. And for the ewe-lamb he shall pay four-fold, because he did  this thing, and for which he did not spare.

7. And Nathan said to David, You are the man, the one doing this thing. Thus says the lord  God of Israel, I anointed you for king over  Israel, and I rescued you from out of the hand of Saul.

8. And I gave to you the house  of your master, and the wives  of your master into  your bosom, and I gave to you the house of Israel and Judah. And if [2little 3to you 1it is], I would have added to you as those. 

9.  Judgment Pronounced on David Why is it that you treated as worthless the word of the lord,  to do the wicked thing in his eyes? Uriah the Hittite you struck by the broadsword, and  his wife you took to yourself for wife, and him you killed by the broadsword of the sons of Ammon.

10. And now, [2shall not 3depart 1the broadsword] from  your house unto the eon. Because of this, for you treated me with contempt, and took the wife  of Uriah the Hittite  to be to you for a wife.

11. Thus says the lord, Behold, I shall awaken [2against 3you 1evils] from out of  your house, and I shall take  your wives before your eyes, and I will give them to your neighbor, and he shall go to bed with  your wives before  this sun.

12. For you did it secretly, but I will do  this thing before all Israel, and before  this sun.

13. And David said  to Nathan, I have sinned against the lord. And Nathan said to David, And the lord cast aside  your sin, and you shall not die.

14. Except that, in provoking to anger, you provoked to anger the enemies of the lord in  this thing, and indeed  your son, the one born to you, to death he will die.

15. And Nathan went forth to  his house. And the lord enfeebled the child which [3bore  1the wife 2of Uriah]  unto David, and he was ill.

16. And David sought  God for the boy. And David fasted with fasting, and he entered and lodged upon the ground.

17. And [4rose up 1the 2elders  3of his house] to him,  to raise him from the ground, and he did not want, and he would not eat bread with them.

18. And it came to pass in  [3day 1the 2seventh], and [3died 1the 2boy]. And [4feared 1the 2servants 3of David] to announce to him that, [3has died 1The 2boy]. For they said, Behold, while the  boy was still living, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to  our voice. And how should we say to him that, [3has died 1The 2boy]. For he shall do bad things.

19. And David perceived that  his servants were whispering, and David comprehended that [3has died 1the 2boy]. And David said to  his servants, Has [3died 1the 2boy]? And they said, He has died.

20. And David rose up from the ground, and bathed, and anointed himself, and changed  his clothes. And he entered into the house  of God, and did obeisance to him. And he entered unto  his house, and asked for bread to eat. And they placed near him bread, and he ate.

21. And [2said  1his servants] to him, What is  this thing which you do because of the boy? While still living you fasted, and wept, and were sleepless; and when [3died 1the 2boy] you rose up and ate bread and drank?

22. And David said, While  the boy was still living, I fasted and wept. For I said, Who knows if [2will show mercy 3on me 1the lord], and [3shall live 1the 2boy]?

23. And now he has died, why this that I fast? I shall not be able  to return him, yet I will go to him, but he shall not return to me. 

24.  Birth of Solomon And David comforted  his wife Bath-sheba. And he entered to her, and went to bed with her, and she conceived, and gave birth to a son, and called  his name Solomon. And the lord loved him.

25. And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and called  his name Jedidiah, by the word of the lord.

26. And Joab waged war with Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and he overtook the city of the kingdom.

27. And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I waged war against Rabbah, and overtook the city  of waters.

28. And now, gather together the rest of the people, and camp upon the city, and be the first to take it! that [2should not 3be the first to take 1I] the city, and [2should be called  1my name] upon it.

29. And David gathered together all the people, and he went to Rabbah, and waged war against it, and overtook it.

30. And he took the crown  of their king from  his head. And  its weight was a talent of gold, and [2stone 1of precious]. And it was upon the head of David. And [4spoils 5of the 6city 1he brought forth 3much 2exceedingly].

31. And the people, the one in it, he led out and put them to the saw, and to the threshing-machines  of iron, and adz of iron. And he led them through the brick-kiln. And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David returned and all the people to Jerusalem.  

## 2 Samuel 13

1.  Amnon Abases Tamar And it happened after these things, that there was to Absalom, son of David, a sister good to the sight, exceedingly. And her name was Tamar, and [4loved 5her 1Amnon 2son 3of David].

2. And Amnon was afflicted so as to be ill over Tamar  his sister, for [2a virgin 1she was], and it was an enormous thing in the eyes of Amnon  to do anything to her.

3. And there was  a companion to Amnon, and his name was Jonadab son of Shimeah the brother of David. And Jonadab was [2practical 1exceedingly].

4. And he said to him, What is it to you that thus you are weak morning by morning, O son of the king? Will you not report it to me? And [2said 3to him 1Amnon], Tamar, the sister  of my brother Absalom, I love.

5. And [2said 3to him 1Jonadab], Go to bed in  your bed, and be as infirm! and [2will enter  1your father]  to see you. And you shall say to him, Let [4come 1indeed 2Tamar  3my sister] and feed me! and let her make [2before 3my eyes 1food]! so that I should see, and eat from  her hand.

6. And Amnon went to bed, and became as ill. And [3entered 1the 2king] to see him. And Amnon said to the king, Let [4come 1indeed 2Tamar  3my sister] to me! and let her bake [3before 4my eyes 1two 2biscuits]! and I will eat from  her hand.

7. And David sent for Tamar to the house, saying, Go indeed to the house of Amnon  your brother, and make food for him!

8. And Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother. And with him being in bed, that she took the dough and mixed it, and made biscuits before his eyes, and baked the biscuits.

9. And she took the frying pan, and emptied it before him, and he did not want to eat. And Amnon said, Lead out every man from about me! And they led out every man about him.

10. And Amnon said to Tamar, Carry in to me the food to the bedroom! and I shall eat from out of  your hand. And Tamar took the biscuits which she made, and carried them to Amnon her brother, into the bedroom.

11. And she brought to him  to eat. And he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, go to bed with me my sister!

12. And she said to him, No, O my brother, you should not abase me, for it shall not be done so in Israel. You should not do  this folly.

13. And I, where shall I carry away  my scorn? And you will be as one of the fools in Israel. And now, speak indeed to the king! for in no way will he restrain me from you.

14. And [2did not 3want 1Amnon]  to hear  her voice. And he powered over her, and abased her, and went to bed with her.

15. And [2detested 3her 1Amnon] with an [3hatred 2great 1exceedingly]; for so great was the hatred which he detested her, that it was above the love which he loved her. And [2said 3to her 1Amnon], Rise up and go!

16. And [2said 3to him 1Tamar] that, Great is the [2evil  1last] over the first which you do with me,  to send me away. And [2did not 3want 1Amnon] to hearken to  her voice.

17. And he called  his servant  set over  his house, and said to him, Send indeed this one from me outside, and lock the door after her!

18. And upon her was an inner garment with long sleeves, for thus [5dressed 1the 2daughters 3of the 4king], the virgins, the ones with their outer garments. And [3led 4her  2minister 1his] outside, and locked the door after her.

19. And Tamar took ashes, and put them upon  her head. And the inner garment, the one with long sleeves, the one upon her, she tore; and she put  her hands upon  her head, and she went going and crying out.

20. And [3said 4to her 1Absalom  2her brother], Has Amnon  your brother been with you? And now my sister be silent! for [2is your brother 1he]. Do not put it to  your heart to say anything! And Tamar sat expiring in the house of Absalom  her brother.

21. And  king David heard all  these words, and was enraged exceedingly.

22. And [2did not 3speak 1Absalom] with Amnon of bad or good, for Absalom detested  Amnon for which he abased Tamar  his sister.

23. And it came to pass after two whole years of days, that they were shearing for Absalom in Baal-hazor, the one by Ephraim. And Absalom called all the sons of the king.

24. And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold indeed, [2shears  1your servant]. Let [4go 1indeed 2the 3king], and  his servants with  your servant.

25. And [3said 1the 2king] to Absalom, No indeed, O my son, in no way should we all go ourselves, and in no way should we be burdensome upon you. And Absalom constrained him, and the king did not want  to go, but he blessed him.

26. And Absalom said, And if not, let [3go 4indeed 5with 6us 1Amnon  2my brother]! And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], Why should he go with you?

27. And [2constrained 3him 1Absalom], and he sent with him  Amnon, and all the sons of the king. 

28.  Absalom Kills Amnon And Absalom gave charge to his servants, saying, Behold, when ever [4feels good 1the 2heart 3of Amnon] with the wine, and I should say to you, Strike  Amnon and put him to death! you should not fear. For is it not I  giving charge to you? Be manly and become as sons of power!

29. And [4did 1the 2servants 3of Absalom]  to Amnon as he gave charge to them. And [6rose up 1all 2the 3sons 4of the 5king], and [2mounted 1each] upon  his mule, and they fled.

30. And it came to pass of their being in the way, that the report came to David saying, Absalom struck all the sons of the king, and did not leave behind of them not even one.

31. And [3rose up 1the 2king], and tore  his clothes, and laid upon the ground. And all  his servants  standing around him tore  their clothes.

32. And [6answered 1Jonadab 2son 3of Shimeah 4brother 5of David] and said, Let not [4say  1my master 2the 3king] that all the boys of the sons of the king he put to death! but only Amnon alone died, for by the mouth of Absalom it was situated to be from the day of which he abased Tamar  his sister.

33. And now, let not [4put  1my master 2the 3king] [2upon  3his heart 1the matter]! saying that, All the sons of the king died; for only Amnon alone died.

34. And Absalom ran away. And [4lifted 1the 2servant  3watchman]  his eyes and looked. And behold, [2people 1there were many] going in the way behind him from out of the side of the mountain.

35. And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the sons of the king are at hand; according to the word  of your servant, thus it has happened.

36. And it came to pass when he completed speaking, that behold, the sons of the king came and lifted up  their voice and wept. And indeed the king and all  his servants wept [3weeping 2great 1an exceedingly].

37. And Absalom ran away, and he went to Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [3mourned 1the 2king] over  his son all the days.

38. And Absalom fled and went forth unto Geshur, and he was there [2years 1three].

39. And [5abated 1the 2spirit  3of king 4David]  to go forth unto Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, that he died.  

## 2 Samuel 14

1.  Joab's Plan to Return Absalom And [4knew 1Joab 2son 3of Zeruiah] that the heart of the king was towards Absalom.

2. And Joab sent to Tekoah, and he took from there [2woman 1a wise]. And he said to her, You mourn indeed, and put on [2garments 1mournful], and do not anoint yourself with oil, and be as a woman [3days 2for many 1mourning] for one having died!

3. And you shall come to the king, and you shall speak to him according to  this thing. And Joab put the words into  her mouth.

4. And [3entered 1the 2Tekoahite woman] to the king, and she fell upon her face to the ground, and she did obeisance to him. And she said, Deliver, O king, deliver!

5. And [3said 4to 5her 1the 2king], What to you is it?  And she said, By all means [4woman 3a widow 1I 2am], and [2died  1my husband].

6. And indeed to your maidservant are two sons, and they [2quarreled 1both] in the field, and there was no one  for rescuing between them, and [3hit 1the 2one]  [2one 3brother 1his], and killed him.

7. And behold, [4rose up 2entire 1the 3family] against  your maidservant, and they said, Give over the one hitting  his brother, and we shall kill him, on account of the life  of his brother whom he killed; and we shall take away the heir. And so they shall extinguish  my spark of coal, the one being left behind to me, so as to not establish to my husband a vestige and name upon the face of the earth.

8. And [3said 1the 2king] to the woman, Go to  your house being in health! and I will take charge concerning you.

9. And [4said  3woman 1the 2Tekoahite] to the king, O my master, O king, upon me be the iniquity, and upon the house  of my father! and the king and  his throne be innocent!

10. And [3said 1the 2king], The one speaking to you a word, lead him to me! and in no way shall anyone proceed yet to touch you.

11. And [3said 1the 2woman], Let now [3remember 4indeed 1the 2king] the lord your God! to multiply a relative for blood  to utterly destroy, and in no way take away  my son. And he said, As the lord lives, there shall not fall of the hair  of your son upon the ground.

12. And [3said 1the 2woman], Let [2speak 3indeed  1your maidservant] to  my master the king a thing! And he said, Speak!

13. And [3said 1the 2woman], Why have you imputed thus upon the people of God? Yes, by  [3speaking 1the 2king]  this word it is as a trespass,  [3to not 4return 1for the 2king] the one being thrust away by him.

14. For to death we shall die, and as the water  being discharged upon the earth, not being gathered together; that [2not 1God shall] take the life; yet he himself devises a device to not thrust away from him the one being thrusted away.

15. And now for which I came to speak to [2the 3king  1my master]  this word, for [3see 4me 1the 2people]; and [3will say  2maidservant 1your], Let [2speak 3indeed  1your maidservant] to  my master the king, if by any means [3shall do 1the 2king] the matter  of his maidservant;

16. for [3shall hear 1the 2king] to rescue  his maidservant from out of the hand of the man  seeking to take me away, and  my son, from the inheritance of God.

17. And said  your maidservant, Let indeed the word  of my master the king be as an accepted sacrifice. For as a messenger of God, thus is  my master the king,  to hear the good and the bad; and the lord  your God will be with you.

18. And [3answered 1the 2king] and said to the woman, You should not indeed hide from me the matter which ever I shall ask you. And [3said 1the 2woman], Let [5speak 1indeed  2my master 3the 4king]!

19. And [3said 1the 2king], Is not the hand of Joab in all this with you? And [3answered 4and 5said 1the 2woman] to the king, As [2lives  1your soul], O my master, O king, since there is no turning to the right or to the left of all which [4spoke  1my master 2the 3king], for  your servant Joab himself gave charge to me, and he put [3in 4the 5mouth  6of your maidservant 1all  2these words].

20. So as for  [4to come about 1the 2face  3of this matter], [3prepared  2your servant 1Joab]  this thing. And  my master the king is wise as the wisdom of a messenger  of God,  to know all the things in the land.

21. And [3said 1the 2king] to Joab, Behold, indeed I do to you according to  [2your word 1this]. Go return the young man  Absalom!

22. And Joab fell upon his face upon the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king. And Joab said, Today [2knows  1your servant] that he found favor in your eyes, O my master, O king, for [4did  1my master 2the 3king] the matter  for his servant. 

23.  Absalom Returns to Jerusalem And Joab rose up and went into Geshur, and he led  Absalom into Jerusalem.

24. And [3said 1the 2king], Let him return to  his house, but  [3my face 1let him not 2see]! And Absalom returned to  his house, but the face of the king he did not see.

25. And [3as 4Absalom 1there was no 2man] in all Israel as [2praiseworthy 1exceedingly]. From the sole of his foot and unto the top of his head -- there was not [2on 3him 1a blemish].

26. And in  his shearing  his head, and it took place at the end of days unto days that he sheared it, for it became burdensome upon him; and shearing, he set aside the hair  of his head two hundred shekels of the [2scale-weight  1royal].

27. And there was born to  Absalom three sons and [2daughter 1one], and her name was Tamar, she was [3woman 2goodly 1an exceedingly].

28. And Absalom stayed in Jerusalem two years of days, and the face of the king he did not see.

29. And Absalom sent for Joab  to send him to the king, and he did not want to come to him. And he sent again the second time to him, and he did not want to come. 

30.  Absalom Burns Joab's Field And Absalom said to  his servants, You know the portion in the field  of Joab being next to mine, and to him is barley there. You go and burn it by fire! And [4burned 1the 2servants 3of Absalom] by fire the portion of the field of Joab.

31. And Joab rose up, and came to Absalom, to the house, and said to him, Why did [2set on fire  1your servants]  my field with fire?

32. And Absalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here! And I will send you to the king, saying, Why did I come from out of Geshur? [2good 3for me 1It was]  to be there. And now, I shall see indeed the face of the king, and if there is [2in 3me 1iniquity] then I shall be killed.

33. And Joab went to the king, and reported to him. And he called  Absalom, and he entered to the king, and he did obeisance to him and fell upon his face upon the ground before the king. And [3kissed 1the 2king]  Absalom.  

## 2 Samuel 15

1.  Absalom Appoints Himself as Judge And it came to pass after these things, that [2prepared 3for himself 1Absalom] chariots, and horsemen, and fifty men to run along in front of him.

2. And [2rose early 1Absalom], and stood at the way of the gate. And it came to pass every man in which had a case, and came to the king for a judgment, that [2called 3him 1Absalom], and said to him, From out of of what city are you? And he said, [2is from 3one 4of the 5tribes 6of Israel  1your servant].

3. And [2said 3to 4him  1Absalom], Behold,  your words are good and well-tempered; but  [3hearing 2no one 1there is] you from the king.

4. And Absalom said, Why shall he not place me for judge in the land, and [4to 5me 3shall come 1every 2man] to whom ever there might be a dispute, and a case, and I will do justice for him.

5. And it came to pass when the [2approached 1man]  to do obeisance to him, that he stretched out  his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.

6. And Absalom did according to  this thing to all Israel, to the ones coming for a judgment to the king. And Absalom adopted the heart of the men of Israel.

7. And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to  his father, I will go indeed and pay  my vows which I vowed to the lord in Hebron.

8. For [4a vow 3vowed  2servant 1your] in  my living in Geshur in Syria, saying, If in returning [3shall return 4me 1the 2 lord] to Jerusalem, then I will serve to the lord.

9. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], Proceed in peace! And rising up he went unto Hebron.

10. And Absalom sent spies into all the tribes  of Israel, saying, In  your hearing the sound of the trumpet, that you shall say, [2reigns 1Absalom] in Hebron.

11. And [4went 5with 6Absalom 1two hundred 3men 7from out of 8Jerusalem 2chosen]; and they went in simplicity, and they did not know not one thing.

12. And Absalom sent and called  Ahithophel the Gilonite, counselor to David, from out of  his city  Giloh, during  his sacrificing the sacrifices. And there was [2confederation 1a strong]. And the people went, and it multiplied with Absalom.

13. And one came  reporting to David, saying, [5is committed 1The 2heart 3of the men 4of Israel] after Absalom. 

14.  David Flees from Absalom And David said to all  his servants with him in Jerusalem, Rise up! for we should flee, for there is no deliverance for us from the face of Absalom. Hasten  to go! that he should not hasten and overtake us, and thrust [2upon 3us  1evil], and should strike the city by the mouth of the broadsword.

15. And [5said 1the 2servants 3of the 4king] to the king, According to all as much as seems good  to our master the king, behold,  we are your servants.

16. And [3went forth 1the 2king], and all  his house  on their feet. And [3left 1the 2king] ten women  of his concubines  to guard the house.

17. And [3went forth 1the 2king], and all  his people by foot. And they set up in a house  far away.

18. And all  his servants [2by 3his hand 1passed]. And every  Cherethite, and every  Pelethite, and all the Gittites -- six hundred men  having come from out of Gath by foot, were passing in front of the king.

19. And [3said 1the 2king] to Ittai the Gittite, Why should you go even yourself with us? Return and live with the king! For you are an alien yourself, and because you are displaced from out of  your place.

20. Since [2yesterday 1you came], then today shall I move you  to go with us? And I shall go where ever I shall go. Go, and return  your brothers with you! and the lord shall execute with you an act of kindness and truth.

21. And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the lord lives, and as [4lives  1my master 2the 3king], that unto the place where ever [4might be  1my master 2the 3king], and if unto death, or if unto life, that there [2will be  1your servant].

22. And David said to Ittai, Go, and pass over with me! And [4went 1Ittai 2the 3Gittite], and all the men, the ones with him, and all  his servants.

23. And all the land wept [2voice 1with a great]. And all the people passed through the rushing stream of the Kidron. And the king passed over the rushing stream Kidron. And all the people came unto the face of the way of the wilderness. 

24.  Zadok and Abiathar And behold, also indeed Zadok and all the Levites were with him lifting the ark of the covenant of God. And they stationed the ark  of God. And Abiathar ascended until [4ceased 1all 2the 3people] going out of the city.

25. And [3said 1the 2king] to Zadok, Return the ark  of God unto the city! If I should find favor in the eyes of the lord, and he returns me, then he shall show it to me, and  its beauty.

26. And if he should say thus, I have no want in you; behold, I, I let him do to me the pleasing thing before him.

27. And [3said 1the 2king]  to Zadok the priest, Behold, you return to the city in peace, and Ahimaaz  your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, the two sons of yours with you!

28. Behold, I wait for you in the wilderness of the desert until the coming of a word by you  to report to me.

29. And [4returned 1Zadok 2and 3Abiathar] the ark  of God to Jerusalem, and it stayed there.

30. And David ascended upon the ascent of the olive groves, ascending and weeping, and  his head being covered over, and he went barefoot. And all the people, the one with him, [3covered 1each 2man]  his head. And they ascended -- ascending and weeping.

31. And it was announced to David, saying, And Ahithophel is among the ones confederating with Absalom. And David said, O lord  my God, efface indeed the counsel of Ahithophel!

32. And David was coming unto  Ros, where he did obeisance there  to God. And behold, [5was come 6for 7meeting 8him 1Hushai 2the 3chief friend 4of David], tearing  his inner garment, with earth upon  his head.

33. And [2said 3to him 1David], If you should go through with me, then you will be unto me a load.

34. If into the city you should return, then you shall say  to Absalom, [2your servant 1I am], O king, allow me to live! [2a servant  3of your father 1for I was] then and just now, and now I am your servant. And by saying this efface to me the counsel of Ahithophel!

35. And behold, there are with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests. And it will be every word which ever you should hear from out of the house of the king, that you shall report it  to Zadok and  Abiathar the priests.

36. Behold, [6there 4are with 5them 2two 3sons 1their], Ahimaaz  son of Zadok, and Jonathan son  of Abiathar. And you shall send by their hand to me every word which ever you should hear.

37. And [5entered 2the 3friend 1Hushai 4of David] into the city, and Absalom at present entered into Jerusalem.  

## 2 Samuel 16

1.  Ziba Misleads David And David went through a little way from  Ros. And behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth arrived for meeting him, and a pair of donkeys being saddled, and upon them two hundred bread loaves, and an ephah of dried grape clusters, and a hundred dried fruit clusters, and a skin flask of wine.

2. And [3said 1the 2king] to Ziba, What are these to you? And Ziba said, The donkeys for the household of the king  to mount, and the bread loaves, and the dried fruit clusters, and dried grapes for food to the servants, and the wine to drink to the one faint in the wilderness.

3. And [3said 1the 2king], Where is the son  of your master? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he sits in Jerusalem, for he said, Today [4shall return 5to me 1the 2house 3of Israel] the kingdom  of my father.

4. And [3said 1the 2king]  to Ziba, Behold, I give to you all as much as is Mephibosheth's. And Ziba said, I do obeisance, may I find favor in your eyes, O my master, O king. 

5.  Shimei Curses David And [3came  1king 2David] until Bahurim. And behold, from there a man came forth from the family of the house of Saul, and the name to him was Shimei, son of Gera. He came forth coming and cursing,

6. and throwing stones at  David, and at all the servants  of king David. And all the people, and all the mighty ones of the right and of the left of the king.

7. And thus Shimei said in  his cursing, Go forth! go forth! O man of the blood sheddings, and O man the lawbreaker.

8. [2returned 3upon 4you 1The lord] all the blood of the house of Saul, because you reigned instead of him. And the lord gave the kingdom into the hand of Absalom  your son. And behold, you are taken in  your own evil, for [2are a man 3of blood 1you].

9. And [4said 1Abishai 2son 3of Zeruiah] to the king, Why [4curse  3dog  2dying 1does this]  my master the king? Let me pass indeed! and I shall remove  his head.

10. And [3said 1the 2king] to Abishai, What is it to me and to you, sons of Zeruiah? Even leave him, and thus let him curse! For the lord said to him to curse  David. And who shall say to him, Why did you do thus?

11. And David said to Abishai, and to all  his servants, Behold,  my son, the one coming forth from out of  my belly, seeks  my life. And moreover, now the son of the Benjamite. Leave him to curse! for [2told 3him 1the lord].

12. If by any means the lord may behold in  my humiliation, and shall return good to me for  his curse  this day -- so be it!

13. And David went, and all  his men in the way; and Shimei went according to the side of the mountain, being next to him -- he went, and cursed, and cast stones on him, and  [2dust 1strewing].

14. And [3went 1the 2king], and all the people with him being faint; and they refreshed there.

15. And Absalom, and every man of Israel entered into Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.

16. And it came to pass when [5came 1Hushai 2the 3chief friend 4of David] to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, As lives the king! As lives the king!

17. And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this  your act of kindness with  your companion? Why did you not go with  your companion?

18. And Hushai said to  Absalom, No, but following after whoever the lord chooses, and  this people, and every man of Israel. [2serving to him I will be] and [2with 3him 1I shall sit down].

19. And  secondly, to whom shall I serve? Should I not serve before  his son? Just as I served before  your father, so I will be before you. 

20.  Absalom Disgraces David And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give [2for yourselves 1counsel] what we should do.

21. And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Enter to the concubines  of your father! which he left behind to guard  his house. And [3shall hear 1all 2Israel] that you disgraced  your father, and [7shall grow in strength 1the 2hands 3of all 4the ones 5with 6you].

22. And they pitched the tent  of Absalom upon the roof, and Absalom entered to the concubines  of his father, in the eyes of all  Israel.

23. And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he consulted in the [2days  1first], was in which manner as if he should ask anything by the word  of God; thus was all the counsel  of Ahithophel, both to David and to Absalom.  

## 2 Samuel 17

1.  Absalom Prepares for War against David And Ahithophel said to Absalom, I shall choose indeed for myself twelve thousand men, and I shall rise up and pursue after David  at night.

2. And I shall come upon him, and he will be tiring and loosening his hand, and I shall startle him, and [6shall flee 1all 2the 3people  4with 5him], and I shall strike the king alone.

3. And I shall return all the people to you, in which manner [2returns 1a bride] to  her husband. Besides [3the life 5man 4of one 1you 2seek], and all the people will be at peace.

4. And [3was pleasing 1the 2word] in the eyes of Absalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.

5. And Absalom said, Call indeed  Hushai the Archite, and I shall hear what is in  his mouth, and indeed of him.

6. And Hushai entered to Absalom. And Absalom said to him, saying, According to  this thing Ahithophel spoke. Shall we do according to  his word? But if not you speak!

7. And Hushai said to Absalom, It is not good, this  counsel which Ahithophel counseled  this one time.

8. And Hushai said, You know  your father, and  his men, that [3mighty 1they are 2exceedingly], and [2is very bitter  1their soul] as a bear being made childless in the plain. And  your father is [2man 1a warrior], and in no way shall he rest the people.

9. For behold he now hides in one of the canyons, or in one of the places. And it will be when they fall upon them at the beginning, that one shall hear the hearing, and should say, There was a devastation among the people, to the one following after Absalom.

10. And indeed any son of power whose  heart is as the heart  of a lion, in melting away he shall melt away, for [3knows 1all 2Israel] that [2is mighty  1your father] and the sons of power, all the ones with him.

11. Thus advising, I advised. And [3in gathering together 4shall gather together 5unto 6you 1all 2Israel], from Dan and unto Beer-sheba, as the sand  upon the sea in multitude. And  your presence shall be going in the midst of them.

12. And we shall come upon him in one of the places, which ever we should find him there. And we shall camp upon him as falls the dew upon the ground. And we shall not leave behind among to him, and  of his men  with him, even indeed one.

13. And if [2into 3the 4city 1he should gather], then [3shall take 1all 2Israel] [2against  3that city 1lines], and drag it apart unto  the rushing stream, unto not leaving behind there neither a stone.

14. And Absalom said, and every man of Israel, [6is good 1The 2counsel 3of Hushai 4the 5Archite] over the counsel of Ahithophel. And the lord gave charge  to efface the [2counsel  3of Ahithophel  1good], so that the lord should bring the bad things upon Absalom.

15. And Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, So and so advised Ahithophel  to Absalom, and to the elders of Israel, and so and so I advised. 

16.  David Is Warned of Absalom's Plans And now send quickly and report  to David! saying, You should not lodge the night according to the descent of the wilderness, but by passing over, pass over! so that [3should not 4be swallowed down 1the 2king], and all the people, the one with him.

17. And Jonathan and Ahimaaz stopped at the spring of Rogel. And came forth the maidservant, and she reported to them. And they went and reported  to king David, for they were not able to appear  to enter into the city.

18. And [2beheld 3them 1a young man], and he reported to Absalom. And [3went 1the 2two] quickly, and they entered into a house of a man in Bahurim, and unto his cistern in the courtyard, and they went down there.

19. And [2took  1a woman] and opened and spread out  a covering over the mouth of the cistern. And she cooled [2upon 3it 1dried clusters], and they did not know the thing.

20. And [4came 1the 2servants 3of Absalom] to the woman, into the house, and they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And [3said 4to them 1the 2woman], They went for a little  water. And they sought and did not find them, and they returned unto Jerusalem.

21. And it came to pass, after  their going forth, they ascended from out of the cistern, and went, and reported  to king David. And they say to him, Rise up and pass over [3quickly 1the 2water]! for thus [2has counseled 3against 4you 1Ahithophel].

22. And David rose up, and all the people  with him, and they passed over the Jordan until the light of the morning, until one was not unaware of who did not pass over the Jordan.

23. And Ahithophel knew that he had not taken  his counsel, and he saddled  his donkey, and rose up, and went forth to  his house in  his city. And he gave charge to his household, and he hung himself, and died. And they entombed him in the burying-place  of his father.

24. And David went through unto Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and every man of Israel with him. 

25.  Amasa Is Placed over the Force of Abasalom And  [3Amasa 2placed 1Absalom] instead of Joab over the force. And Amasa was a son of a man, and the name to him was Ithra the Israelite. This one entered to Abigail, daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab.

26. And Absalom camped and all Israel in the land of Gilead.

27. And it came to pass when David entered into Mahanaim, that Shobi son of Nahash, from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,

28. brought beds, and spreads, and kettles, and [2utensils 1ceramic], and wheat, and barley, and flour, and beans, and lentils and toasted grain,

29. and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese from oxen. And they brought near  to David, and to the people  with him to eat; for they said, The people are hungering, and fainting, and thirsting, in the wilderness.  

## 2 Samuel 18

1.  Leaders of David's Forces And David numbered all the people  with him. And he placed over them commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds.

2. And David sent away the people,  a third under the hand of Joab, and  another third under the hand of Abishai son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, and  other third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And [3said 1the 2king] to the people, In going forth, I shall go forth even indeed I myself with you.

3. And [3said 1the 2people], You shall not go forth; for if [2into exile 1we should flee], they shall not put  us to heart. And if [3should die  1half 2of us] they shall not put  us to heart. For you are as of us ten thousand. And now it is good that you will be with us in the city for our helper.

4. And [3said 4to 5them 1the 2king], The pleasing thing before you I will do. And [3stood 1the 2king] by the side of the gate, and all the people went forth by hundreds and by thousands.

5. And [3gave charge 1the 2king] to Joab and to Abishai and to Ittai, saying, Spare for me the young man  Absalom! And all the people heard [3giving charge 1the 2king] to all the rulers concerning Absalom.

6. And [4went forth 1all 2the 3people] into the field for meeting  Israel. And [3happened 1the 2battle] in the grove of Ephraim.

7. And [4failed 5there 1the 2people 3of Israel] before the children of David. And there became  [2devastation 1a great] in  that day -- twenty thousand men.

8. And it came to pass there the war dispersed over the face of all the land. And [3was superabundant 1the 2forest]  in devouring of the people above what [3devoured 1the 2sword] among the people  in that day.

9. And Absalom met before the servants of David. And Absalom was mounted upon the mule, and [3was entering 1the 2mule] under the thicket of the [2oak  1great]. And [2was twisted  1his head] in the oak, and he hung between the heaven and between the earth, and the mule underneath him went on.

10. And [3saw it 2man 1one], and announced  to Joab. And said, Behold, I have seen  Absalom hanging in the oak.

11. And Joab said to the man  announcing to him, And behold, you saw it? And why is it that you did not strike him there to the ground, and I would have given to you ten shekels of silver, and [2sash 1one]?

12. [4said 1And 2the 3man] to Joab, And if you rendered unto  my hands a thousand shekels of silver, in no way would I put  my hand against the son of the king. For in  our ears [3gave charge 1the 2king] to you, and to Abishai, and to Ittai, saying, Guard for me the young man  Absalom,

13. to not do [2against  3his life 1anything injust]! And all the matter will not be kept unaware from the king, and you shall set yourself right opposite me. 

14.  Joab Kills Absalom And Joab said, This I begin; not thus shall I abide before you. And Joab took three arrows in  his hand, and he stuck them in the heart of Absalom while yet he was living, in the heart of the oak.

15. And there encircled ten young men lifting the weapons of Joab, and they struck  Absalom, and killed him.

16. And Joab trumped with the trumpet, and [3returned 1the 2people]  to not pursue after Israel, for Joab spared the people.

17. And Joab took  Absalom, and he tossed him into [2chasm 1a great] in the grove, into the [2pit  1great], and they set over him a heap [3stones 2great 1of exceedingly]. And all Israel fled each to  his tent.

18. And Absalom while still living took and set for himself a monument in the valley of the king. For he said, There is not to me a son calling to mind  my name. And he called the monument by  his name. And he named it Hand of Absalom, until  this day.

19. And Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, Running indeed, I will announce good news to the king, that [2passed judgment 3to him 1the lord] on the hand  of his enemies.

20. And [2said 3to him 1Joab], [3not 4a man 5of good news 2are 1You] in  this day, but you shall announce good news in [2day 1another]. But in  this day you shall not announce good news, for a son of the king has died.

21. And Joab said to Cushi, Go, announce to the king what you have seen! And Cushi did obeisance to  Joab, and he ran.

22. And [4added 5still 1Ahimaaz 2son 3of Zadok], and he said to Joab, Also let it be that I run also indeed myself after  Cushi! And Joab said, Why do you run, my young one? There is not [2to you 1good news] for benefit in going.

23. And Ahimaaz said, For what if I shall run? And [2said 3to him 1Joab], Run! And Ahimaaz ran by the way  of Kechar, and he surpassed  Cushi.

24. And David was sitting between the two gates, and [3went 1the 2watchman] onto the roof of the gate house, unto the wall; and he lifted  his eyes and saw, and behold, there was a man running alone before him.

25. And [3yelled out 1the 2watchman], and reported to the king. And [3said 1the 2king], If he is alone good news is in  his mouth. And he went along, coming and approaching.

26. And [3saw 1the 2watchman 5man 4another] running. And [3yelled out 1the 2watchman] at the gate, and said, Behold, [2man 1another] is running alone. And [3said 1the 2king], Also this one [2announcing good news 1is].

27. And [3said 1the 2watchman], I see the racing of the first as the racing of Ahimaaz son of Zadok. And [3said 1the 2king], [3man 2a good 1This is], and indeed for [2news 1good] he shall come.

28. And Ahimaaz yelled and said to the king, Peace. And he did obeisance to the king upon his face upon the ground. And he said, Blessed be the lord  your God, who shut up the men, the ones lifting  their hand against  my master the king.

29. And [3said 1the 2king], Is there peace to the young man  Absalom? And Ahimaaz said, I saw the [2multitude  1great] being gladdened in the sending Joab the servant of the king, and  your servant, and I do not know what happened there.

30. And [3said 1the 2king], Turn aside and stand by here! And he turned aside and stood.

31. And behold,  Cushi came. And Cushi said to the king, Let there be good news announced,  O my master the king! for [2passed judgment 3for you 1the lord] today of the hand of all the ones rousing against you.

32. And [3said 1the 2king] to  Cushi, How is the peace to the young man  Absalom? And Cushi said, Let be as that young man, the enemies  of my master the king! and all as many as rise up against you for evils.

33. And [3was disturbed 1the 2king], and he ascended into the upper room of the gate and wept. And so he said as  he wept, O My son, Absalom. O my son!, O my son, Absalom. What that I couldn't give  my death for you, I instead of you, Absalom, O my son! O my son.  

## 2 Samuel 19

1.  David Mourns Absalom's Death And it was announced  to Joab, saying, Behold, the king weeps and mourns over Absalom.

2. And [5became 1the 2deliverance 3in  4that day] for mourning to all the people. For [3heard 1the 2people]   in that day, saying that, [3frets 1The 2king] for  his son.

3. And [3stole away 1the 2people] in  that day  to enter into the city, as [2steal away  1people]  being shamed in  their fleeing in the battle.

4. And the king hid  his face, and [3cried out 1the 2king 5voice 4with a great], saying, O my son, Absalom. Absalom, O my son.

5. And Joab entered to the king into the house, and said, You disgraced today the faces of all  your servants, of the ones delivering  your life today, and the life  of your sons, and  of your daughters, and the life  of your wives, and the life  of your concubines,

6.  to love the ones detesting you, and to detest the ones loving you, that you identify today that [2are nothing 3to you 1your rulers], nor your servants. For I know that Absalom, if he were alive today, and even all we had died, that then it would have been pleasing before you.

7. And now arise! go forth and speak unto the heart  of your servants! for by the lord I swear by an oath, that unless you should go forth, in no way should [2remain 1a man] with you  this night. And realize this in yourself! that [2evil 3will be upon you 1this] over all the evil  coming upon you from your youth until  now.

8. And [3rose up 1the 2king], and he sat at the gate. And all the people announced, saying, Behold, the king sits down at the gate. And [4came 1all 2the 3people] before the king. And Israel fled, each to  his tent.

9. And [4were 1all 2the 3people] arguing among all the tribes of Israel, saying,  King David rescued us from the hand of all  our enemies, and he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines. And now he fled from the land.

10. And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, died in the war. And now, why are you silent  to return the king? And the saying by all Israel came to the king.

11. And  king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah! saying, Why have you become last  to return the king to  his house? And the word of all Israel came to the king.

12. [3brethren 2my 1You are], of my bones and of my flesh. Why have you become for the last ones  to return the king to  his house?

13. And to Amasa you shall say, Are [2not 3of my bone 4and 5of my flesh 1you]? And now, thus may [2do 3to me  1God], and thus add more, if [2not 4ruler 5of the force 1you shall 3be] before me all the days instead of Joab.

14. And he leaned the heart of every man of Judah, as [2man 1one]. And they sent to the king, saying, You return, and all  your servants!

15. And [3returned 1the 2king], and came unto the Jordan. And the men of Judah came to Gilgal  to go to meet the king,  to cause [3to pass over 1the 2king] the Jordan.

16. And [9hastened 1Shimei 2son 3of Gera 4son 5of the 6Benjaminite 7from 8Bahurim], and he went down with the men of Judah to meet  king David.

17. And there were a thousand men with him from  Benjamin, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and [2fifteen 3sons 1his], and [2twenty 3servants 1his] with him. And they went straight unto the Jordan before the king. 

18.  David Returns to Jerusalem And he passed over the ford  to arouse the household of the king, and  to do the upright thing in his eyes. And Shimei son of Gera fell upon his face before the king, at his passing over the Jordan.

19. And he said to the king, Let not indeed [2consider  1my master] my lawlessness! and remember not as much as [2did wrong  1your servant] in the day which [4went forth  1my master 2the 3king] from Jerusalem,  [3to put it 1for the 2king] upon  his heart!

20. For [2knows  1your servant] that I have sinned. And behold, I have come today first of all of the house of Joseph  to go down myself for the meeting  of my master the king.

21. And [4answered 1Abishai 2son 3of Zeruiah] and said, For this should not [2be put to death 1Shimei], for he cursed the anointed one of the lord?

22. And David said, What is it to me and to you, sons of Zeruiah, that you become to me today to plot? Shall today [5be put to death 1any 2man 3of 4Israel], no. I do not know that today I shall reign over  Israel.

23. And [3said 1the 2king] to Shimei, You shall not die. And [3swore by an oath 4to him 1the 2king].

24. And Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, son of Saul went down for a meeting with the king, and attended not to  his feet, nor prepared  his mustache, and  his garments he did not wash from the day which [3went forth 1the 2king] until the day which he came in peace.

25. And it came to pass when he entered into Jerusalem for a meeting with the king, that [3said 4to him 1the 2king], Why is it that you did not go with me, Mephibosheth?

26. And [2said 3to 4him 1Mephibosheth], O my master, O king,  my servant misled me, for [2said  1your servant] to him, Saddle for me the donkey, for I should mount upon it and go with the king, for [2is lame  1your servant].

27. And he used craft with  your servant against  my master the king. But  my master the king is as a messenger of God, and you do what is good in your eyes!

28. For there was not any to the house  of my father, but only men for death to my master the king. And you put  your servant   to eat at  your table. And what [2is there 3to me 4still 1reason], even  to cry out still to the king?

29. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], Why do you still speak  your words? I said, You and Ziba divide the field!

30. And Mephibosheth said to the king, And [2all the things 1let him take] after the coming  of my master the king in peace to  his house. 

31.  David Shows Kindness to Barzillai And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and passed over [3with 4the king 1the 2Jordan],  to send him forward from the Jordan.

32. And Barzillai was [2old man 1an exceedingly], a son of eighty years, and he nourished the king during  his living in Mahanaim, for [4man 3great 1he was 2a very].

33. And [3said 1the 2king] to  Barzillai, You shall pass over with me, and I will nourish  your old age with me in Jerusalem.

34. And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of years of my life that I should ascend with the king unto Jerusalem?

35. [4a son 5of eighty 6years 1I 2am 3today]. Can I know between good and between bad? Shall [3still taste  2servant 1your] what I shall eat or shall drink, no. Shall I hear still the voice of singing men and singing women, no. Then why [2be  1should your servant] a load upon  my master the king?

36. For [5a little 2shall pass over  1your servant 3the 4Jordan] with the king. And why  does my master the king recompense to me this recompense?

37. Return indeed  your servant! and I shall die in  my city, by the burying-place  of my father and  of my mother. And behold,  your servant Chimham  my son shall pass over with  my master the king; and you shall do for him the pleasing thing before you.

38. And [3said 1the 2king], [4with 5me 1Let 3pass over 2Chimham], and I will do to him the pleasing thing before you, and what ever you should give order to me I will do for you.

39. And [4passed over 1all 2the 3people] the Jordan, and the king was established, and [3kissed 1the 2king]  Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to  his people.

40. And [3passed over 1the 2king] into Gilgal, and Chimham passed over with him. And all the people of Judah caused him to pass over, and  half of the people of Israel.

41. And behold, every man of Israel came to the king. And they said to the king, Why is it that [5stole 6you  1our brethren 2the 3men 4of Judah], and caused [5to pass over 1the 2king 3and  4his household] the Jordan, and all the men of David with him?

42. And [3answered 1the men 2of Judah] to the men of Israel, and said, Because [3is a near relative 4to us 1the 2king]. And why is this you are enraged on account of  this matter? Or in eating have we eaten any food from the king, or a gift given to us?

43. And [4answered 1the 2men 3of Israel] to the men of Judah, and said, There are ten hands to me for the king, also indeed in  David I am over you. And why is it that you insult me, and it was not  my word first  to return the king to me? And [5was hardened 1the 2saying 3of the men 4of Judah] above the saying of the men of Israel.  

## 2 Samuel 20

1.  Judah's Loyalty to David And [3there 2was encountered 1a man], [2son 1a mischievous], and his name was Sheba son of Bichri, a man  of Benjamin. And he trumped the trumpet, and said, There is not to us a portion among David, nor an inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each man to  his tents, O Israel.

2. And ascended every man of Israel from behind David to follow after Sheba son of Bichri. But the men of Judah cleaved to  their king from the Jordan and unto Jerusalem.

3. And David entered unto  his house in Jerusalem, and [3took 1the 2king] the ten women  of his concubines, whom he left behind to guard the house; and he gave them for house guard, and he nourished them, but [3to 4them 1he did not 2enter]. And they were held until the days of their death [2as widows 1living].

4. And [3said 1the 2king] to Amasa, Call to me men of Judah in three days, but you [2here 1stand]!

5. And Amasa went  to summon  Judah, and he passed time beyond the time which [2ordered 3him 1David].

6. And David said to Abishai, Now [4shall do us evil 1Sheba 2son 3of Bichri] above Absalom. And now take with yourself the servants  of your master, and pursue after him! so that he should not find for himself [2cities 1fortified], and he should shadow  our eyes.

7. And [4went forth 5after 6him 1the 2men 3of Joab], and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty ones. And they went forth from Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.

8. And they were by the [2stone  1great]  in Gibeon. And Amasa entered in front of them. And Joab being girded [2uniform  3garment 1with his], and upon him [2being tied around 1was a sword] being teamed up on  his loin in its sheath. And the sword came forth and fell. 

9.  Joab kills Amasa And Joab said  to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And [5constrained 1the 3hand  2right 4of Joab] the beard of Amasa  to kiss him.

10. And Amasa did not guard from the sword, of the one in the hand of Joab. And [2hit 3him 4with 5it 1Joab] in his flank, and [3poured out  2belly 1his] upon the ground, and it was not repeated a second time to him, and he died. And Joab and Abishai  his brother pursued after Sheba son of Bichri.

11. And a man stood by him, one of the servants of Joab. And he said, Who is the one wanting Joab, and who is the one wanting David? Be behind  Joab.

12. And Amasa having died, and being befouled in the blood, was in the middle of the road. And [2beheld 1a man] that [4stood 1all 2the 3people]. And he returned  Amasa from the road to the field, and cast upon him a cloak, for he beheld that every one  coming stopped by him.

13. And it came to pass when he removed him from out of the road, [5went by 1all 2the 3people 4of Israel] after Joab,  to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.

14. And he went through among all the tribes  of Israel, to Abel and Beth-maacah. And they were assembled, and they came after him.

15. And they came and assaulted against him in  Abel and Beth-maacah. And they cast a seige mound against the city, and it stood in the area around the wall. And all the people  with Joab purposed to throw down the wall.

16. And [3yelled out 2woman 1a wise] from the city, and said, Hearken indeed! hearken! Say indeed to Joab, Approach unto here! and I will speak to him.

17. And he drew near to her. And [3said 1the 2woman], Are you Joab? And he said, I am. And she said to him, Hear the words  of your maidservant! And he said, [3listening 1I 2am].

18. And she said, saying, [2a word 1They spoke] at first, saying, By asking they shall ask in Abel; and thus they ceased.

19. I am peaceable of ones supporting Israel. But you seek to kill a city, even a mother-city in Israel. Why do you swallow down the inheritance of the lord?

20. And Joab answered and said, May it not be to me to swallow it, and shall I utterly destroy it? 

21.  Sheba's Head Delivered Up [3is not 4so 1The 2word]. For a man from mount Ephraim, Sheba son of Bichri is his name, lifted up  his hand against  king David. Give him to me only, and I shall go forth from the city. And [3said 1the 2woman] to Joab, Behold,  [2his head 1I will toss] to you over the wall.

22. And [3went in 1the 2woman] to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in  her wisdom. And they removed the head of Sheba son of Bichri, and they tossed it to Joab. And he trumped with the horn, and they scattered from the city, each man to  his tents. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.

23. And  Joab was over all the force of Israel. And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites.

24. And Adoram was over the tribute. And Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recording.

25. And Sheva was scribe, And Zadok and Abiathar were priests.

26. And indeed Ira the Jarite was priest  to David.  

## 2 Samuel 21

1.  David Recompenses the Gibeonites And there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year  next to year. And David sought the face of the lord. And the lord said, Against Saul and against  his house is the iniquity, in the death of his blood shed, for which he put to death the Gibeonites.

2. And [3called 1the 2king] the Gibeonites, and he spoke to them. And the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel, for [2of 3the 4remnants 5of the 6Amorites 1they were], and the sons of Israel swore an oath to them. But Saul sought to strike them in  his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah.

3. And David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And by what means shall I atone, and you shall bless the inheritance of the lord?

4. And [3said 4to him 1the 2Gibeonites], There is not a problem with us over silver nor gold with Saul, and with  his house; and there is no man for us to put to death from all Israel.

5. And he said, What you say even I will do for you. And they said to the king, The man who finished us off entirely, and pursued us, who misled to utterly destroy us, we shall remove him, so that [2is not 3established 1he] in any border of Israel.

6. Give to us seven men from  his sons, and we will hang them in the sun to the lord in  Gibeah of Saul, chosen of the lord. And [3said 1the 2king], I will give them.

7. And [3spared 1the 2king] for  Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, son of Saul, on account of the oath of the lord  between them; even between David and between Jonathan the son of Saul. 

8.  The Gibeonites Hang Saul's Sons And [3took 1the 2king] the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul --  Armoni and  Mephibosheth, and the five sons  of Michal daughter of Saul, whom she bore  to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholahite.

9. And he gave them into the hand of the Gibeonites. And they hung them in the sun in the mountain before the lord. And they fell there the seven together. And they were put to death in days of harvest at first, at the beginning [2harvest 1of the barley].

10. And [4took 1Rizpah 2daughter 3of Aiah]  sackcloth, and she strew a bed for herself upon the rock from the beginning [2harvest 1of the barley] until of which time [2dripped 3upon 4them 1waters] from God from  heaven. And she did not allow the birds of the heaven to rest upon them by day, nor the wild beasts of the field by night.

11. And it was reported  to David all as much as [6did 1Rizpah 2daughter 3of Aiah 4concubine 5of Saul].

12. And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan  his son from the men of Jabish Gilead, of the ones stealing them from the square of Beth-shan, [3hanging 4them 5there 1of the 2Philistines] in the day in which [3struck 1the 2Philistines]  Saul in Gilboa.

13. And he bore from there the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan  his son, and he gathered the bones of the ones hanging in the sun.

14. And he entombed the bones of Saul, and of Jonathan  his son, and the bones of the ones being expose to the sun, in the land of Benjamin, in the side of the hill, in the tomb of Kish  his father. And they did all as much as [3gave charge 1the 2king]. And God heeded to the land after these things. 

15.  David Wars with the Philistines And there was still war against the Philistines with Israel. And David went down and  his servants with him, and they waged war with the Philistines; and David grew faint.

16. And Ishbi of Nob, who was among the progeny  of Rapha, and the weight  of his spear was three hundred shekels scale-weight of brass, and he being girded with a truncheon, even considered  to strike  David.

17. And [4helped 5him 1Abishai 2son 3of Zeruiah], and he struck the Philistine and killed him. Then [4swore by an oath 1the 2men 3of David], saying, You shall not come forth still with us into battle, that in no way [4should be extinguished 1the 2lamp 3of Israel].

18. And it came to pass after these things war was still with the Philistines in Nob. Then [4struck 1Sibbechai 2the 3Hushathite] the ones assembling of the descendants of the giants.

19. And there was still war with the Philistines in Nob. And [6struck 1Elhanan 2son 3of Jaareoregim 4the 5Beth-lehemite]  Goliath the Gittite, and the wood  of his spear was as the beam of a loom of one weaving.

20. And there was still war in Gath. And there was a man of Madon, and the fingers  of his hands, and the toes  of his feet were six and six, twenty-four in number; and indeed he was born to Rapha.

21. And he berated  Israel, and [6struck 7him 1Jonathan 2son 3of Shimea 4brother 5of David].

22.  These four were born to descendants of the giants in Gath, to the [2of Rapha 1house]. And they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand  of his servants.  

## 2 Samuel 22

1.  David's Ode to The LORD And David spoke to the lord the words  of this ode in the day which [2rescued 3him 1the lord] from the hand of all  his enemies, and from out of the hand of Saul.

2. And he said, The lord my rock, and my fortress, and the one rescuing me.

3.  My God, my guard, I will be yielded upon him; my defender and horn of my deliverance; my shielder and my refuge; my deliverance from the unjust; you shall deliver me.

4. Praiseworthy, I shall call upon the lord, and from  my enemies I shall be delivered.

5. For [3compassed 4me 1conflicts 2of death], and the rushing streams of lawlessness made me distraught.

6. Cords of Hades encircled me, and [3anticipated 4me 1shackles 2of death].

7. In my affliction I shall call upon the lord, and to  my God I will yell. And he heard [2from out of 3his temple 1my voice], and  my cry in  his ears.

8. And [3was shaken 4and 5disturbed 1the 2earth]; even the foundations of the heaven were disturbed and thrown into a spasm, for the lord was enraged with them.

9. There ascended smoke in  his wrath, and fire from out of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it.

10. And he leaned the heavens, and came down; and dimness was under  his feet.

11. And he mounted upon cherubim, and was spread out, and was seen upon the wings of the winds.

12. And he placed darkness for his concealment. Round about him  his tent was darkness of waters; thickened in clouds of air.

13. From the brightness before him [3were kindled 1coals 2of fire].

14. [3thundered 4from out of 5heaven 1The 2 lord], and the highest gave out his voice.

15. And he sent arrows, and he dispersed them; and he flashed lightning, and he startled them.

16. And [3were seen 1the releases 2of the sea], and [5were uncovered 1the 2foundations 3of the 4inhabitable world] at the reproach of the lord, by the breath of spirit of his rage.

17. He sent from the height, and took me; he drew me out of [2waters 1many].

18. He delivered me from the strength of my enemies, from the ones detesting me; for they were strong above me.

19. They anticipated me in a day of my affliction, and the lord became my stay.

20. And he led me into an enlargement, and rescued me, for he thought to do well by me.

21. And [2recompensed 3unto me 1the lord] according to  my righteousness. And according to the cleanliness  of my hands he shall make recompense to me.

22. For I guarded the ways of the lord, and was not impious before  my God.

23. For all  his judgments were in front of me, and  his ordinances did not depart from me.

24. And I will be unblemished to him, and I shall keep guard from  my lawlessness.

25. And [2shall recompense 3to me 1the lord] according to  my righteousness, and according to the cleanliness  of my hands before  his eyes.

26. With the sacred you shall be sacred, and with the innocent you shall be innocent,

27. and with the chosen you shall be chosen; and with the crooked you shall be crooked.

28. And the [2people  1poor] you shall preserve, and the eyes of the proud you shall humble.

29. For you shall light my lamp, O lord; and the lord shall shine forth in my darkness.

30. For in you I shall run lightly armed, and by  my God I shall leap over a wall.

31.  God -- unblemished  is his way. The saying of the lord is tried in the fire. He is a defender to all the ones yielding upon him.

32. For who is God besides the lord? And who is creator besides  our God?

33.  God -- the one strengthening me, is power; and he established [2as unblemished  1my way];

34. setting  my feet as a stag, and standing me upon the heights;

35. teaching  my hands for war, and breaking the bow of brass by my arms.

36. And you gave to me a shield  of my deliverance, and obedience of you multiplied me.

37. And you widened  my footsteps underneath me, and [2did not 3shake  1my legs].

38. I will pursue  my enemies, and I will remove them. And I shall not return until of which time I shall finish them off.

39. And I will crush them, and they shall not rise up; and they shall fall under  my feet.

40. And you shall gird on me power for war. You shall bend the ones rising up against me, underneath me.

41. And  [2my enemies 1you gave] to me; [2the back of the neck 3of ones detesting 4me 1I trampled].

42. They yelled out, and there was not one delivering; to the lord, and he did not take heed of them.

43. And I ground them as dust of the earth; [2as 3the mud 4of the 5streets 1I made them fine].

44. And you rescued me from disputes of people; you shall guard me as head of nations. A people whom not knowing, served to me.

45. With a hearing ear it obeyed me. [2sons 1Alien] lied to me;

46. [2sons 1alien] shall reel -- and they shall trip from  their confinement.

47. As the lord lives -- for blessed be the one shaping me, and [2shall be raised up high  1my God] --  my deliverer.

48. The lord is strong, the one giving acts of vengeance to me, and humbling peoples underneath me.

49. And he led me from my enemies. And from the ones rousing up against me, you shall raise me up high. [3from 4men 5of offences 1You shall rescue 2me].

50. On account of this I will make acknowledgement to you, O lord, among the nations. And [2to 3your name 1I will strum],

51. O one magnifying the deliverance  of his king, and doing mercy to his anointed one, to David and to his seed unto the eon.  

## 2 Samuel 23

1.  The Last Words of David And these are the [2words 3of David  1last]. Trustworthy David, son of Jesse, and a trustworthy man whom God raised up -- anointed one of the God of Jacob, and for beauty is the psalm  of Israel.

2. Spirit of the lord spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.

3. [4spoke 1The 2God 3of Israel] to me; [3spoke 1the guardian 2of Israel], [2ruling 3among 4men 1justice], the prince in fear of God.

4. And as [3light 1the 2early morning], [2arises 1the sun] in the morning, and it shall not darken; from brightness and from out of rain as pasturage of the earth.

5. For is not thus  my house with God? for [3covenant 2an eternal 1he established] with me, to deliver me, prepared at all time being guarded. For all my deliverance, and all my will is in the lord, for in no way shall [3grow 1the 2lawbreaker];

6. as a thorn-bush being pushing out are all these; for no hand shall take them.

7. And a man who shall labor among them, full of iron and wooden spear, and in fire burning, they shall be burnt in their shame. 

8.  David's Mighty Men These are the names of the mighty ones of David. Joshabbasshebeth the Tachmonite -- [2first 3of the 4three 1this one is]. Adino the Eznite -- this one unsheathed  his broadsword against eight hundred slain at once.

9. And with him is Eleazar son of Dodo, son of his uncle among the three  mighty ones, this one was with David in  his berating among the Philistines. And the Philistines gathered together there for war. And [3ascended 1the men 2of Israel] before their face,

10. and he rose up and struck the Philistines, until of which [2tired  1his hand], and [2was cleaved  1his hand] upon the sword. And the lord made [2deliverance 1a great] in  that day. And the people returned after  for  despoiling.

11. And after him Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. And [3gathered together 1the 2Philistines] in Theria, and there was there a portion of a field full of lentils. And the people fled from the face of the Philistines.

12. And he stood in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and struck the Philistines. And the lord executed [2deliverance 1a great].

13. And [6went down 1three 2from 3the 4thirty 5rulers], and they entered unto David into the cave of Adullam. And the battle order of the Philistines camped in the valley of Rephaim.

14. And David was then in the citadel, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.

15. And David desired, and said, Who will give [3to drink 1me 2water] from the well, the one in Beth-lehem, of the one at the gate?

16. And [4tore up 1the 2three 3mighty ones] the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water from the well, of the one in Beth-lehem, of the one by the gate. And they took of it, and came to David. And he did not want to drink it, and he offered it a libation to the lord.

17. And he said, Kindness be to me, O lord,  to do this. Shall [2the blood 3of the 4men  5going 6with  7their lives 1I drink], no. And he did not want to drink it. These things [4did 1the 2three 3mighty ones].

18. And Abishai the brother of Joab, son of Zeruiah, was foremost of the three. And he awakened  his spear upon three hundred slain, and to him was a name among the three.

19. Of the three he was honored, and was to them for ruler, and unto the first three he did not arrive at.

20. And Benaiah son of Jehoiada, son [2man 1of a mighty], with great works from Kabzeel. This one struck the two sons of Ariel  of Moab. And he went down and struck the lion in the midst of the pit in [2day 1a snowy].

21. And he struck the Egyptian man, [2man 1a remarkable]; and in the hand of the Egyptian was a spear. And he went down to him with a rod, and seized by force the wooden spear from out of the hand of the Egyptian, and killed him with  his spear.

22. These things [4did 1Benaiah 2son 3of Jehoiada], and to him was a name among the three mighty ones.

23. He was over the thirty honorable ones, but to the first three he did not arrive at. And [2ordered 3him 1David] for  his reports. And these are the names of the mighty ones of David the king.

24. Asahel brother of Joab among the thirty. Elhanan son of Dodo his uncle in Beth-lehem.

## 2 Samuel 24

1.  David Numbers the People And [2proceeded 3in anger 1the lord] to burn in Israel. And he stirred up  David against them, saying, Go count  Israel and  Judah!

2. And [3said 1the 2king] to Joab, ruler of the forces of the ones with him, Go around indeed all the tribes  of Israel and Judah, from Dan and unto Beer-sheba, and number the people! and I shall know the number of the people.

3. And Joab said to the king, And may [3add 1the lord  2your God] to  your people, as even these a hundred foldly, and the eyes  of my master the king seeing it -- but  my master the king, why do you want to do  this matter?

4. And [5excelled 1the 2word 3of the 4king] against Joab, and  the rulers of the force. And Joab went forth, and the rulers of the force before the king to number the people  of Israel.

5. And they passed over the Jordan, and they camped in Aroer at the right of the city of the one in the midst of the ravine of Gad and Eleizer.

6. And they came into Gilead, and into the land Tahtim Hodshi; and they came into Dan, and encircled to Sidon,

7. and they came into Mapsar of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivite, and the Canaanite. And they went out unto the south of Judah into Beer-sheba.

8. And they traveled about in all the land, and came at the end of nine months and twenty days into Jerusalem.

9. And Joab gave the number of the numbering of the people to the king. And there was to Israel eight hundred thousand men of the force unsheathing the broadsword. And men of Judah -- five hundred thousand men warriors.

10. And [3struck 1the heart 2of David] him after  counting the people. And David said to the lord, I have sinned exceedingly -- I having done  this thing. And now, O lord, remove indeed the iniquity  of your servant, for I was in folly exceedingly.

11. And David rose up in the morning, and the word of the lord came to Gad the prophet, the one seeing for David, saying,

12. Go and speak to David! saying, Thus says the lord, Three things I lift unto you; you choose for yourself one of them! and I will execute against you. 

13.  Judgment against David And Gad went to David, and he announced, and he said to him, Choose for yourself what is to be to you! Three years of famine in  your land, or three months for you to flee before  your enemies, and they will be pursuing you, or [4to be 1three 2days 3of plague] in  your land. Now then, know and perceive! what I shall answer to the one sending me.

14. And David said to Gad, [3narrow choice 4to me 2an exceedingly 1It is] -- the three things. I shall fall into the hands of the lord, for [3great 1his compassions 2are exceedingly], but into the hands of men in no way shall I fall.

15. And [2chose 3for himself 1David]  plague. And the lord appointed plague in Israel from morning and unto the hour of dinner. And there died from out of the people from Dan and unto Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.

16. And [3stretched out 1the 2angel]  his hand to Jerusalem,  to utterly destroy it. And the lord relented over the evil, and said to the angel  destroying among the people, Enough now, spare  your hand! And the angel of the lord was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

17. And David spoke to the lord in  his beholding the angel  striking among the people, and he said, Behold, I sinned, and I the shepherd did evil, and these are the sheep, what did they do? Let [3come 2indeed  1your hand] against me, and against the house  of my father!

18. And Gad came to David in  that day, and said to him, Ascend, and set up  an altar to the lord in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite!

19. And David ascended according to the word of Gad the prophet, in which manner [2gave charge 3to him 1the lord].

20. And Araunah looked, and he beheld the king, and  his servants coming near unto him. And Araunah went forth, and did obeisance to the king upon his face upon the ground.

21. And Araunah said, For what reason comes  my master the king to  his servant? And David said, To acquire from you the threshing-floor,  to build an altar to the lord, so that [5should be constrained  1the devastation 2upon 3the 4people].

22. And Araunah said to David, Take it and offer,  O my master the king, to the lord what is good in your eyes! Behold, the oxen are for a whole burnt-offering, and the wheels, and the items of the oxen are for wood.

23. The whole amount Araunah gave to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The lord  your God, may he bless you.

24. And [3said 1the 2king] to Araunah, Not so, but only by acquiring shall I acquire it from you for a price, for I shall not offer to the lord my God a whole burnt-offering without paying a charge. And David acquired the threshing-floor, and the oxen with [2silver 3shekels 1fifty].

25. And [2built 3there 1David] an altar to the lord, and he offered whole burnt-offerings, and peace offerings. And the lord heeded the land, and held up the devastation on top of Israel.
