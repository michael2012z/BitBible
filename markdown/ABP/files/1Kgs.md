11. And Nathan said to Bath-sheba, mother of Solomon, saying, Did you not hear that [4reigns 1Adonijah 2son 3of Haggith], and  our master David does not know.

12. And now, come, I will advise you with advice, so that you should preserve  your life, and the life of Solomon  your son.

13. Come, enter unto  king David. And you shall say to him, Have you not, O my master, O king, sworn by an oath to your maidservant, saying that, Solomon  your son, he shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon  my throne. Then why is it that Adonijah reigns?

14. And behold, while you are speaking there with the king, that I shall enter after you, and I will fulfill  your words.

24. And Nathan said, O my master, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

25. For he went down today and sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in multitude, and called all the sons of the king, and the rulers of the force, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they said, Let [3live  1king 2Adonijah]!

26. And me  your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and Solomon  your servant he did not call.

27. If [3through  4my master 5the 6king 2has taken place  1this thing], then you did not make known to your servant who shall sit upon the throne  of my master the king after him.

28. And [3answered  1king 2David], and said, Call to me  Bath-sheba! And she entered before the king, and stood before him.

30. that as I swore by an oath to you according to the lord  God of Israel, saying that, Solomon  your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon  my throne instead of me; that thus I will do  this day.

31. And Bath-sheba bowed upon her face upon the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let [4live  1my master  2king 3David] into the eon!

32. And [3said  1king 2David], Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada! And they entered before the king.

33. And [3said 1the 2king] to them, Take with you the servants  of your master, and set Solomon  my son upon  [2mule  1my], and lead him unto  Gihon!

34. And let [8anoint 9him 10there 1Zadok 2the 3priest 4and 5Nathan 6the 7prophet] for king over Israel! And trump the horn! And you shall say, Let [3live  1king 2Solomon]!

35. And you shall ascend after him. And he shall enter, and he shall sit upon  my throne, and he shall reign instead of me. And to him I gave charge  to be for leader over Israel and over Judah.

36. And [4responded 1Benaiah 2son 3of Jehoiada] to the king, and said, May it be so. May [6confirm it 1the lord  2God  3of my master 4the 5king].

37. As the lord was with  my master the king, so may it be with Solomon, and to magnify  his throne above the throne  of my master  king David. 

38.  Solomon is Anointed King And [4went down 1Zadok 2the 3priest], and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite. And they sat  Solomon upon the mule  of king David, and they took him to  Gihon.

39. And [4took 1Zadok 2the 3priest] the horn of the oil from out of the tent, and anointed  Solomon, and trumped the horn. And [4said 1all 2the 3people], Let [3live  1king 2Solomon]!

40. And [4ascended 1all 2the 3people] after him, and all the people joined in a dance by companies of dancers, and making glad [2gladness 1in great]. And [3tore 1the 2earth] with the sound of them.

41. And Adonijah heard, and all the invited ones with him; and they completed eating. And Joab heard the sound of the horn, and said, What is the sound of the city sounding?

42. While he was speaking, that behold, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest came in. And Adonijah said, Enter, for [2a man 3of power 1you are], and for good you announce good news!

43. And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, And by all means  our master  king David established Solomon to reign.

44. And [3sent 4with 5him 1the 2king]  Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite. And they sat him upon the mule of the king.

45. And [4anointed 5him 1Zadok 2the 3priest], and Nathan the prophet as king at  Gihon. And they ascended from there making glad. And [3sounded 1the 2city] this  sound which you heard.

46. And Solomon is seated upon the throne of the kingdom.

47. And also [5came 1the 2servants 3of the 4king] to bless  our master  king David, saying, [2make good  1God] the name  of your son Solomon above  your name, and magnify  his throne above  your throne! And [3did obeisance 1the 2king] upon  his bed.

48. And indeed thus [3said 1the 2king], Blessed is the lord  God of Israel, who gave today from out of  my seed one sitting upon  my throne, and  my eyes see it.

49. And [5were startled 6and 7rose up 1all 2the ones 3called by  4Adonijah], and [2departed 1each] unto  his way.

50. And Adonijah feared from the face of Solomon, and he rose up and went forth, and took hold of of the horns of the altar.

51. And it was announced  to Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears  king Solomon, and he takes hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let [3swear by an oath 4to me 5today  1king 2Solomon] to not put to death  his servant by the broadsword.

52. And Solomon said, If he should be a son of power, in no way should there fall from  his head a hair upon the ground. But if evil should be found in him, he shall be put to death.

53. And [3sent  1king 2Solomon], and brought him from on top of the altar. And he entered and did obeisance to  king Solomon. And [2said 3to him 1Solomon], Go unto  your house!  

## 1 Kings 2

1.  David Gives Charge to Solomon And there approached the days for David  himself to die; and he gave charge to his son to Solomon, saying,

2. I am going in the way of all the earth, and you shall be strong, and you shall be a man.

3. And you shall guard the watch of the lord  your God,  to go in  his ways, to guard  his commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, and  his testimonies, as written in the law of Moses; that you should perceive all what you shall do, and everywhere of which ever you should have paid attention there.

4. So that the lord should establish  his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If [2should guard  1your sons]  their way,  to go before me in truth, with [2whole 3heart 1their], and with [2whole 3soul 1their], saying, There shall not be lifted away to you a man from the throne of Israel.

5. And now you know what [4did 5to me 1Joab 2son 3of Zeruiah], and what he did to the two rulers of the forces of Israel --  Abner son of Ner, and  Amasa son of Jether; and he killed them, and ordered up the blood of war for peace, and put [2blood 1innocent] on  his belt, the one on  his loin, and on  his sandal, the one on  his foot.

6. And you shall do according to  your wisdom, and you shall not lead down  his gray hair in peace into Hades.

7. And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite you shall have mercy, and they shall be at the eating  of your table, for so they drew near to me in  my fleeing from the face  of your brother of Absalom.

8. And behold, there is with you Shimei son of Gera, son of the Benjamite from Bahurim. And he cursed me [2curse 1a grievous] in the day in which I went into Camps. And he went down for meeting me at the Jordan, and I swore by an oath to him by the lord, saying, I shall not put [2to death 1you] by the broadsword.

9. And you shall in no way acquit him, for [3man 2a wise 1you are], and you shall know what to do with him, and you shall lead down  his gray hair with blood into Hades. 

10.  The Death of David And David slept with  his fathers, and he was entombed in the city of David.

11. And the days which David reigned over Israel were forty years. In Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years.

12. And Solomon sat upon the throne of David  his father. And [3was prepared  2kingdom 1his] exceedingly.

13. And [4entered 1Adonijah 2son 3of Haggith] to Bath-sheba, the mother of Solomon, and did obeisance to her. And she said, [3in peace  2entering 1Are you]? And he said, Peace.

14. And he said, My word to you. And she said to him, Speak!

15. And he said to her, You know that to me was the kingdom, and upon me [3set 1all 2Israel]  their face for king. And [3was turned 1the 2kingdom], and came to my brother; for by the lord it was to him.

16. And now [4request 3one 1I 2ask] from you, you should not turn away  your face. And [2said 3to him 1Bath-sheba], Speak!

17. And he said to her, Speak indeed to Solomon the king! for he will not turn away  your face, so that he shall give to me  Abishag the Shunammite for wife.

18. And Bath-sheba said, Well, I will speak for you to the king.

19. And Bath-sheba entered to  king Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah. And [3rose up 1the 2king] to meet her, and he did obeisance to her, and he sat upon  his throne. And [2was set 1a throne] for the mother of the king; and she sat on his right.

20. And she said to him, [5request 3one 4small 1I 2ask] from you, you should not turn away  my face. And [3said 4to her 1the 2king], Ask [2mother 1my], for I will not turn from you.

21. And she said, Let there be given indeed Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah  your brother for wife!

22. And [3answered  1king 2Solomon] and said to his mother, And why are you asking  Abishag for Adonijah? Then ask for him the kingdom, for this one  [3brother 1is my  2older] over me, and with him are Abiathar the priest, and with him Joab son of Zeruiah commander-in-chief -- his companion.

23. And [3swore by an oath  1king 2Solomon] according to the lord, saying, Thus may [2do 3to me  1God], and thus may he add to it for [3against  4his own life 1Adonijah spoke  2this word]. 

24.  Solomon Puts Adonijah to Death And now as the lord lives, who prepared me, and put me upon the throne of David  my father, and he made to me a house as the lord said, that today Adonijah shall be put to death.

25. And [3sent out  1king 2Solomon] by the hand of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; and he did away with him, and he died.

26. And  to Abiathar the priest [3said 1the 2king], Run unto Anathoth, to  your field! for [2a man 3marked for death 1your are], and from  this day I will not put [2to death 1you], for you lifted the ark of the covenant of the lord before David  my father, and because you were mistreated in all ways which [2was mistreated  1my father].

27. And Solomon cast out  Abiathar so that he would not be for priest to the lord; to fulfill the saying of the lord, which he said concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

28. And the report came unto Joab son of Zeruiah; for Joab was leaning after Adonijah, but [3after 4Solomon 1he did not 2turn aside]. And Joab fled to the tent of the lord, and held the horns of the altar. 

29.  Solomon Puts Joab to Death And it was reported  to Solomon, saying that, Joab has fled into the tent of the lord, and behold, he holds the horns of the altar. And Solomon sent  Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, and do away with him!

30. And Benaiah came to Joab in the tent of the lord, and he said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth! And Joab said, I do not go forth, for here I shall die. And Benaiah returned and said to the king, saying, Thus Joab has spoken, and thus he answered me.

31. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], Go, and do to him as he has said, and do away with him! And you shall bury him, and lift away today the blood which Joab poured out freely from me, and from the house  of my father.

32. And the lord returned the blood  of his iniquity onto his head, inasmuch as he met the two [4men  1just 2and 3good] above him, and killed them by the broadsword. And  my father David did not know about  Abner son of Ner, commander-in-chief of Israel, and  Amasa son of Jether, commander-in-chief of Judah.

33. And let [3return  2blood 1their] upon  his head, and upon the head  of his seed unto the eon! And to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, may there be peace by the lord into the eon.

34. And [4ascended 1Benaiah 2son 3of Jehoiada], and met him, and killed him. And they entombed him in  his house in the wilderness.

35. And [3appointed 1the 2king]  Benaiah son of Jehoiada instead of him over the military. And  [4Zadok 5the 6priest 3appointed 1the 2king], as [2priest 1foremost] instead of Abiathar. 

36.  Solomon Puts Shimei to Death And sending, [3called 1the 2king]  Shimei, and said to him, Build for yourself a house in Jerusalem, and settle there, and do not go forth from there -- not at all!

37. And it will be in the day that you exit, and pass over the rushing stream  Kidron, in knowing, know that to death you shall die,  your blood will be upon  your head.

38. And Shimei said to the king, [3is good 1The 2thing] which you have spoken, O my master, O king, thus shall [2do  1your servant]. And Shimei settled in Jerusalem three years.

39. And it came to pass after three years, that [4ran away 1two 2servants 3of Shimei] to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they reported  to Shimei, saying, Behold,  your servants are in Gath.

40. And Shimei rose up, and saddled  his donkey, and went unto Gath to Achish  to seek after  his servants. And Shimei went and led  his servants from Gath.

41. And it was reported to Solomon, saying that, Shimei went from out of Jerusalem unto Gath, and he returned.

42. And [3sent 1the 2king] and called  Shimei, and he said to him, Have I not bound you by an oath according to the lord, and I attested to you, saying, In which ever day you should go forth from out of Jerusalem, and you should go to the right or left, in knowing, know that to death you shall die? And you said to me, [5was good 1The 2word 3which 4you heard].

43. And why have you not guarded the oath of the lord, and the commandment which I gave charge to you?

44. And [3said 1the 2king] to Shimei, You know all  your evil which [2knows  1your heart], which you did to David  my father, and the lord recompensed  your evil on your head.

45. And  king Solomon is being blessed, and the throne of David will be prepared before the lord into the eon.

46. And [3gave charge  1king 2Solomon] to Benaiah son of Jehoiada. And he came forth, and did away with him, and he died.  

## 1 Kings 3

1.  Solomon Seeks Understanding in Judgment And the kingdom solidified in the hand  of Solomon. And Solomon contracted a marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he took the daughter of Pharaoh, and he brought her into the city of David, until  he completed building  his house, and the house of the lord at first, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

2. Except the people were burning incense upon the high places, for [2was not 3built 1a house] to the name of the lord until  now.

3. And Solomon loved the lord,  to go in the orders of David  his father; only [4in 5the 6high places 1he sacrificed 2and 3burned incense].

4. And he rose up and went into Gibeon to sacrifice there, for it was highest and great. [2a thousand 3whole burnt-offerings 1Solomon offered] upon the altar in Gibeon.

5. And the lord appeared to Solomon in sleep at night. And the lord said to Solomon, Ask any request for yourself!

6. And Solomon said, You did [3with  4your servant 5David  6my father 2mercy 1great], as he went before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in straightness of heart with you. And you guarded him  [3mercy  2great 1by this], to grant to him a son sitting upon  his throne as  this day.

7. And now, O lord,  my God, you gave reign to  your servant in place of David  my father. And I am [2boy 1a small]; and I do not know  my entering and  my exiting.

8. And  your servant is in the midst  of your people whom you chose, [2people 1a populous] who cannot be counted.

9. And you shall give to your servant a heart  to hear and to litigate  your people in righteousness,  to perceive between good and bad. For who shall be able to judge  [2for your people  1this weighty thing]?

10. And [3was pleasing 1the 2word] before the lord, that Solomon asked  this thing.

11. And the lord said to him, Because you asked  this thing from me, and you did not ask [3for yourself 2days 1many], and you did not ask for riches, nor asked for the lives  of your enemies; but you asked for yourself understanding  to hear judgment;

12. behold, I have done according to  your word; behold, I give to you [4heart 1an intelligent 2and 3wise]. [2as 3you 1There has not been one] before you, and after you there shall not rise up one likened to you.

13. And indeed what you have not asked, I have given to you, even riches and glory, as there is not a man likened to you among the kings.

14. And if you should have gone in  my way,  to guard  my commandments, and  my orders, as [3went 1David  2your father], then I will prolong  your days.

15. And Solomon woke up and knew the dream. And he rose up and came unto Jerusalem, and he stood in front of the altar, of the one in front of the ark of the covenant of the lord, and he led up whole burnt-offerings, and made peace offerings, and made a banquet to all  his servants. 

16.  The Justice of Solomon Then there appeared two women harlots unto the king, and they stood before him.

17. And [4said 1the 3woman 2one], Hear me, O my master. I and  this woman live in [2house 1one], and we gave birth in the house.

18. And it came to pass in the [2day  1third] of my giving birth, [3gave birth 2also  1this woman]. And we were in the same place, and there was no one with us, only both of us in the house.

19. And [4died 1the 2son  3of this woman] in the night, as she rested upon it.

20. And she rose up in the middle of the night, and she took  my son from  my embrace, and  your maidservant rested, and she rested it in  her bosom, and the son having died she rested in  my bosom.

21. And I rose up in the morning to nurse  my son, and that one was the one having died. And behold, I contemplated him in the morning; and behold, he was not  my son whom I gave birth.

22. And [4said  3woman 1the 2other], Not so, for  my son is the one living, and your son is the one having died. And she said, Not so,  your son is the one having died, and my son is the one living. And they spoke before the king.

23. And [3said 1the 2king] to them, You here say, This  my son is the one living, and  this one's son is the one having died. And you there say, Not so, but  my son is the one living, and  this one's son is the one having died.

24. And [3said 1the 2king], Take for me a sword! And they brought the sword before the king.

25. And [3said 1the 2king], Divide  [3child 1the 2living] into two, and give the one half of him to this one, and the other half of him to this other one!

26. And [3answered 1the 2woman] of whom was the mother of the [2son  1living], and she said to the king, for [3was disturbed  2womb 1her] over  her son, and she said, Hear me, O master. give to her the child, and to death let [2not 3be put to death 1it]! And she the other said, Neither to me nor to her let it be, divide it!

27. And [3responded 1the 2king] and said, Give the [2child  1living] to the one having said, Give it to her! and unto death you should not put it to death -- she is  his mother.

28. And [3heard 1all 2Israel]  this ordinance which [3passed judgment 1the 2king], and they feared from the presence of the king, for they knew that intellect of God was in him  to do justice.

33. And he spoke concerning the timbers from the cedars  in  Lebanon, and unto the hyssop  coming forth from the wall. And he spoke concerning the cattle, and concerning the winged creatures, and concerning the reptiles, and concerning the fishes.

34. And [4came to him 1all 2the 3peoples] to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And he took gifts from all the kings of the earth, as many as heard  his wisdom.  

## 1 Kings 5

1.  Hiram Helps Build God's House And [4sent 1Hiram 2king 3of Tyre]  his servants to Solomon; for he heard that they anointed him for king in place of David  his father. For [3loving 2was 1Hiram]  David all the days.

2. And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

3. You knew  my father David, that he was not able to build a house to the name of the lord  my God, because of facing the wars that were encircling him, until the lord put them under the soles  of his feet.

4. And now [3gave rest 1the lord  2my God] to me round about; there is not a plotter and there is not [2sin 1a wicked].

5. And behold, I speak concerning building a house to the name of the lord my God, as the lord spoke to David  my father, saying,  Your son whom I shall put instead of you upon  your throne, this one shall build the house to my name.

6. And now give charge, and let men fell timbers for me from  Lebanon! And behold,  my servants shall be with  your servants; and the wage  of your servants I will give to you according to all as much as you should say. For you know that there is not among us one knowing to fell timbers as the Sidonians.

7. And it came to pass as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced exceedingly. And he said, Blessed be the lord today who gives  to David [2son 1an intelligent] over  [3people  2populous 1this].

8. And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard concerning all which you have sent to me. I will do all your will for timbers of cedars and of pines.

9.  My servants shall lead them from out of  Lebanon into the sea; and I will put them on barges unto the place of which ever you should send for me. And I shall shake them off there, and you shall lift them. And you shall produce  for my want,  to give bread loaves to my house.

10. And Hiram was giving  to Solomon cedars and pines according to all  his want.

11. And Solomon gave  to Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat, and food to his house, and twenty baths of olive oil being pounded. According to this Solomon gave  to Hiram yearly.

13. And [3brought  1king 2Solomon] tribute from all Israel. And [3was 1the 2tribute] thirty thousand men.

14. And he sent them to  Lebanon -- ten thousand [2every  3month 1being changed]. [5month 4one 1They were 2in  3Lebanon], and two months at their house. And Adoniram was over the tribute.

15. And were  unto Solomon seventy thousand lifting a load, and eighty thousand quarriers in the mountain;

16. separate from the rulers  being placed over the works  of Solomon -- three thousand and three hundred supervisors over the people of the ones doing the works.

13. and I will encamp in the midst of the sons of Israel, and  I will not abandon  my people Israel.

19. And the dabir was in the middle of the house within, to give place there for the ark of the covenant of the lord.

20. Twenty cubits was the length, and twenty cubits the width, and twenty cubits the height of it. And he compassed it with gold being closed up.

21. And he made an altar according to the front of the dabir, and he compassed it with gold.

And he was brought to  king Solomon, and he did every work.

15. And he cast in a furnace the two columns for the columned porch of the house -- eighteen cubits was the height of the column, and the perimeter had a two and ten cubits cord encircling it. And so was the [2column  1second].

16. And [2two 3capitals 1he made] to put upon the heads of the [2columns 1molten] of brass -- five cubits was the height of the [2capital  1one], and five cubits was the height of the [2capital  1second].

19. And capitals upon the heads of the columns, a work of lily for the columned porch -- four cubits; and a ridge upon both of the columns, and on top of the sides of the capital.

20. And the pomegranates were two hundred in rows upon the [2capital  1second].

21. And he set up the columns of the columned porch of the temple. And he set up the [2column  1right], and he called the name of it -- Jachin. And he set up the [2column  1left], and called the name of it -- Boaz.

22. And upon the tops of the columns was a work of lily. And [5was finished 1the 2work 3of the 4columns].

23. And he made the [2sea 1cast] -- ten by a cubit from  its rim unto  its rim, globular, round about the same, five by a cubit  was its height. And a measuring meeting together thirty cubits encircled it.

24. And supports from beneath  its rim round about encircled it. Ten by a cubit raising up the sea round about. Two rows of supports cast in the foundry furnace of them.

26. And all the posteriors were to the inside, and the thickness of it was a palm, and the rim of it was as [2work 1a rim] of a cup with [2bud 1a lily]. [2of two 3thousand 4coos 1It had a capacity].

27. And he made ten bases of brass -- four cubits was the length of the [2base  1one], and four cubits the width of it, and three cubits was the height of it.

28. And this is the work of the base joining it, and joining between the protruding parts.

29. And upon the joineries  between the protruding parts were lions and oxen and cherubim. And upon the protruding parts so also from above and from below the lions and the oxen places [2work 1of a descending].

30. And four wheels of brass were to the [2base  1one] and the fastenings of brass and [2four 3parts 1its], of their protrusion supports from beneath the bathing tubs, and protrusion supports pouring from the other side a man being situated before. And the mouth of it within the top and upward one cubit.

32. And four  wheels were underneath the small pillars. And hands were in the wheels in the base. And the height of the [2wheel  1one] was a cubit and a half.

33. And the work of the wheels was as the work [2wheels 1of chariot]. And  their hands and  their backs and  their matters  were all casted.

34. And four protrusion supports were upon the four corners of the [2base  1one]. From out of the base  were its shoulders.

35. And upon the head of the base a half  a cubit [3size 1was its 2globular] round about upon the head of the base. And the hands of it and  its joineries were of it; and it opened upon the beginnings  of its hands.

36. And  its joinery was cherubim, and lions, and [2palms 1standing], each being next to the other in front of it inside, round about.

37. According to this he made  ten bases, [2order 1with one] and [2measure 1one] to all.

38. And he made ten pots of brass, [2of forty 3coos 1having the capacity] to the one pot, measuring four cubits. And [2pot  1one] was upon the [2base  1one] for the ten bases.

39. And he put the ten bases, five on the protrusion support of the house at the right sides, and five on the protrusion support of the house at the left sides; and the sea on the protrusion support of the house at the right sides, according to the east from the side of the south.

40. And Hiram made the kettles, and the tongs, and the bowls. And Hiram completed making all the works which he made for king Solomon in the house of the lord --

41. [2columns 1two] and the twisted works of the carvings, the ones being upon the heads of the [2columns 1two]; and [2latticed works 1two],  to cover both the twisted works of the carvings, the ones being upon the columns;

42. and the pomegranates -- four hundred to both the latticed works; two rows of pomegranates to the [2latticed work  1one],  to cover all over both the twisted works, the ones being upon both of the columns;

43. and the ten bases, and the [2pots  1ten] upon the bases;

44. and the [2sea 1one], and the twelve oxen  underneath the sea;

45. and the kettles, and the tongs, and the bowls. And all the items which Hiram made for king Solomon for the house of the lord [2of brass 1were entirely].

46. In the adjacent area of the Jordan [3cast them 1the 2king] in the thick  earth between Succoth and between Zarthan.

47. And [4put away 1Solomon 2the 3king] all the items, because of [2multitude 1the exceeding] which there was no weight of the brass.

48. And Solomon made all the items in the house of the lord -- the [2altar  1gold], and the table (upon which are the bread loaves of the [2place setting 1gold]).

49. And the [2lamp-stands 1five] at the right sides, and five at the left sides, in front of the dabir [2of gold 1being completely made]; and the oil lamp bowls, and the lamps, and the oil funnels were of gold;

## 1 Kings 8

1.  Solomon Holds an Assembly Then [3held an assembly  1king 2Solomon] of all the elders of Israel, and all rulers of tribes, leaders of the families of the sons of Israel, for  king Solomon in Jerusalem  to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord from out of the city of David -- this is Zion,

2. in the month Athanim during its holiday, this is [2month 1the seventh]. And [5came 1all 2the 3elders 4of Israel].

3. And [3lifted 1the 2priests] the ark,

4. and the tent of the testimony, and all the [2items  1holy], the ones for the tent of the testimony.

5. And the king and all the people of Israel were before the ark sacrificing oxen and sheep -- innumerable.

6. And [3carried 1the 2priests] the ark of the covenant of the lord unto  its place, into the dabir of the house, into the holy  of holies, under the wings of the cherubim.

7. For the cherubim were being opened and spread out in the wings over the place of the ark. And [3covered all 1the 2cherubim] over the ark, and over  its holy things from above.

8. And [3projected 1the 2sanctified staves], and [5looked out 1the 2heads 3of the 4sanctified staves] from the holies unto the front of the dabir. And they were not seen outside, and they were there until  this day.

9. There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone, tablets of the covenant, which [2put 3there 1Moses] in Horeb, which the lord ordained with the sons of Israel in  their going forth from out of the land of Egypt. 

10.  God's Glory Fills the House And it happened as [3came forth 1the 2priests] from out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house.

11. And [3were not 4able 1the 2priests] to stand to officiate in front of the cloud, for [3filled 1the glory 2of the lord] the house of the lord.

12. Then Solomon said, The lord spoke of encamping in dimness.

13. And I built a house to your name, holy to you, and readied, and to your chair  [2to encamp 1for you] in it into the eons.

14. And [3turned 1the 2king]  his face, and blessed all Israel. And all the assembly of Israel stood.

15. And he said, Blessed be the lord  God of Israel, who spoke by his mouth concerning David  my father, and by  his hands fulfilled, saying,

16. From which day I led out  my people Israel from Egypt, I have not chosen  a city in one chiefdom of Israel  to build a house  [3to be  2name 1for my] there. But I chose in David  to be the one leading over  my people Israel.

17. And it was upon the heart of David  my father to build a house to the name of the lord God of Israel.

18. And the lord said to David  my father, That it was upon  your heart to construct a house to my name [2well 1you did], for it was upon  your heart.

19. Except you shall not build the house, but  your son, the one coming forth from out of  your sides, this one shall build the house to my name.

20. And the lord raised up  his word which he spoke. And I am risen up instead of David  my father, and I sat down upon the throne of Israel, as the lord spoke. And I built the house to the name of the lord  God of Israel.

21. And I established there a place for the ark, in which is there the covenant of the lord, which the lord ordained with  our fathers, in  his leading them from out of the land of Egypt. 

22.  Solomon's Prayer And Solomon stood in front of the altar of the lord before all the assembly of Israel. And he opened and spread out  his hands into the heaven.

23. And he said, O lord  God of Israel, there is no [2as 3you 1God] in the heaven upward and upon the earth below, guarding covenant and mercy with your servant, to the one going before you with [2entire 3heart 1his];

24. which you kept with your servant David,  my father, which you have spoken by  your mouth; and by  your hands you fulfilled as even this day.

25. And now, O lord  God of Israel, keep with your servant David,  my father, that which you spoke to him! saying, There shall not be lifted away from you a man from my face sitting upon the throne of Israel, except that [2shall guard  1your sons]  their ways  to go before me, as you went before me.

26. And now, O lord  God of Israel, trustworthy indeed  is your word to David  my father.

27. But shall truly God dwell with men upon the earth? Shall the heaven and the heavens of the heavens  be sufficient for you? How then also  this house which I built to your name?

28. And should you look also upon  my prayer, upon  my supplication, O lord  God of Israel, to hear the supplication and the prayer which  your servant prays before you, to you today.

29. For [2to be 1your eyes] open towards  this house day and night, to  this place which you said, [2shall be  1My name] there.  To listen to the prayer which [2prays  1your servant] in  this place.

30. Then you shall hearken to the supplication  of your servant, and  of your people Israel, as many things as they should pray in  this place. And you should hear in  [2place  1your dwelling] in heaven, and you shall do; and you shall be propitious,

31. as many things as [2should sin 1a man] against his neighbor. And if he should take upon himself an oath  to curse him, and he should come and should declare openly in front of  your altar in  this house;

32. then you shall listen from the heaven, and shall act, and shall judge  your people Israel --  to act as lawless with the lawless, to impute  his way upon his head; and  to do justice with the just, to impute to him according to  his righteousness.

33. And in the failing  of your people Israel before their enemies -- because they shall sin against you, and shall return and shall acknowledge  your name, and shall pray and beseech in  this house;

34. then you shall hearken from the heaven, and shall be propitious to the sins  of your people Israel, and shall turn towards them in the land which you gave to their fathers.

35. And in the holding together the heaven and there not being rain because they shall sin against you, and if they shall pray in  this place, and shall acknowledge  your name, and [2from  3their sins 1shall turn], whenever you should humble them;

36. then you shall listen from the heaven, and shall be propitious to the sins  of your servant, and  your people Israel, for you shall manifest to them the [2way  1good] to go by it; and you shall give rain upon  your land, which you gave to your people for an inheritance.

37. And if famine happens, if plague happens, when there will be a combustion, or the grasshopper, if blight happens, and if [2shall afflict 3him  1his enemy] in one  of their cities, every event, every misery,

38. every prayer, every supplication, if it should happen to any man,  whenever [2should know 1each one] the infection of his heart, and should open and spread out  his hands in  this house,

39. then you shall hearken from the heaven, from out of [2prepared 3home 1your], and you will be propitious, and you will act, and you will impute to a man according to all  his ways, as you know  his heart; for you alone know the heart of all of the sons of men;

40. so that they should fear you all the days which they live upon the earth which you gave to our fathers.

41. And to the alien who is not from  your people -- this Israel, that shall come from a land far off on account of  your name,

42. for they shall hear  [3name 1your  2great], and  [3hand 1your  2strong], and  [3arm 1your  2high], and shall come and pray to  this place;

43. then you shall listen from the heaven, from [2prepared 3home 1your], and you shall act according to all what [3should call upon 4you 1the 2alien], so that [6should know 1all 2the 3peoples 4of the 5land]  your name, so that they should fear you, as  your people Israel, and should know that  your name has been called upon  in this house, which I built.

44. And if [2should go forth  1your people] to war against  their enemies, in the way which you shall send them, and they shall pray in the name of the lord by way of the city which you chose in it, and the house which I built to your name;

45. then you shall listen from the heaven to their supplication, and  their prayer, and shall do  justice to them.

46. If it be that they shall sin against you, for there is no man who shall not sin, and if you should strike upon them, and should deliver them up before their enemies, and [3should take them captive 1the ones 2taking captive] into a land far or near;

47. and they shall turn  their hearts in the land which they were led away there, and they shall turn and beseech you in the land  of their displacement, saying, We sinned, we acted lawlessly, we did wrong;

48. and they shall turn to you with [2entire  3heart 1their], and with [2entire  3soul 1their] in the land  of their enemies who led them away, and should pray to you by way  of their land which you gave to their fathers, and of the city which you chose, and of the house of which I constructed to your name;

49. then you shall listen from the heaven, from [2prepared 3home 1your],  of their prayer and  their supplication, and you shall do the just thing for them,

50. and you shall be propitious to their iniquities which they sinned against you, and according to all  their wickednesses which ever they disregarded. And you shall appoint them for compassions before the ones capturing them, and they shall pity them.

51. For they are your people, and your inheritance, whom you led out of the land of Egypt, from out of the midst of the foundry furnace of iron.

52. And let [4be  1your eyes 2and  3your ears] open to the supplication  of your servant, and to the supplication  of your people Israel! to hearken to them in all what ever they should call upon you.

53. For you drew them apart unto yourself for an inheritance from out of all the peoples of the earth, as you spoke by the hand  of your servant Moses, in  your leading out  our fathers from the land of Egypt, O Lord, O lord.

54. And it came to pass as Solomon completed praying to the lord all the prayer, and  this supplication, that he rose up in front of the altar of the lord, having kneeled upon  his knees, and  his hands being opened and spread out unto the heaven.

55. And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel [2voice 1with a great], saying,

56. Blessed be the lord who gave today rest to his people Israel, according to all as many things as he spoke. Not [3perished 2word 1one] in all  [3words 1of his  2good] which he spoke by the hand of Moses  his servant.

57. May [3be 1the lord  2our God] with us as he was with  our fathers. May he not abandon us, nor turn from us;

58. but to incline our heart to himself,  to go in all  his ways, and to guard all  his commandments, and  his orders, and  his judgments, which he gave charge to our fathers.

59. And let [2be  1these words] which I have beseeched before the lord our God today, approaching to the lord our God day and night,  to do the right action  for your servant, and the right action  for your people Israel -- [2matter 1a days] in  its day!

60. How that [6should know 1all 2the 3peoples 4of the 5earth] that the lord  God -- he is God, and is there no other.

61. And let [2be  1our hearts] perfect to the lord  our God!  [2sacredly 1to go] by  his orders, and to keep  his commandments as  this day.

62. And the king, and all the sons of Israel sacrificed a sacrifice before the lord.

63. And [3sacrificed  1king 2Solomon] the sacrifices of the peace offerings which he sacrificed to the lord -- [5oxen 1two 2and 3twenty 4thousand], and [5sheep 1a hundred 2and 3twenty 4thousand]. And [3dedicated 4the 5house 6of the lord 1the 2king], and with all the sons of Israel.

64. In  that day [3sanctified 1the 2king] the middle of the courtyard  in front of the house of the lord; for he prepared there the whole burnt-offering, and the sacrifice offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the altar  of brass  before the lord was small  so as to not be able to receive the whole burnt-offering, and the gift offering, and the sacrifices of the peace offerings.

65. And Solomon observed the holiday feast in  that day, and  Israel with him, [2assembly 1a great] from the entering of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the lord our God seven days and seven days -- four and ten days.

66. And on the [2day  1eighth] he sent out the people, and they blessed the king. And [2went forth 1each] unto  his tent rejoicing, and with good heart over the good things which the lord did to David his servant, and  to Israel  his people.  

## 1 Kings 9

1.  God Speaks to Solomon a Second Time And it came to pass as Solomon completed constructing the house of the lord, and the house of the king, and all the matters of Solomon, as many things as he wanted to do,

2. that the lord appeared  to Solomon the second time, as he appeared to him in Gibeon.

3. And [2said 3to 4him 1the lord], I heard  your prayer and  your supplication, which you beseeched before me. I sanctified  this house which you built,  to establish  my name there into the eon. And [4will be  1my eyes 2and  3my heart] there all the days.

4. And you, if you should go before me as [2David went  1your father], in sacredness of heart, and in straightness,  to do according to all which I gave charge to him, and  [2my orders 3and  4my commandments 1you should keep],

5. then I will raise up the throne  of your kingdom over Israel into the eon, as I spoke to your father David, saying, There shall not be removed from you a man leading in Israel. 

6.  God Warns Solomon But if by turning, you should turn, you and  your children, from me and  my orders which I put before you, so as to not keep, and you should go and should serve [2gods 1other], and should do obeisance to them;

7. then I will remove  Israel from the land which I gave to them,; and  this house which I sanctified to my name I shall throw away from my face. And Israel will be for extinction and for a discussion among all the peoples.

8. And  [3house 1this  2lofty], every one  traveling by it shall be amazed, and shall whistle. And they shall say, For what reason did the lord do thus to this land, and to this house?

9. And they shall say, Because they abandoned the lord  their God, the one leading  their fathers from out of the house of slavery of Egypt, and they took hold of alien gods, and did obeisance to to them, and served to them. On account of this the lord brought upon them all  this evil.

10. And it came to pass after twenty years in which Solomon constructed the two houses, the house of the lord, and the house of the king,

11. Hiram the king of Tyre assisted  Solomon with timbers of cedars, and with timbers of pines, and in gold, and in all his want. Then [3gave  1king 2Solomon]  to Hiram twenty cities in the land  of Galilee.

12. And Hiram came forth from out of Tyre, and went to  Galilee  to behold the cities which [2gave 3to him 1Solomon], and they did not please him.

13. And Hiram said, What are  these cities which you gave to me, O brother? And he called them The Border until  this day.

14. And Hiram sent  to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold.

15. And this is the matter of the plunder which [3brought  1king 2Solomon] to build the house of the lord, and the house of the king, and the wall of Jerusalem, and the Akra  to enclose the barrier of the city of David, and  Hazor, and  Megiddo, and  Gezer.

16. Pharaoh king of Egypt ascended and first took  Gezer, and he burnt it by fire, and the Canaanite  dwelling in the city he put to death, and [2gave 3it 1Pharaoh] as a dowry to his daughter -- to the wife of Solomon.

17. And Solomon built  Gezer, and  Beth-horon the lower,

18. and  Baalath, and  Tadmor in the wilderness,

19. and all the cities, the ones fortified which were to Solomon, and all the cities of the chariots, and all the cities of the horsemen, and the matters which Solomon engaged in to construct in Jerusalem, and in  Lebanon, and in all the land  of his dominion.

20. All the remaining people from the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite of the ones not being of the sons of Israel,

21.  their children  being left with them in the land, which [4were not 5able 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to utterly destroy them, that [2led 3them 1Solomon] into tribute until  this day.

22. And from the sons of Israel [2did not give 1Solomon] one for servitude, for they were men  warriors, and his servants, and rulers, and his third rank, and rulers  of his chariots, and his horsemen.

23. [3were 1And 2the rulers] (the ones having knowledge over the works of Solomon) five hundred fifty dominating among the people  doing  work.

24. [2the 3daughter 1And]  of Pharaoh ascended from the city of David to  her house, which he built to her. Then he built Millo.

25. And Solomon offered thrice in a year whole burnt-offerings and peace offerings upon the altar, the one he built to the lord. And he burnt incense upon it, the one which was before the lord, and he finished the house.

26. And [3made  1king 2Solomon] a ship in Ezion Geber, the city being next to Eloth, upon the edge of the sea of the extreme part, in the land of Edom.

27. And Hiram sent in the ship  [3of his servants, 1men 2mariners], people knowing to row the sea with the servants of Solomon.

28. And they came unto Ophir, and took from there four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.  

## 1 Kings 10

1.  The Queen of Sheba Tests Solomon And the queen of Sheba heard the name of Solomon, and the name of the lord, and she came  to test him with enigmas.

2. And she came to Jerusalem with [3force 2heavy 1an exceedingly], and camels lifting aromatics, and [3gold 2much 1exceedingly], and [3stone 2valuable 1much]. And she went to king Solomon. And she spoke to him all as many things as was in  her heart.

3. And [2explained 3to her 1Solomon] all the words of her questions. There was not a word being overlooked by the king which he did not explain to her.

4. And [3beheld 1the queen 2of Sheba] all the intellect of Solomon, and the house which he built,

5. and the foods for Solomon, and the form of his servants, and the position of his ministers, and  their clothes, and  his wine servers, and  his whole burnt-offering which he offered in the house of the lord; and [2beside 3herself 1she was].

6. And she said to  king Solomon, [3is true 1The 2word] which I heard in  my land concerning the word about you, and concerning  your intellect.

7. And I did not trust in the ones speaking to me, until of which I came and [2have seen  1my eyes]. And behold, it is not according to the half as they reported to me. You have added wisdom and good things over all the report which I heard in  my land.

8. Blessed are  your wives, and blessed are  [2your servants 1these]  standing before you continually, the ones hearing  your intellect.

9. May [3be 1the lord  2your God] blessing whom he wants by you, to put you upon the throne of Israel; because  the lord loves  Israel to establish it into the eon, and to set you for king over them,  to execute judgment in righteousness, and in their equity.

10. And she gave  to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and [3spices 2much 1exceedingly], and [2stone 1valuable]. There had not come as  those spices yet in multitude which [3gave 1the queen 2of Sheba]  to king Solomon.

11. And the ship of Hiram, the one carrying the gold from out of Ophir, brought [4timbers 3hewn 2much 1exceedingly], and [2stone 1valuable].

12. And [3made 1the 2king] the [2timbers  1hewn] for supports of the house of the lord, and the house of the king, and stringed instruments, and lutes for the singers. There had not come such [2timbers 1unhewn] unto the land, nor was seen somewhere until  this day.

13. And  king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all as much as she wanted, and as much as she asked, outside of all which was given to her through the hand  of king Solomon. And she returned and came unto  her land, she and  her servants.

14. And was the weight of the gold that came  to Solomon in [2year 1one] -- six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,

15. apart from the tribute of the ones submitting, and the merchants, and all the kings of the other side of the Jordan, and the satraps of the land.

16. And [3made  1king 2Solomon] two hundred spears of gold hammered out -- six hundred weights of gold was used for the [2spear  1one].

17. And he made three hundred oblong shields of gold hammered out. Three minas of gold were used for the [2oblong shield  1one]. And [3put 4them 1the 2king] in the house of the forest  of Lebanon.

18. And [3made 1the 2king 6throne 5ivory 4a great], and he gilded it [2gold 1in unadulterated].

19. there were Six stairs to the throne, and the upper part had calves from the places behind it to the throne. And There were hand rails on this side and that side upon the place of the chair, and two lions standing by the hand rails.

20. And there were twelve lions standing upon the six stairs on this side and that side. There was not such in any kingdom.

21. And all the vessels, the ones used by  Solomon, were of gold. And bathing tubs of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest  of Lebanon [2of gold 1were completely]. And there was no silver, for it was not thought anything in the days of Solomon. 

22.  Solomon Constructs the Wall of Jerusalem For a ship of Tarshish belonged to king Solomon upon the sea with the ships of Hiram. One [5every 6three 7years 2came 3to the 4king 1ship] out of Tarshish with gold and silver, and [4stones 1turned 2and 3hewn].

23. And Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth in riches and intellect.

24. And all the kings of the earth sought the face of Solomon  to hear  of his intellect, which the lord put in  his heart.

25. And [4to him 2brought 1each  3his gifts], items of silver, and items of gold, and clothes, balsam and spices, and horses, and mules  according to year by year.

26. And Solomon brought chariots and horsemen. And there were to him a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he put them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.

27. And [3put 1the 2king] the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he put as the sycamine trees  in the plain in multitude.

28. And the exiting of the horsemen of Solomon was from out of Egypt. And from out of Kue the merchants of the king took merchandise from out of Kue in barter.

29. And there ascended  an exiting from out of Egypt -- a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for a hundred fifty pieces of silver. And thus for all the kings of the Hittites, and to the kings of Syria, by their hand they came forth.  

## 1 Kings 11

1.  Solomon's Heart Is Turned to Other Gods And  king Solomon was fond of women, and he took [2wives 1alien], and the daughter of Pharaoh, and Moabitish, and Ammonitish, and Edomites, and Sidonians, and Hittites.

2. of the nations which the lord forbade to the sons of Israel, saying, You shall not enter to them, and they shall not enter to you; that they should not turn aside  your hearts after  their idols -- for of them Solomon cleaved  to love.

3. And there were to him [2wives 3being female rulers 1seven hundred], and [2concubines 1three hundred]. And [2inclined away  1his wives]  his heart.

4. And it came to pass in a time of old age of Solomon,  his wives turned aside  his heart after other gods. And [2was not  1his heart] perfect with the lord  his God, as was the heart of David  his father.

5. And Solomon went after  Ashtoreth god of the Sidonians, and after  Milcom the abomination of Ammon.

6. And Solomon did  evil before the lord, and did not go after the lord as David  his father.

7. Then Solomon built a high place  to Chemosh, the idol of Moab, in the mountain  before Jerusalem, and to Molech the idol of the sons of Ammon.

8. And thus he did for all  [3wives 1his  2alien], ones burning incense and sacrificing to their idols.

9. And the lord was provoked to anger at Solomon, for he turned aside  his heart from the lord God of Israel -- the one appearing to him twice,

10. after being given charge to him, for  this word  thoroughly, to not go after other gods. And he did not guard what [2gave charge 3to him 1the lord]. 

11.  Judgment Pronounced against Solomon And the lord said to Solomon, Because these things happened with you, and you did not guard  my commandments, and  my orders, which I gave charge to you, in tearing I will tear up  your kingdom from out of your hand, and I will give it to your servant.

12. Except in  your days I will not do them on account of David  your father -- from out of the hand of your son I will take it.

13. Except the entire  kingdom in no way shall I take. [2chiefdom 1One] I will give to your son because of David  my servant, and because of Jerusalem the city which I chose.

14. And the lord raised up an adversary against Solomon,  Hadad the Edomite; from out of the seed of the kingdom in  Edom.

15. And it happened in  David utterly destroying  Edom, in the going of Joab the ruler of the military to bury the slain, that they smote every male in  Edom;

16. for six months [2laid in wait 3there 1Joab] and all Israel, until of which time he utterly destroyed every man of  Edom.

17. And Hadad ran away, he and the Edomite men of the servants  of his father with him. And they entered into Egypt. And Hadad [2boy 1was a small].

18. And they rose up out of Midian, and came into Paran. And they took men with themselves, and they came to Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Hadad entered to Pharaoh. And he gave to him a house, and [2bread loaves 1ordered] for him, and [2land 1gave] to him.

19. And Hadad found favor before Pharaoh, exceedingly. And he gave to him a wife, the sister  of his wife -- the [2sister 3of Tahpenes  1the older].

20. And [4bore 5to him 1the 2sister 3of Tahpenes], to Hadad,  Genubath her son. And [2nourished 3him 1Tahpenes] in the midst of the house of Pharaoh. And Genubath was in the house of Pharaoh in the midst of the sons of Pharaoh.

21. And Hadad heard in Egypt that David had gone to sleep with  his fathers, and that [6had died 1Joab 2the 3ruler 4of the 5military]. And Hadad said to Pharaoh, Send me, and I will return unto  my land.

22. And Pharaoh said to Hadad, What do you lack with me, that behold, you seek to go forth into  your land? And [2said 3to him 1Hadad], Not one thing, but by sending you shall send me.

23. And God raised up an adversary against him,  Rezon son of Eliadah, who fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah, his master.

24. And [2were gathered together 3against 4him 1the men], and he was ruler of the confederation, and he first took  Damascus, and he settled in it, and he reigned in Damascus.

25. And there was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon. This is the evil which Hadad did, and oppressed against Israel, and he reigned in the land of Edom.

26. And Jeroboam son of Nebat the Ephrathite from  Zereda, son [2woman 1of a widow], was a servant  of Solomon.

27. And this was the thing he did as he lifted up the hand against  king Solomon. And  king Solomon built the Akra, and he completed the barrier of the city of David  his father.

28. And the man Jeroboam was strong in power. And Solomon saw the young man that [2a man 3of works 1he is], and he placed him over the tribute of the house of Joseph. 

29.  Ahijah Prophesies the Division of the Kingdom And it came to pass in  that time that Jeroboam came forth out of Jerusalem, and [6found 7him 1Ahijah 2the 3Shilonite 4the 5prophet] in the way; and Ahijah separated him from the way. And Ahijah was wearing [2cloak 1a new], and both were alone in the plain.

30. And Ahijah took hold of  his own cloak, the new one  upon him, and he tore it into twelve pieces.

31. And he said  to Jeroboam, Take for yourself ten pieces! for thus says the lord  God of Israel, Behold, I tear the kingdom from out of the hand of Solomon, and I give to you ten chiefdoms.

32. And two chiefdoms will be his, on account of  my servant David, and on account of Jerusalem the city which I chose in it from out of all the tribes of Israel;

33. because he abandoned me, and offered unto Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and  to Chemosh the idol of Moab, and to Milcom the loathsome thing of the sons of Ammon. And he did not go in  my ways  to do the upright thing before me, and  my orders, and  my ordinances, as [3did 1David  2his father].

34. And in no way will I take the kingdom entirely from his hand (for by resisting I shall resist him all the days  of his life) because of David  my servant -- whom I chose him, who guarded the commandments and  my ordinances.

35. And I shall take the kingdom from out of the hand  of his son, and I will give to you the ten chiefdoms.

36.  But to his son I will give the two chiefdoms, so that there might be a designation to my servant David all the days before me in Jerusalem, the city which I chose for myself  to put  my name there.

37. And you shall take, and you shall reign in wherever [2desires  1your soul], and you will be king over Israel.

38. And it will be if you should guard all as much as I gave charge to you, and should go in  my ways, and do the upright thing before me,  to keep  my orders, and  my commandments, as did David  my servant; then I will be with you, and I shall build for you [2house 1a sure], as I built  for David.

39. And I will give to you  Israel, and I will mistreat the seed of David on account of these things, except not for all the days. 

40.  Jeroboam Flees from Solomon And Solomon sought  to put Jeroboam to death. And he rose up, and ran away unto Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt. And he was in Egypt until Solomon died.

41. And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all as many things as he did, and all  his intellect -- behold, have not these been written in the scroll of the sayings of Solomon?

42. And the days which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem was forty years over all Israel.

43. And Solomon slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him in the city of David  his father. And [3reigned 1Rehoboam  2his son] instead of him.  

## 1 Kings 12

1.  Rehoboam Abandons the Counsel of the Elders And [3went  1king 2Rehoboam] to Shechem, for [4unto 5Shechem 3came 1all 2Israel] to give him reign.

2. And it came to pass as [4heard 1Jeroboam 2son 3of Nebat], and he was still being in Egypt, as he had fled from the face  of king Solomon, and settled in Egypt,

3. that they sent and called him. And Jeroboam came and all the people of Israel. And [3spoke 1the 2people] to  king Rehoboam, saying,

4.  Your father hardened  our neck yoke. And you now, lighten of  [3servitude  4of your father 1the 2hard], and from  [3neck yoke 1his  2heavy]! of which he put upon us, and we will serve to you.

5. And he said to them, Go forth for [2days 1three], and return to me! And they went forth.

6. And [3reported  1king 2Rehoboam] to the elders, the ones who were standing before Solomon  his father [2was still 3living 1while he], saying, How do you counsel that I should answer to this people a word?

7. And they spoke to him, saying, If in  this day you will be a servant  to this people, and should serve them, and shall speak to them [2words 1with good], then they will be to you servants all the days.

8. And he abandoned the counsel of the elders which they advised him, and he took up advice with the young men  being brought up with him, of the ones standing before his face.

9. And he said to them, What do you advise, and what should I answer  to this people  speaking to me, saying, Lighten up the neck yoke which [2put  1your father] upon us?

10. And they spoke to him, the young men  having been brought up with him; and they said, Thus you shall speak  to this people, to the ones speaking to you, saying,  Your father oppressed  our neck yoke, and you now lighten it from us! Thus you shall say to them,  My thinness [2thicker than 1is] the loin  of my father.

11. And now,  my father saddled you with [2neck yoke 1a heavy], and I will add unto  your neck yoke.  My father corrected you with whips, but I will correct you with scorpions.

12. And Jeroboam came, and all Israel to  king Rehoboam on the [2day  1third] as [3spoke 4to them 1the 2king], saying, Return to me  [3day 1the 2third]!

13. And [3answered 1the 2king] to the people hard. And Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the elders which they advised him.

14. And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying,  My father oppressed  your neck yoke, and I shall add to  your neck yoke.  My father corrected you with whips, and I will correct you with scorpions.

15. And [3did not 4hear 1the 2king] the people, for he was converted by the lord, so that [2should stand  1his word], which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite over Jeroboam son of Nebat.

16. And [3knew 1all 2Israel] that [3did not hearken to 4them 1the 2king]. And [3answered 1the 2people] to the king, saying, What is our portion with David? and, There is no inheritance to us with the son of Jesse. Run, O Israel, to  your tents! Now graze  your own house, David! And Israel went forth to  his tents.

17. And the sons of Israel, the ones dwelling in the cities of Judah -- [2reigned 3over 4them  1Rehoboam].

18. And [3sent  1king 2Rehoboam]  Adoram, the one for collecting the tribute. And [3stoned 4him 5with 6stones 1all 2Israel], and he died. And  king Rehoboam anticipated to ascend upon the chariot  to flee into Jerusalem.

19. And Israel annulled allegiance with the house of David until  this day. 

20.  Jeroboam Reigns in Israel And it came to pass as [3heard 1all 2Israel] that Jeroboam returned from out of Egypt, that they sent and called him to the congregation. And they gave him reign over Israel. And there was none following after the house of David except the chiefdom of Judah and Benjamin only.

21. And Rehoboam entered into Jerusalem, and he held an assembly of all the congregation of Judah, and the chiefdom of Benjamin -- a hundred and twenty thousand young men for making war,  to wage war against the house of Israel, to return the kingdom of Rehoboam son of Solomon.

22. And there came to pass the word of the lord to Shemaiah the man  of God, saying,

23. Speak  to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people! saying,

24. Thus says the lord, You shall not ascend, nor wage war with  your brethren of the sons of Israel. Let [2return 1each] to  his house! for from me [2has taken place  1this thing]. And they hearkened to the word of the lord, and they ceased  to go against the thing of the lord.

25. And Jeroboam built  Shechem  in mount Ephraim, and he dwelt in it. And he went forth from there and built  Penuel. 

26.  Jeroboam Makes Two Heifers of Gold And Jeroboam said in  his heart, Behold, now [3shall return 1the 2kingdom] to the house of David,

27. if [2should ascend  1this people] to offer a sacrifice in the house of the lord in Jerusalem, then [5shall turn 1the 2heart 3of the 4people] towards  their master, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me.

28. And [3consulted 1the 2king], and made two heifers of gold. And he said to the people, Let it be enough for you to ascend to Jerusalem! Behold,  your gods, O Israel, the ones leading you from out of the land of Egypt.

29. And he put the one in Beth-el, and the other one he put in Dan.

30. And [3came to pass  2account 1this] for sin. And [3went 1the 2people] after the one unto Dan.

31. And he made houses upon high places, and he appointed priests from any part of the people who were not of the sons of Levi.

32. And Jeroboam made a holiday feast in the [2month  1eighth], on the fifteenth day of the month, according to the holiday, the one in  Judah. And he ascended unto the altar which he made in Beth-el,  to sacrifice to the heifers which he made. And he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he made.

33. And he ascended unto the altar which he made in the fifteenth day in the [2month  1eighth], in the holiday which he shaped out of his own heart. And he made the holiday for the sons of Israel, and he ascended unto the altar  to sacrifice upon it.  

## 1 Kings 13

1.  The Man of God from Beth-el And behold, a man  of God came from out of Judah with a word of the lord unto Beth-el. And Jeroboam stood upon the altar to sacrifice.

2. And he called upon the altar with the word of the lord, and said, O altar, O altar, thus says the lord, Behold, a son is born to the house of David, Josiah is his name, and he shall sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places, the ones sacrificing upon you, and bones of men he shall burn upon you.

3. And he executed in  that day a miracle, saying, This is the saying which the lord spoke, saying, Behold, the altar is torn, and [6shall be poured out 1the 2fatness  3being 4upon 5it].

4. And it came to pass as [3heard  1king 2Jeroboam] the words of the man  of God. of the one calling upon the altar  in Beth-el, that he stretched out  his hand from the altar, saying, Seize him! And [2withered  1his hand] which he stretched out against him, and he was not able to return it to himself.

5. And the altar tore, and [3poured out 1the 2fatness] from the altar, according to the portent which [4gave 1the 2man  3of God] by the word of the lord.

6. And [3answered 1the 2king], and said to the man  of God, Beseech the face of the lord  your God, and return  my hand to me! And [4beseeched 1the 2man  3of God] the face of the lord, and [5returned 1the 2hand 3of the 4king] to him, and it became as  formerly.

7. And [3spoke 1the 2king] to the man  of God, Enter with me to  my house and dine, and I will give to you a gift!

8. And [4said 1the 2man  3of God] to the king, If you should give to me  half  of your house, I will not enter with you, neither will I eat bread, nor drink water in  this place.

9. For thus [2gave charge 3to me 1the lord] by a word, saying, In no way should you eat bread, nor in any way should you drink water, nor in any way should you return in the way in which you came by it.

10. And he went forth by [2way 1another], and did not return in the way which he came by it unto Beth-el. 

11.  The Prophet Tests the Man of God And a prophet, one old man, dwelt in Beth-el. And [2came  1his sons] and described to him all the works which [4did 1the 2man  3of God] in  that day in Beth-el, and the words which he spoke to the king. And they turned the face  of their father.

12. And [2said 3to 4them  1their father], saying, Which way has he went? And [2showed 3to him  1his sons] the way which [4went 1the 2man  3of God], the one coming from out of Judah.

13. And he said to his sons, Saddle for me the donkey! And they saddled for him the donkey. And he mounted upon him,

14. and he went after the man  of God. And he found him sitting down under the oak. And he said to him, Are you the man  of God, the one coming from out of Judah? And he said, I am.

15. And he said to him, Come with me, and eat bread!

16. And he said, In no way am I able  to return with you, nor should I eat bread, nor in any way should I drink water in  this place.

17. For so it has been given charge to me by the word of the lord, saying, You shall not eat bread there, and you shall not drink water, and you shall not return there in the way in which you went by it.

18. And he said to him, And I am a prophet as you, and an angel spoke to me by word of the lord, saying, Return him with yourself to  your house, and let him eat bread, and drink water! But he lied to him.

19. And he returned him, and he ate bread, and he drank water in  his house. 

20.  The Prophet Rebukes the Man of God And it came to pass of them sitting down at the table, that [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to the prophet, the one having returned him.

21. And he said to the man  of God, the one having come from out of Judah, saying, Thus says the lord, Because you rebelled against the saying of the lord, and did not guard the commandment which [3gave charge 4to you 1the lord  2your God],

22. but you returned and ate bread, and drank water in  this place, in which he spoke to you, saying, You shall not eat bread nor drink water -- in no way shall [3enter  2body 1your] into the burying-place  of your fathers.

23. And it came to pass after  he ate bread and drank water, that he saddled for him the donkey, for the prophet, and he returned.

24. And he went forth. And [2found 3him 1a lion] in the way, and it killed him. And [2was  1his body] tossed in the way, and the donkey stood by it, and the lion stood by the body.

25. And behold, men coming near also beheld the decaying flesh tossed in the way, and the lion standing next to the decaying flesh. And they entered and spoke in the city of which the prophet, the old man, dwelt in it.

26. And [7heard 1the one 2returning 3him 4from out of 5the 6way], and said, [3the 4man  5of God 1This 2is] who rebelled against the word of the lord; and [2gave 3him 1the lord] to the lion, and it broke him, and it killed him, according to the word of the lord which he spoke to him.

27. And he spoke to  his sons, saying, Saddle for me the donkey! And they saddled it.

28. And he went and found  his body having been tossed in the way, and the donkey and the lion were standing by the body, and [3did not 4eat 1the 2lion] the body, and it did not tear apart the donkey.

29. And [3lifted 1the 2prophet] the body of the man  of God, and he placed it upon the donkey, and he returned it to the city of the [2prophet  1old],  to lament and to entomb him.

30. And he put  his body in  his tomb; and they lamented him, saying, Woe O brother.

31. And it came to pass after  lamenting him, that he said to his sons, saying, If I die, entomb me in  this tomb in which the man  of God was entombed in it! [3by  4his bones 1Put 2me]! that [3should be preserved  2bones 1my] with  his bones.

32. For [8coming to pass 7will be 1the 2saying 3which 4he spoke 5by the word 6of the lord] against the altar in Beth-el, and against the houses of the high places, of the ones in Samaria.

33. And after  this saying [2did not 3turn 1Jeroboam] from  his evil, but he returned and appointed from part of the people priests of the high places. The one wanting to be a priest he filled the post  by his hand, and he became priest of the high places.

34. And it came to pass  this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, and for ruin, and for extinction from the face of the earth.  

## 1 Kings 14

1.  Jeroboam's Wife Goes to Ahijah the Prophet In  that time [4was ill 1Abijah 2son 3of Jeroboam].

2. And [3to 4his wife 2said 1Jeroboam], Rise up and change that they shall not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go unto Shiloh! Behold, [4is there 1Ahijah 2the 3prophet], he spoke unto me  to reign over  this people.

3. And take in  your hand ten bread loaves, and small cakes, and a jar of honey, and you shall go to him. He will announce to you what will be to the child.

4. And [4did 5thus 1the 2wife 3of Jeroboam]. And she rose up, and went to Shiloh, and she entered into the house of Ahijah. And the man was old  for seeing, and [2were blunted  1his eyes] from  his old age.

5. And the lord said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam enters  to seek an utterance from you concerning her son, for he is ill. According to this and according to that you shall speak to her. And it came to pass in  her entering that she was as a stranger.

6. And it came to pass as Ahijah heard the sound of her feet of her entering in the passage, that he said, Enter, O wife of Jeroboam! why is this you are as a stranger, and I am [2envoy 3to 4you 1a harsh]? 

7.  Ahijah Speaks Judgment against Jeroboam In going, say to Jeroboam, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, Because as much as I exalted you from the midst of the people, and appointed you leading over the people of Israel,

8. and tore the crown of state from the house of David, and gave it to you; and yet you have not become as  my servant David, who kept  my commandments, and who went after me with all his heart,  to do the upright thing in my eyes.

9. But you did wickedly  doing more than all as many as were in front of you. And you went and made for yourself other gods, and molten images,  to provoke me to anger, and tossed me behind you.

10. On account of this behold, I bring evil to the house of Jeroboam, and I will utterly destroy of Jeroboam the one urinating against a wall, the one coming and the one being left behind in Israel. And I shall choose over the house of Jeroboam as one chooses the dung unto finishing it.

11. The one having died  of Jeroboam in the city [3shall devour 1the 2dogs]. And the one having died in the field [4shall devour 1the 2birds  3of heaven]; for the lord spoke.

12. And you, rising up, go unto your house! In the entering [2feet 1of your] in the city [3shall die 1the 2child].

13. And [3shall lament 4him 1all 2Israel], and entomb him, for this one only shall enter  of Jeroboam to the tomb, for there shall be found in him [2word 1a good] concerning  the lord God of Israel among the house of Jeroboam.

14. And the lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall strike the house of Jeroboam this  day, and yet also indeed now.

15. And the lord shall strike  Israel as [2shaken  1a reed] in the water. And he shall pluck out  Israel upward  [3soil  2good 1of this] of which he gave to their fathers. And he shall winnow them on the other side of the river, because of as many [2they made  1of their sacred groves], provoking [3to anger 1the 2 lord].

16. And the lord gave  Israel favor from the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and who led Israel into sin.

17. And [4rose up 1the 2wife 3of Jeroboam], and went unto Tizrah. And it came to pass as she entered in the threshold of the house, that the child died.

18. And they entombed it, and [3lamented 4it 1all 2Israel], according to the word of the lord, the word he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.

19. And the extra things of Jeroboam, as much as he waged war, and as much as he reigned, behold, they are written in the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Israel.

20. And the days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty and two years. And he slept with  his fathers, and [3reigned 1Nadab 2his son] instead of him.

21. And Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned over Judah. [2a son 3being forty 4and 5one 6years old 1Rehoboam was] in  his being given reign. And seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, in the city in which the lord chose to put  his name there from all of the tribes  of Israel. And the name  of his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess.

22. And Judah acted  wickedly before the lord, and provoked him to jealousy in all the things which [2did  1his fathers] in  their sins which they sinned.

23. And they built for themselves high places, and monuments, and sacred groves upon every [2hill 1high], and underneath every [2tree 1shady].

24. And bonding together took place in the land, and they did from all the abominations of the nations which the lord removed in front of the sons of Israel. 

25.  Shishak Comes against Jerusalem And it came to pass in the [2year  1fifth] of the reigning of Rehoboam, [4ascended 1Shishak 2king 3of Egypt] against Jerusalem.

26. And he took all the treasures of the house of the lord, and the treasures of the house of the king, even the whole he took, and the shields  of gold which Solomon made.

27. And [4made 1Rehoboam 2the 3king] shields of brass instead of them, and [5were set in place 6by 7him 1the 2leaders 3of the 4bodyguards], the ones guarding the vestibule of the house of the king.

28. And it came to pass when [3entered 1the 2king] into the house of the lord, that [3lifted 4them 1the 2bodyguards], and fastened them in the vestibule of the bodyguards.

29. And the rest of the words of Rehoboam, and all the things which he did, [4not 1behold 3these 2are] written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

30. And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days.

31. And Rehoboam slept with  his fathers. And they entombed him with  his fathers in the city of David. And the name  of his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. And [3reigned 1Abijam 2his son] instead of him.

2. And three years he reigned in Jerusalem, and the name  of his mother was Maachah daughter of Abishalom.

3. And he went in the sins  of his father which he did before him. And [2was not  1his heart] perfect with the lord his God, as the heart of David  his grand father.

4. But on account of David [3gave 4to him 1the lord  2his God] a vestige in Jerusalem, that he should establish  his children after him, and establish  Jerusalem,

5. as David did the upright thing before the lord, and did not turn aside from all which he gave charge to him, all the days  of his life,

6. except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. And war was between Rehoboam and between Jeroboam all the days  of his life.

7. And the rest of the words of Abijam and all the things which he did, [4not 1behold 3these 2are] written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and between Jeroboam.

11. And Asa did the upright thing before the lord as David  his father.

12. And he removed the mystic rites from the land, and sent out all the practices which [2did  1his fathers].

13. And  [2Maachah  3his mother 1he removed]  so as to not be ruling, as she observed a convocation in  her sacred grove. And Asa cut off  her retreats, and he burnt them in fire at the rushing stream Kidron.

14. But the high places he removed not. Except the heart of Asa was perfect with the lord all  his days.

15. And Asa carried into the house of the lord the monumental pillars  of his father, and the monumental pillars  of silver and of gold, and he carried into the house of the lord silver and gold and vessels. 

16.  Israel Wars with Judah And there was war between Asa and between Baasha king of Israel all  their days.

17. And [4ascended 1Baasha 2king 3of Israel] against Judah, and he built  Ramah, so as not to be going forth and entering to Asa king of Judah.

18. And Asa took all the silver and the gold  being found in the treasuries of the house of the lord, and in the treasuries of the house of the king; and he put them into the hands  of his servants. And [3sent 4them  1king 2Asa] to the son of Hadad, son of Tabrimon, son of Hezion, king of Syria, the one dwelling in Damascus, saying,

19. A covenant between me and between you, and between  my father and  your father! Behold, I have sent to you gifts of silver and of gold, come efface  your covenant  with Baasha king of Israel! and he shall ascend from me.

20. And [3hearkened 1the son 2of Hadad]  to king Asa, and he sent the rulers  of his force in to the cities  of Israel. And he struck  Ijon, and  Dan, and  Abel of the house of Maachah, and all  Cinneroth, unto all the land of Naphtali.

21. And it came to pass when Baasha heard, that he stopped the building  of Ramah, and he returned unto Tizrah.

22. And  king Asa exhorted all Judah with no exceptions. And they lifted the stones  of Ramah, and  its timbers, which Baasha constructed. And [4built 5with 6them 1Asa 2the 3king] the hill of Benjamin, and the height.

23. And the rest of the words of Asa, and all  his dominion, and all which he did, and the cities which he built, [4not 1behold 3these 5written 2are] upon a scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Only in the time  of his old age [2caused pain  1his feet].

27. And [8besieged 9against 10him 1Baasha 2son 3of Ahijah 4over 5the 6house 7of Issachar], and he struck him in Gibbethon, the city of the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were besieging at Gibbethon.

29.  Baasha Strikes the House of Jeroboam And it came to pass as he reigned, he struck the entire  house of Jeroboam; and he left not any that breathed  of Jeroboam, until  utterly destroying him, (according to the saying of the lord, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the Shilonite,)

30. for the sins of Jeroboam, which he led Israel into sin, and in  his provoking to anger in which he provoked to anger the lord God  of Israel.

2. Because I exalted you above the earth, and gave you lead over  my people Israel, and you went in the way of Jeroboam, and led [3into sin  1my people 2Israel],  to provoke me to anger by  their vanities;

3. behold, I arouse enemies after Baasha, and after  his house. And I will appoint  your house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat.

4. The one having died  of Baasha in the city, [3shall eat 4him 1the 2dogs]. And the one having died of his in the plain, [5shall eat 6him 1the 2birds 3of the 4heaven].

8.  Elah Reigns in Israel In the eighth and twentieth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha reigned over Israel in Tirzah two years.

9. And [2was confederated 3against 4him  1his servant] -- Zimri the ruler  of half the chariots. And Elah was in Tirzah drinking, being intoxicated in the house of Azra the manager, the one in Tirzah.

17. And Omri ascended from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged against Tizrah. 

18.  The Death of Zimri And it came to pass as Zimri beheld that [3was taken 1his  2city], that he entered into the inner room of the house of the king, and he set on fire [5over 6himself 1the 2house 3of the 4king] with fire, and he died

## 1 Kings 17

1.  Elijah the Tishbite And [4said 1Elijah 2the 3Tishbite], the one from Tishbon  of Gilead, to Ahab, As the lord lives, the God of Israel, in whom I stand before him, Shall there be  these years dew and rain, no, but unless it be through the word of my mouth.

2. And came to pass the saying of the lord to Elijah.

3. Go from here according to the east, and hide at the rushing stream Cherith, to the one upon the face of the Jordan!

4. And it will be from out of the rushing stream you shall drink water, and to the crows I shall give charge  to nourish you there.

5. And [2went 3and 4did 1Elijah] according to the saying of the lord. And he settled by the rushing stream Cherith upon the face of the Jordan.

6. And the crows brought to him bread loaves and meat in the morning, and bread loaves and meat in the afternoon. And from out of the rushing stream he drank water.

7. And it came to pass after many days, that [3dried up 1the 2rushing stream], for there was no rain upon the earth.

8. And [3came to pass 1the word 2of the lord] to Elijah, saying,

9. Rise up, and go into Sarepta of the Sidonians! and you shall dwell there. Behold, I have given charge there [2woman 1for a widow]  to nourish you. 

10.  Elijha and the Widow of Sarepta And he rose up and went into Sarepta. And he came unto the gate-house of the city. And behold, there [2woman 1a widow] was collecting together wood. And [2yelled out 3after 4her 1Elijah], and said to her, Take indeed for me a little water into a container, and I shall drink.

11. And she went to take, and [2yelled out 3after 4her 1Elijah], and said to her, Give indeed to me the morsel of bread in  your hand, and I will eat.

12. And [3said 1the 2woman], As [3lives 1the lord  2your God], If there is to me a cake baked in hot ashes -- good? but I have only as much as a handful of flour in the pitcher, and a little olive oil in the jar. And behold, I shall collected together two sticks, and I shall enter and make it for myself and  my children, and we shall eat and die.

13. And [2said 3to 4her 1Elijah], Be of courage! enter and do according to  your word! But make for me from there [2cake baked in hot ashes 1a small] at first, and bring it forth to me! and to yourself you shall make and to your children at last.

14. For thus says the lord  God of Israel, The pitcher  of flour shall not fail, and the jar  of olive oil shall not have less, until the days of the giving by the lord the rain upon the earth.

15. And [3went 1the 2woman] and did according to the word of Elijah; and she gave to him, and he ate, and she, and  her children.

16. And the pitcher  of flour failed not, and the jar  of olive oil had not less, according to the saying of the lord, which he spoke by the hand of Elijah.

17. And it came to pass after these things that [9became ill 1the 2son 3of the 4woman 5who was the 6lady 7of the 8house], and [3was  2illness 1his] fortified very much, until  there was not left behind in him a breath.

18. And she said to Elijah, What is it to me and to you, O man  of God, for you to enter to me,  to call to mind  my iniquities and to kill  my son? 

19.  Elijah Raises the Widow's Son to Life And Elijah said to the woman, Give me  your son! And he took him from out of  her bosom, and brought him into the upper room in which he settled there, and he rested him upon  his bed.

20. And Elijah yelled out to the lord, and he said, O lord  my God, also indeed the widow with whom I dwell with her, have you inflicted evil  to kill  her son?

21. And he breathed into the boy three times, and he called upon the lord, and he said, O lord  my God, return indeed the life  of this boy to him!

22. And it became so, and [5returned 1the 2life 3of the 4boy] to him. And [3yelled out 1the 2boy].

23. And he led him from the upper room into the house, and he gave it to his mother. And Elijah said, See! [2lives  1your son].

24. And [3said 1the 2woman] to Elijah, Behold, I know that [2a man  3of God 1you are], and the word of the lord in  your mouth is true.  

## 1 Kings 18

1.  Elijah Sent to Ahab And it came to pass after [2days 1many], and the word of the lord came to Elijah in  [3year 1the 2third], saying, Go, and appear to Ahab! and I will put rain upon the face of the earth.

2. And Elijah went  to appear to Ahab, and there was [2famine 1a strong] in Samaria.

3. And Ahab called  Obadiah the manager. And Obadiah was fearing the lord exceedingly. 

4.  Obadiah Hides the Prophets And it came to pass when  Jezebel struck the prophets of the lord, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and he hid them by fifty in two caves, and nourished them with bread and water.

5. And Ahab said to Obadiah, Come, and we should go through in the land unto the springs of the waters, and unto all the rushing streams, if perchance we should find pasturage, and we should preserve the horses and mules, and [2shall not be destroyed 3from 4us 1cattle].

6. And they divided to themselves the way  to go by it; Ahab went by [2way 1one], and Obadiah went by [2way 1another] alone.

7. And Obadiah was in the way alone, and behold, Elijah came to meet with him. And Obadiah hastened and fell upon his face, and he said, Are you he, O my master, Elijah? 

8.  Elijah Sends Obadiah to Ahab And Elijah said to him, I am, Go, tell  your master, Behold, Elijah!

9. And Obadiah said, How have I sinned that you appoint  your servant into the hands of Ahab  to kill me?

10. As [3lives 1the lord  2your God], is there a nation or kingdom of which [2did not 3send  1my master] to seek you? And if they said, He is not here; then he adjured the kingdom and  its places, for he did not find you.

11. And now you say, Go announce to your master, Behold, Elijah!

12. And it will be if I should go forth from you, and a wind of the lord shall lift you into the land which I do not know, and I shall enter  to report  to Ahab, and he should not find you, then he will kill me. But  your servant is fearing the lord from out of his youth.

13. Or was it not reported to you,  O my master, what things I have done when  Jezebel killed the prophets of the lord, that I took some of the prophets of the lord -- a hundred men, and I hid them in the caves by fifty, and I maintained them with bread loaves and water?

14. And now you say, Go, tell  your master, Behold, Elijah! and he will kill me.

15. And Elijah said, As [4lives 1the lord 2of the 3forces], in which I stand before him, that today I will appear to him.

16. And Obadiah went to meet with  Ahab, and he reported to him. And Ahab ran forth and went to meet with Elijah.

17. And it came to pass as Ahab saw  Elijah, that Ahab said to Elijah, Are you he  turning aside  Israel? 

18.  Elijah and the Prophets of Baal And Elijah said, I do not turn aside  Israel, but you, and the house  of your father, in  your leaving the lord your God, and to go after the Baalim.

19. And now, send and gather together to me all Israel at  mount  Carmel, and the prophets  of Baal -- four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the sacred groves -- four hundred, eating at the table of Jezebel!

20. And Ahab sent into all  Israel, and he assembled all the prophets to  mount  Carmel.

21. And Elijah came near to all the people, and he said to them, For how long will you be lame upon both  your hams? If the lord is  God, go after him! But if  Baal, go after him! And [3answered not 1the 2people] a word.

22. And Elijah said to the people, I am left [2a prophet 3of the lord 1alone], and the prophets  of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.

23. Give then to us two oxen, and let them choose for themselves  one, and let them dismember it, and place it upon the wood, and [3fire 1do not 2put] upon it! And I will do the same  [2ox  1with the other], and [3fire 1in no way 2will I put] upon it.

24. And you yell out in the name  of your gods, and I will call upon the name of the lord  my God. And it will be the God who ever heeds by fire, this is God. And [4answered 1all 2the 3people] and said, [3is good 1The 2word] which you have spoken.

25. And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose for yourselves the [2ox  1one], and prepare it first! for you are many; and call in the name of your god, and [3fire 1do not 2put] upon it!

26. And they took the ox, and offered it, and they called in the name  of Baal from morning until midday. And they said, Heed us, O Baal, heed us! And there was no sound, and there was no hearing a thing. And they ran upon the altar of which they made.

27. And it became midday, and [4sneered at 5them 1Elijah 2the 3Tishbite], and he said, Call with [2voice 1a great]! perhaps [3in 5meditation 4some 1he is 2himself], and at the same time perhaps [2executing business 1he is], or perhaps he sleeps and shall rise up.

28. And they called out with [2voice 1a great], and mutilated themselves according to  their custom with knives and by spears, until [2poured out 1blood] of them.

29. And they prophesied until of which time it went into the midday. And it came to pass as the time of the midday  to ascend for the sacrifice -- and there was no sound, and there was no hearing.

30. And Elijah said to the people, Come forward to me! And [4came forward 1all 2the 3people] to him. And he repaired the altar, the one having been razed.

31. And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes  of Israel, as the lord spoke to him, saying, Israel will be  your name.

32. And he built the stones in the name of the lord, and he repaired the altar of the lord, the one having been razed. And he made a sea, having the space to hold two measures of seed, round about the altar.

33. And he put the kindling upon the altar which he made. And he dismembered the whole burnt-offering, and he put it upon the kindling, and he piled upon the altar. And Elijah said, Bring to me four [2pitchers 1water], and pour upon the whole burnt-offering, and upon the kindling!

34. And he said, Repeat it a second time! And they repeated it a second time. And he said, Do it a third time! And they did it a third time.

35. And [3went 1the 2water] round about the altar, and the sea filled with water.

36. And as it was time of the offering the sacrifice, and [4came 1Elijah 2the 3prophet] and said, O lord  God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known to all  this people! that you are the lord  God of Israel, and I am your servant, and through you I have done all these things.

37. Heed me, O lord, heed me! And let [2know  1this people] that you are the lord  God! and you turned the heart  of this people back. 

38.  The Whole Burnt-offering and Altar Devoured And [2fell 1fire] from the lord from out of the heaven, and it devoured the whole burnt-offering, and the kindling, and the water  in the sea, and the stones, and the dust was licked up by the fire.

39. And [4saw 1all 2the 3people], and fell upon their face. And they said, Truly, the lord is God. The lord, he is God.

40. And Elijah said to the people, Seize the prophets  of Baal, let not one [3escape 1of 2them]! And they seized them. And [2led them down 1Elijah] unto the rushing stream Kishon, and slew them there.

41. And Elijah said  to Ahab, Ascend, and eat, and drink! for it is the sound of the noise of the rain.

42. And Ahab ascended  to eat and to drink. And Elijah ascended unto  Carmel, and bowed upon the ground, and put  his face between  his knees.

43. And he said to his servant-lad, Ascend, and look the way of the sea! And [3ascended 4and 5looked 1the 2servant-lad]. And he said, There is nothing. And Elijah said, Return seven times!

44. And it came to pass in the seventh time, and behold, [2cloud 1a small] as the sole of a man's foot came with water from the sea. And he said, Ascend and say  to Ahab! Team up  your chariot, and go down, lest [3should overtake 4you 1the 2rain]!

45. And it happened from here and here, and the heaven darkened with clouds and wind, and there became [2rain 1a great]. And Ahab rode horseback, and went unto Jezreel.

46. And the hand of the lord came upon  Elijah, and he fastened  his loin, and he ran in front of Ahab unto Jezreel.  

## 1 Kings 19

1.  Elijah Flees from Jezebel And Ahab announced  to Jezebel all as much as Elijah did, and as to kill the prophets by the broadsword.

2. And Jezebel sent to Elijah, and said, Thus may [3do 4to me 1the 2gods], and thus may they add, that this  hour tomorrow I shall put  your life as the life of one of them.

3. And Elijah feared, and rose up, and went forth for  his life. And he came into Beersheba  of Judah. And he left  his servant-lad there.

4. And he went by the wilderness way a day. And came and stayed underneath a broom shrub, and he asked  for his life to die. And he said, It is fit now, O lord, take indeed  my life from me! for [3no 4better 1I 2am] than  my fathers.

5. And he bedded down and slept there under a plant. And behold, a certain angel touched him, and said to him, Rise up, and eat!

6. And he looked. And behold, by his head was a cake baked in hot ashes of oaten bread, and a jar of water. And Elijah rose up and ate and drank. And he returned and went to bed.

7. And [4returned 1the 2angel 3of the lord]  a second time, and touched him, and said to him, Rise up, eat! for [3is great 4for 5you 1the 2journey].

8. And he rose up, and ate and drank. And he went in the strength  of that food forty days and forty nights unto mount Horeb. 

9.  The LORD Is in the Fine Breeze And he entered there into the cave, and rested up there. And behold, a word of the lord came to him. And he said, Why are you here, Elijah?

10. And Elijah said, Being zealous, I am zealous for the lord almighty, for [4abandoned 5you 1the 2sons 3of Israel].  Your altar they razed, and  your prophets they killed by the broadsword, and [3am left 1I 2alone], and they seek  my life to take it.

11. And he said, You shall go forth and stand before the lord in the mountain! and behold, the lord will go by. And [3wind 1there was a great 2strong] parting the mountains, and breaking rocks before the lord; [2was not 3in 4the 5wind 1but the lord]. And after the wind a rumbling; [2was not 3in 4the 5rumbling 1but the lord].

12. And after the rumbling a fire; [2was not 3in 4the 5fire 1but the lord]. And after the fire a sound [2breeze 1of a fine] -- there was the lord.

13. And it came to pass as Elijah heard, that he covered over  his face with  his sheepskin, and he went forth and stood by the cave. And behold, before him was a voice, and he said, Why are you here, Elijah?

14. And Elijah said, Being zealous, I am zealous for the lord God almighty, for [4abandoned  5your covenant 1the 2sons 3of Israel],  your altars they razed, and  your prophets they killed by the broadsword, and [3am left 1I 2alone], and they seek  my life to take it. 

15.  Elijah Anoints Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha And the lord said to him, Go, return to  your journey! And you shall come unto the way of the wilderness of Damascus, and you shall anoint  Hazael as king over Syria.

16. And  Jehu son of Nimshi you shall anoint as king over Israel. And  Elisha son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet instead of you.

17. And it will be the one being delivered from the broadsword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death. And the one being delivered from the broadsword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death.

18. And I shall leave behind in Israel seven thousand men, all  knees which do not bend the knee  to Baal, and every mouth which does not do obeisance to him.

19. And he went forth from there, and he finds  Elisha son of Shaphat, and he was plowing with oxen. Twelve teams were before him, and he was among the twelve. And [2went forth 3unto  4Elisha 1Elijah], and he tossed upon him  his sheepskin.

20. And Elisha left the oxen, and he ran after Elijah, and said, I shall kiss  my father and  my mother, and I shall follow after you. And he said to him, Go, return! for I have done it to you.

21. And he returned from following after him. And he took the teams  of oxen, and he sacrificed and cooked them by the equipment of the oxen, and he gave to the people and they ate. And he rose up, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.  

## 1 Kings 20

1.  Syria Wages War with Ahab And the son of Hadad king of Syria gathered together all  his force, and thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots. And they ascended, and laid siege against Samaria, and waged war against it.

2. And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and he said to him, Thus says the son of Hadad.

3.  Your silver and  your gold is mine; and  your wives and  your children, the best is mine.

4. And [4answered 1the 2king 3of Israel] and said, As you have spoken, O my master, O king, [3yours 1I 2am], and all my things.

5. And [3returned 1the 2messengers] and said, Thus says the son of Hadad, I have sent to you, saying,  Your silver and  your gold and  your wives and  your children you shall give to me,

6. for this  hour tomorrow I will send  my servants to you, and they will search  your house, and the houses  of your servants. And it will be that all the desires  of their eyes, of what ever they should put upon with  their hands, they shall take.

7. And [4called 1the 2king 3of Israel] all the elders of the land, and he said, Know indeed and behold! that [3evil 1this one 2seeks], for he has sent to me for  my wives, and for  my children. And  my silver and  my gold I have not kept back from him.

8. And [7said 8to him 1the 2elders 3and 4all 5the 6people], You should not hearken, and you should not want.

9. And he said to the messengers of the son of Hadad, Say to your master! All as much as you sent to  your servant at first, I will do;  but this thing I shall not be able to do. And [3departed 1the 2men] and returned to him the word.

10. And [3sent 4to 5him 1the son 2of Hadad] saying, Thus may [3do 4to me 1the 2gods], and thus may they add, if [4shall suffice 1the 2dust 3of Samaria] for the handful to all the people, to my footmen.

11. And [4answered 1the 2king 3of Israel] and said, Let it be enough! Let not [3boast 1the 2humpback] as the one standing straight!

12. And it came to pass when he answered to him  this word, [2was 3drinking 1he] and all the kings  with him in tents. And he said to his servants, Build a siege mound! And they put a siege mound against the city.

13. And behold, [2prophet 1one] came forward  to Ahab king of Israel, and he said, Thus says the lord, Have you seen all  [3multitude  2great 1this]? Behold, I give it today into your hands; and you shall know that I am the lord.

14. And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says the lord, By the young men of the rulers of the regions. And Ahab said, Who shall join together for the war? And he said, You.

15. And Ahab numbered the servants of the rulers of the regions, and they were two hundred thirty and two. And after these things he numbered the people, every son of power -- seven thousand.

16. And he went forth at midday. And the son of Hadad was drinking and being intoxicated in Succoth, he and the kings, thirty and two kings, the allies with him.

17. And came forth the young men, the rulers of the regions at first. And [3sent 1the son 2of Hadad], and they led up to him, saying, Men have come forth from out of Samaria.

18. And he said to them, If in peace they come forth, seize them alive! And if for war they came forth, seize them alive!

19. And [3went forth 4from 5the city 1the 2young men] of the rulers of the regions, and the force after them.

20. And [2struck 1each man] the one by him. And Syria fled, and [2pursued 3them 1Israel]. And [5escaped 1the son 2of Hadad 3king 4of Syria] upon a horse of a horseman.

21. And [4came forth 1the 2king 3of Israel], and he took the horses, and the chariots, and he struck [2calamity 1a great] against Syria.

22. And [3came forward 1the 2prophet] to the king of Israel, and he said, Strengthen yourself, and know, and see what you shall do! for returning during the year, the son of Hadad king of Syria will ascend against you.

23. And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, The God of mountains is the God of Israel, and not a God of valleys; on account of this they powered over us. But if we wage war against them according to the straight plains, assuredly we shall power over them.

24. And  this thing you do! Let [4depart 1the 2kings 3each] to  his place, and establish [2in place of 3them 1satraps]!

25. And you exchange according to the force  falling from you -- even horse for  horse, and chariots for  chariots. And we will wage war against them in the straight plains, and we will power over them. And he hearkened to  their voice, and did thus.

26. And it came to pass at the return of the year, that [3mustered 1the son 2of Hadad]  Syria, and he ascended into Aphek for war against Israel.

27. And the sons of Israel were mustered, and they came to meet them. And Israel camped right opposite them, as two flocks of goats. And Syria filled the land.

28. And came forward a man  of God, and he said to the king of Israel, Thus says the lord, Because Syria said, [4is God 5of the mountains 1the lord  2God 3of Israel], and [2is not 3God 4of the valleys 1he], that I will give  [3force  2great 1this] into [2hand 1your], and you shall know that I am the lord. 

29.  Israel Strikes Syria And these camped before those seven days. And it came to pass in the [2day  1seventh], that [3led on 1the 2war]. And Israel struck  Syria -- a hundred thousand footmen in one day.

30. And [3fled 1the 2rest] unto Aphek, into the city. And [3fell 1the 2wall] upon twenty and seven thousand men of the ones remaining. And the son of Hadad fled, and he entered into the house of the bedroom, into the inner chamber.

31. And [2said  1his servants] to him, Indeed behold we heard that the kings of the house of Israel [2kings 3of mercy 1are]. We should place indeed sackcloths upon  our loins, and rough cords upon  our heads, and we should go forth to the king of Israel; if by any means he shall bring forth alive  our lives.

32. And they girded sackcloths upon  their loins, and put rough cords upon  their heads. And they said to the king of Israel, Your servant, the son of Hadad says, Let [3live 2indeed  1my soul]! And he said, Does he still live? [2brother 1he is my].

33. And the men foretold and hastened and gathered up the word out of  his mouth, and they said, Your brother the son of Hadad. And he said, Enter, and receive him! And [3came forth 4to 5him 1the son 2of Hadad]; and they transported him upon the chariot to him.

34. And he said to him, The cities which [3took  2father 1my] from  your father, I give back to you. And [2streets 1you shall establish] in Damascus for yourself, as [2established  1my father] in Samaria. And I by covenant shall send you out. And he ordained with him a covenant, and sent him out.

35. And [2man 1one] of the sons of the prophets said to  his neighbor, by a word of the lord, Strike me indeed! And [4not 3would 1the 2man] strike him.

36. And he said to him, Because you hearkened not to the voice of the lord, behold, as you run from me,  [2shall strike 3you 1a lion]. And he went forth from him, and [2found 3him 1a lion], and struck him.

37. And he finds [2man 1another], and he said, Strike indeed me! And [3struck 4him 1the 2man], and striking he broke him.

38. And [3went 1the 2prophet] and stood to the king of Israel upon the way, and he bound [2with 3a ligature  1his eyes].

39. And it came to pass as the king came near, that he yelled out to the king. And he said,  Your servant went forth with the military  for war, and behold, a man brought to me another man, and he said to me, Guard this  man! And if by rushing away he should rush away, then [3will be required  2life 1your] for  his life, or a talent of silver you establish for it.

40. And it came to pass as  your servant looked round about here this way and here that way, that this man was not around. And [4said 5to 6him 1the 2king 3of Israel], Behold, you are the magistrate, [2for 3me 1you murdered].

41. And he hastened and removed the ligature from  his eyes. And [4recognized 5him 1the 2king 3of Israel], that [2was of 3the 4prophets 1this one].

42. And he said to him, Thus says the lord, Because you sent out [2man 1a pernicious] to escape from out of  your hand, even [2will be required  1your life] for  his life, and  your people for  his people.

43. And [4went forth 1the 2king 3of Israel] being confounded and faint, and came unto Samaria.  

## 1 Kings 21

1.  Naboth's Vineyard And it came to pass after  these words, that [3vineyard 2one 1there was] to Naboth the Jezreelite, by the house of Ahab king of Samaria.

2. And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give to me  your vineyard! and it will be to me for a garden of vegetables, for this is near  my house! And I will give to you in place of it [3vineyard 1another 2good] for it, but if not pleasing before you, I will give to you money in barter for  [2vineyard 1this your].

3. And Naboth said to Ahab, May it not be to me from the lord to give the inheritance  of my fathers to you.

4. And Ahab went to his house being in a tumult and loosened over the word which [4spoke 5to 6him 1Naboth 2the 3Jezreelite], as he said, I will not give to you the inheritance  of my fathers to you. And [4became 1the 2spirit 3of Ahab] disturbed, and he went to sleep upon  his bed, and covered up  his face, and did not eat bread.

5. And [3entered 1Jezebel  2his wife] to him, and she said to him, Why  is your spirit disturbed, and [2are not 1you] eating bread?

6. And he said to her, For I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, saying, Give to me  your vineyard for money! but if you do not want, I will give to you a vineyard in place of it. And he said, I will not give to you the inheritance  of my fathers.

7. And [3said 4to 5him 1Jezebel  2his wife], Do you now so act as king over Israel? Rise up, and eat bread, and [2yourself 1be]! and I will give to you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

8. And she wrote upon a scroll the name of Ahab, and set seal  with his seal, and sent the scroll to the elders and to the free men of the ones dwelling with Naboth.

9. And she wrote in the scroll, saying, Fast a fast, and set  Naboth at the head place of the people!

10. And set two men, sons of lawbreakers, right opposite him! And let them bear witness against him! saying, You raved against God and king. And let them lead him out and stone him, and let him die!

11. And they did (the men  of his city, the elders, and the free men  dwelling in  his city) as [2sent 3to 4them 1Jezebel], and as was written in the scrolls which she sent to them.

12. And they called a fast, and they sat  Naboth at the head of the people.

13. And [3entered 1two 2men], sons of lawbreakers, and they sat right opposite him, and bore witness against him, saying, He raved against God and king. And they led him outside the city, and they stoned him with stones, and he died.

14. And they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and died.

15. And it came to pass, as Jezebel heard the ones saying, Naboth has been stoned, and has died; Jezebel said to Ahab, Rise up, inherit the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite! for he did not give it to you for money, for [2is not 1Naboth] living, but has died.

16. And it came to pass as Ahab heard that Naboth has died, Ahab rose and went down into the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite  to inherit it.

17. And the lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

18. Rise up and go down for a meeting with Ahab king of Israel, the one in Samaria! Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, for he went down there to inherit it. 

19.  Elijah Speaks Judgment to Ahab And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus says the lord, You murdered and inherited. Therefore thus says the lord, In the place where [3licked 1the 2dogs] the blood of Naboth, there [3shall lick 1the 2dogs]  your blood.

20. And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he said, I have found you, for you sell yourself in folly  to act  wickedly before the lord,  to provoke him to anger.

21. Thus says the lord, Behold, I bring upon you evils. And I shall burn away after you, and I shall utterly destroy  of Ahab the one urinating against the wall, and the one being constrained, and the one being left in Israel.

22. And I will appoint  your house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, on account of the provocations which you provoke to anger, and led Israel into sin.

23. And  to Jezebel the lord spoke, saying, The dogs shall eat her in the area around the wall  of Jezreel.

24. The one having died  of Ahab in the city, [3will eat 1the 2dogs]; and the one having died of his in the plain, [5will eat 1the 2birds 3of the 4heaven].

25. Furthermore [2not one 1there was] as Ahab, who sold himself to do the wicked thing before the lord, as [3altered 4him 1Jezebel  2his wife].

26. And he acted [2abhorrent 1exceedingly]  to go after the abominations, according to all as many things which [3made 1the 2Amorite], whom the lord utterly destroyed from the face of the sons of Israel.

27. And it came to pass as Ahab heard  these words, he tore  his inner-garment, and he wore sackcloth upon  his body, and he fasted, and he laid in sackcloth, and he went having downcast eyes.

28. And came to pass the word of the lord to Elijah the Tishbite, and he said,

29. Have you seen that Ahab was vexed in front of me? Because he was vexed in front of me, I shall not bring the evil in  his days, but only in the days  of his son will I bring the evil upon  his house.  

## 1 Kings 22

1.  Jehoshaphat Allies with Ahab And he stayed in place three years, and there was no war between Syria and between Israel.

2. And it came to pass in the [2year  1third], that [4went down 1Jehoshaphat 2king 3of Judah] to the king of Israel.

3. And [3said  1the king 2of Israel] to  his servants, Do you know that [3is ours 1Ramoth 2Gilead], and we keep silent to not take it from out of the hand of the king of Syria?

4. And [3said  1the king 2of Israel] to Jehoshaphat, Shall you not ascend with me unto Ramoth Gilead for war?

5. And Jehoshaphat said, As you, thus also I. As  your people, thus also my people. As  your horses, so also my horses. And [4said 1Jehoshaphat 2king 3of Judah] to the king of Israel, Ask indeed today of the lord.

6. And [4gathered together 1the 2king 3of Israel] all the prophets, about four hundred men. And said to them, Shall I go unto Ramoth Gilead for war, or wait? And they said, Ascend! for by giving, the lord shall give into the hands of the king.

7. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Is there not here a prophet of the lord, and we shall ask the lord through him?

8. And [4said 1the 2king 3of Israel] to Jehoshaphat, Yet there is one man for the asking the lord through him, and I detest him, for he does not speak concerning me for good things, but only bad -- Micaiah son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not [3speak 1the 2king] so.

9. And [4called 1the 2king 3of Israel 6eunuch 5one], and he said,  Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.

13. And the messenger, the one going to call  Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, indeed all the prophets speak [2mouth 1by one] good things concerning the king. Let it be indeed that you be with words according to the words of one of these, and speak good!

14. And Micaiah said, As the lord lives, that what ever the lord should say to me, these things I shall speak.

15. And he came to the king. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], Micaiah, Shall I ascend to Ramoth Gilead for war, or wait? And he said to him, Ascend! and the lord shall prosper the way in the hand of the king.

16. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], How often shall I adjure you that you should speak to me the truth in the name of the lord? 

17.  Micaiah Prophesies Defeat And Micaiah said thus, I see all  Israel being scattered in the mountains as sheep in which there is no shepherd. And the lord said, There is no lord to these, let [2return 1each] to  his house in peace!

18. And [4said 1the 2king 3of Israel] to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Did I not say to you that [2would not 3prophesy 1this one 5unto me 4good things], but only bad?

19. And Micaiah said, On account of this hear the word of the lord! I saw the lord God of Israel sitting upon his throne, and all the military of the heaven standing about him at his right, and at his left.

20. And the lord said, Who shall deceive  Ahab king of Israel, that he shall ascend in Ramoth Gilead and shall fall there? And this one said thus, and this other one thus.

21. And [2came forth 1a spirit], and stood before the lord. And he said, I will deceive him.

22. And [2said 3to 4him 1the lord], In what way? And he said, I shall go forth, and I shall be [2spirit 1a lying] in the mouth of all  his prophets. And he said, You shall deceive, and indeed you will be able. Go forth, and do so!

23. And now, behold, the lord has put [2spirit 1a lying] in the mouth of all  [2your prophets 1these], and the lord spoke against you bad things.

24. And [4came forward 1Zedekiah 2son 3of Chenaanah], and he struck  Micaiah upon the jaw, and he said, What kind of spirit of the lord departed from me  to speak with you?

25. And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see in  that day, whenever you shall enter an inner chamber of the storeroom  to hide. 

26.  Micaiah Put under Guard And [4said 1the 2king 3of Israel], Take  Micaiah, and return him to Amon the ruler of the city, and to Joash son of the king!

27. And say, Thus says the king, Put him in prison, and let him eat bread of affliction and water of affliction until  my return in peace!

28. And Micaiah said, If in returning, you should return in peace, [2did not 3speak 1the lord] by me. And he said, Let [4hearken 1all 2the 3people]!

29. And [4ascended up 1the 2king 3of Israel], and Jehoshaphat king of Judah with him unto Ramoth Gilead.

30. And [4said 1the 2king 3of Israel] to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I shall cover up myself, and enter into the battle; and you put on  my clothes! And [4covered himself up 1the 2king 3of Israel], and he entered into the battle.

31. And the king of Syria gave charge to the rulers  of his chariots -- thirty and two, saying, Do not do battle against the small or great, but the king of Israel alone.

33. And it happened as [5saw 1the 2rulers 3of the 4chariots] that [2is not 3the king 4of Israel 1this], that they turned away from him. 

34.  Ahab Dies in Battle And [3stretched tight 1one 4the 5bow 2merely], and it struck the king of Israel between the lungs and between the chest plate. And he said to his charioteer, Turn  your hand and lead me out of the battle! for I have been wounded.

35. And [3turned 1the 2war] in  that day. And the king was set upon the chariot right opposite Syria, from morning until evening. And [3poured out 1the 2blood] from the wound into the cavity of the chariot.

36. And [3stood 1the 2herald of the army] in the camp until the going down of the sun, saying, Each to  his own city, and each to  his own land,

37. for [3has died 1the 2king]. And they went unto Samaria, and they entombed the king in Samaria.

38. And they washed the blood from the chariot at the fountain of Samaria. And [3licked up 1the 2dogs] the blood, and the harlots bathed in the blood, according to the saying of the lord which he spoke.

39. And the rest of the words of Ahab, and all which he did, and the house of ivory which he built, and all the cities which he made, [3not 1behold 5these 2have] been written in the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?

44. And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

45. And the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, and  his dominions which he had, [4not 1behold 3these 2are] written in the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

46. And the rest of the ones being initiated of the things being forsaken in the days of Asa  his father he removed from the land.

47. And a king was not established in Edom.

48. And Jehoshaphat prepared ships of Tarshish  to go unto Ophir because of  gold. And they did not go; for [3were destroyed 1the 2ships] in Ezion Geber.
