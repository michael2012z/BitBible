## Ezekiel 1

1.  Ezekiel's Vision of the Living Creatures And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, the fifth of the month, and I was in the midst of the captivity by the river  Chebar, and [3were opened 1the 2heavens], and I beheld visions of God.

2. On the fifth of the month, this is the [2year  1fifth] of the captivity  of king Jehoiakim,

3. and [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river  Chebar; and [3came 4upon 5me 1the hand 2of the lord].

4. And I beheld, and behold, a wind lifting up came from the north, and [2cloud 1a great] with it, and brightness round about it, and fire flashing. And in the midst of it was as the vision of molten bronze in the midst of the fire, and brightness in it.

5. And in the midst was as a likeness of four living creatures. And this is their vision -- a likeness of a man was unto them.

6. And there were four faces to the one, and four wings to the one.

7. And  their legs were straight; and [2feathered  1their feet]; and there were sparks as flashing brass; and [2were light  1their wings].

8. And the hand of a man was beneath  their wings, upon  [2four 3parts 1their]. And  their faces and  their wings, of the four, were being next to the other of the other.

9. And  their wings were not turned in  their proceeding; each [2opposite  3their face 1went].

10. And the likeness  of their faces was as the face of a man, and a face of a lion from out of the right to the four; and the face of a calf from out of the left to the four; and the face of an eagle to the four.

11. And  their wings were stretching out above; to the four each, two being yoked together to one another, and two covered up upon  their body.

12. And each to the other [2in front 3of him 1went]. Where ever [3was 1the 2spirit] going, they went, and they did not turn.

13. And in the midst of the living creatures was a vision as of coals of fire burning, as the appearance of lamps twisting in the midst of the living creatures. And brightness was of the fire, and from out of the fire went forth as lightning. 

14.  The Wheels And the living creatures were running and returning as the appearance of the lightning.

15. And I beheld, and behold, there was [2wheel 1one] upon the earth being next to the living creatures, next to the four.

16. And the sight of the wheels and their action was as the sight of Tharsis stone. And there was [2likeness 1one] to the four; and  their work was as if it may be a wheel in a wheel.

17. Upon  [2four 3parts 1their] they went; they did not turn in  their going,

18. and yet  their backs and height was to them. And I beheld them, and  their backs full of eyes, round about to the four.

19. And in the going, the living creatures went, the wheels being next to them. And in the lifting away [4the 5living creatures 6from 7the 8earth 3lifted away 1the 2wheels].

20. Where ever [3was 1the 2cloud] there the spirit  was to go; [3went 1the 2living creatures], and the wheels also lifted away with them; because spirit of life was in the wheels.

21. In  their going, the wheels went; and in  their standing, the wheels stood; and in  their lifting away from the earth, the wheels lifted away with them; for spirit of life was in the wheels.

22. And the likeness above the head of the living creatures was as a firmament, as the vision of ice being stretched out over  their wings on top.

23. And under the firmament  their wings were stretching out flapping, the other to the other; to each two covering  their bodies.

24. And I heard the sound  of their wings in  their going, as the sound [2water 1of much], as the sound of a worthy one in  their going; a sound of the word as a sound of a camp; and in  their standing [3rested  1their wings]. 

25.  The Vision of the Throne And behold, a sound far above the firmament,

26. of the one being above their head, as a vision of stone of sapphire with a likeness of a throne upon it; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as a form of a man from above.

27. And I beheld as an appearance of molten bronze, as a vision of fire within it round about from the vision of the loin and up; and from the vision of the loin unto below I beheld as a vision as of fire, and  its brightness round about.

28. As the vision of a bow whenever it might be in the cloud in a day of rain, thus was the position of the brightness round about. This is the vision of the likeness of the glory of the lord. And I beheld, and I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice speaking.  

## Ezekiel 2

1.  Ezekiel is Commissioned Prophet to Israel And he said to me, O son of man, stand upon  your feet, and I shall speak to you!

2. And came upon me a spirit. And it took me up, and lifted me away, and stood me upon my feet. And I heard him speaking to me.

3. And he said to me, O son of man, I shall send you to the sons  of Israel, of the ones rebelling against me; the ones who rebelled against me. They and  their fathers disregarded  me, until  today's day.

4. And [4sons 1harsh 2and 3hard-hearted] -- I shall send you to them. And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord the lord.

5. If it is so that they should hearken or be terrified, for [2house 1it is a rebellious], yet shall they know that [2a prophet 1you are] in the midst of them.

6. And you, O son of man, should not be afraid of them, nor be startled by their face, for they shall be heated, and shall rise up together against you round about. And [3in 4the midst 5of scorpions 1you 2dwell].  [3their words 1You should not 2fear], and before their face you should not be startled, for [2house 1it is a rebellious].

7. And you shall speak  my words to them, for surely they shall hear or be terrified; for [3house 2a rebellious 1it is].

8. And you, O son of man, hearken to the one speaking to you! Be not rebellious as the [2house  1rebellious]! Gape wide  your mouth, and eat what I give to you!

9. And I beheld, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and in it a roll of a scroll.

10. And he unrolled it in my presence, and was in it things being written on the front and the rear; and it had written on it a lamentation, and a strain, and a woe.  

## Ezekiel 3

1.  Ezekiel Eats the Roll And he said to me, O son of man, eat what ever you should find! Eat  this roll, and go and speak to the sons of Israel!

2. And he opened wide  my mouth, and fed me  this roll.

3. And he said to me, O son of man,  your mouth shall eat, and  your belly shall be filled of this roll, of the one being given to you. And I ate it, and it became in  my mouth as [2honey 1sweet].

4. And he said to me, O son of man, proceed and enter to the house  of Israel, and speak  my words to them!

5. For not as to a people of thick lips and speaking an unknown language are you sent to the house  of Israel;

6. nor to [2peoples 1many] of foreign languages, or foreign tongues, nor [2dense  3in tongue 1being], whose [2you hear not  1words]. But if to such I sent you, these would have listened to you.

7. But the house  of Israel in no way shall want to listen to you; for they do not consent to listen to me. For all the house of Israel is contentious and hard-hearted.

8. And behold, I have imputed  your face mighty against  their faces; and  your victory shall prevail against  their victory.

9. And it shall be always more strong than a rock. You should not fear from them, nor should you be terrified before their face; for [3house 2a rebellious 1it is].

10. And he said to me, O son of man, all the words which I have spoken with you, take into  your heart, and [2with 3your ears 1hearken]!

11. And proceed, enter unto the captivity, to the sons  of your people! And you shall speak to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord, the lord; Surely they shall hear, surely they shall give way.

12. And [2took me up 1spirit], and I heard from behind me a sound [2quake 1of a great], saying, Blessed be the glory of the lord from out of  his place.

13. And I heard a sound of the wings of the living creatures flapping one to the other; and the sound of the wheels next to them, and the sound of the [2quake 1great].

14. And the spirit lifted me away, and took me; and I went elevated by impulse  of my spirit; and the hand of the lord came [2upon 3me 1fortified].

15. And I entered to the captivity elevated; and I went around the ones dwelling by the river  Chebar, the ones being there; and I stayed there seven days, behaving in the midst of them. 

16.  Ezekiel Appointed As Watchman And it came to pass after the seven days, and [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

17. O son of man, [3watchman 1I have appointed 2you] to the house of Israel, and you shall hear [2from out of 3my mouth 1the word]; and you shall threaten them by me.

18. In  my saying to the lawless one, To death you shall be put to death; and you do not give orders to him, nor spoke  to give orders to the lawless one,  to turn from  [3ways 1his 2unjust], so that he should live;  that lawless one  [2in his iniquity 1shall die], and  his blood [2from out of 3your hand 1I shall require].

19. And if you should give orders to the lawless one, and he should not turn from  his lawlessness, nor  [3way 1his 2unjust];  that lawless one [2in  3his iniquity 1shall die], and you  [2your soul 1shall rescue].

20. And in the turning of a just man from  his righteousness, and he should commit a transgression, and I give  torment to his face, and he dies, but you did not give orders to him; then in  his sins he dies, for in no way [2be remembered  1shall his righteousness] which he did, and  his blood [2from out of  3your hand 1I shall require].

21. [3you 1But 2if] give orders to the just man to not sin, and he should not sin, the just man [2to life 1shall live], for you warned him, and you  [2your own 3soul 1shall have rescued].

22. And [3came to pass 4there 5upon 6me 1the hand 2of the lord]. And he said to me, Rise up, and go forth into the plain! and there it shall be spoken to you.

23. And I rose up and went forth to the plain. And behold, there the glory of the lord stood as the glory which I beheld by the river  Chebar. And I fell upon my face.

24. And [2came 3upon 4me 1spirit], and stood me upon  my feet, and spoke to me, and said to me, Enter and be locked up in the midst  of your house! 

25.  Bonds Appointed to Ezekiel And you, O son of man, behold, [2were appointed 3for 4you 1bonds], and they shall tie you with them, and in no way shall you come forth from the midst of them.

26. And  [2your tongue 1I shall tie] to your throat, and you shall become mute, and you will not be to them for a man reproving; for [3house 2a rebellious 1it is].

27. And in  my speaking to you, I shall open  your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord the lord; The one hearing, let him hear! and the one resisting persuasion, let him resist persuasion! for [3house 2a rebellious 1it is]!  

## Ezekiel 4

1.  The Sign of the Brick and Frying Pan And you, O son of man, take unto yourself a brick! and you shall put it before your face,; and you shall diagram upon it the city  of Jerusalem.

2. And you shall put [2against 3it 1an encompassment about]; and you shall build [2against 3it 1battlements]; and you shall put around upon it a siege mound; and you shall put [2upon 3it 1camps], and shall order the range of weapons round about.

3. And you, take to yourself a frying pan of iron! And you shall make it a wall of iron between you and between the city. And you shall prepare  your face against it, and it will be for a siege, and you shall besiege it. [2is a sign 1This] to the sons of Israel. 

4.  The Siege of Jerusalem Portrayed And you shall go to sleep upon  [3side 1your  2left], and you shall put the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days which you shall sleep upon it. And you shall take  their iniquities.

5. And I have appointed to you the two things for their iniquities for a number of days -- ninety and three hundred days; and you shall take the iniquities of the house of Israel.

6. And you shall complete these, and then go to sleep upon  [3side 1your  2right], and you shall take the iniquities of the house of Judah -- forty days; a day for a year is established to you.

7. And for the siege of Jerusalem you shall prepare  your face, and  [2your arm 1you shall stiffen], and you shall prophesy against it.

8. And I, behold, I have appointed for you bonds, and you shall not be turned from  your one side unto  your other side, until of which time [4should be completed 1the 2days  3of your siege]. 

9.  The Famine Portrayed And you, take to yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and wild oats! And put them into [3container 1one 2earthenware], and make them [3for yourself 1into 2bread loaves]! And according to the number of the days which you slept upon  your side -- ninety and three hundred days -- you shall eat them.

10. And  your food which you shall eat by weight is twenty shekels  a day; from time to time you shall eat them.

11. And [2water 3by 4measure 1you shall drink]; the sixth of the hin [2from 3time 4to 5time 1you shall drink].

12. And a cake baked in hot ashes of barley -- you shall eat them baked in dung, [3of the dung 4of a human 1you shall hide 2them in the coals] before their eyes.

13. Thus says the lord  God  of Israel; So shall [4eat 1the 2sons 3of Israel] unclean among the nations  which I cast them.

14. And I said, By no means, O lord  God  of Israel, since  my soul has not been defiled in uncleanness; and [3decaying flesh 4and 5that taken by wild beasts 1I have not 2eaten] from my birth until the present; nor has [4entered 5into  6my mouth 1any 3meat 2profane].

15. And he said to me, Behold, I give to you dung of oxen instead of the dung  of humans, and you shall make  bread loaves upon them.

16. And he said to me, O son of man, behold, I shall break the reliance of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and in lack; and [2water 3by 4measure 5and 6unto 7extinction 1they shall drink];

17. so that [2lacking 1they should be] of bread and water; and [4shall be obliterated 1a man 2and 3his brother]; and they shall melt away in  their iniquities.  

## Ezekiel 5

1.  The Siege Portrayed And you, O son of man, take to yourself [2broadsword 1a sharp] for a razor of a barber! You shall acquire it to yourself, and you shall bring it upon  your head, and upon  your beard. And you shall take a yoke balance scale of weights, and you shall part them.

2.  A fourth part [2in 3fire 1you shall kindle] in the middle of the city, according to the fullness of the days of the siege. And you shall take  a fourth part and shall incinerate it in the midst of it. and  a fourth part you shall cut in pieces with the broadsword round about it. And  a fourth part you shall disperse to the wind; for [2a sword 1I shall empty out] after them.

3. And you shall take from there a few in number, and shall wrap them in your wrapping.

4. And from out of these you shall take still more, and shall toss them into the midst of the fire, and shall incinerate them by fire; [3from 4it 2shall come forth 1and fire], and you shall say to all the house of Israel,

5. Thus says Adonai the lord; This  is Jerusalem; [3in 4the midst 5of the 6nations 1I have placed 2her], and the ones round about her place.

6. And you shall tell  of my ordinances to the lawless one of the nations, and  my laws to the lawless of the places  round about her; because  [2my ordinances 1they thrust away], and in  my laws they did not go by them.

7. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Because  your opportunity for lawlessness is from the nations  round about you, and in  my laws you did not go, and  my ordinances you did not observe, but not even according to the ordinances of the nations  round about you  did you observe;

8. on account of this, Thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I am against you, and I shall execute [2in 3the midst 4of you 1judgment] before the nations.

9. And I shall do among you what I have not done, and I shall not do likened to them again against all  your abominations.

10. On account of this, fathers shall eat the children in your midst, and children shall eat fathers. And I shall execute [2among 3you 1judgments]; and I shall scatter all the rest of you unto every wind.

11. On account of this, as I live, says Adonai the lord; Assuredly, because  [2my holy things 1you defiled] in all  your loathsome things, and in all  your abominations, I also thrust you away; [3will not 4spare 1my  2eye], and I shall not show mercy. 

12.  Famine, Plague, Dispersion and the Sword The fourth part of you [2by 3plague 1shall be consumed]; and  a fourth part of you [2by 3famine 1shall be finished off] in your midst; and  a fourth part of you [2unto 3every 4wind 1will be dispersed]; and  a fourth part of you [2by 3the broadsword 1shall fall] round about you; and a sword I shall empty out after them.

13. And [2shall be exhausted  1my rage], and  my anger against them. And I shall enjoin, and you shall know, because I the lord have spoken in  my zeal in  my exhausting  my anger against them.

14. And I shall make you into a wilderness, even  your daughters round about you, in the presence of all traveling through.

15. And you will be bemoaned and wretched among the nations round about you, in  my executing among you judgments in anger and in rage, and in vengeance of rage. I the lord have spoken.

16. In  my sending the arrows  of famine upon them, then they will be in want, and I shall send them to ruin you. And [2famine 1I shall gather] unto you, and I shall break the reliance of your bread.

17. And I shall send out against you famine and [2wild beasts 1ferocious], and I shall punish you; and plague and blood shall go through upon you; and a sword I shall bring upon you. I the lord have spoken.  

## Ezekiel 6

1.  Against the Mountains of Israel And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, fix  your face upon the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them!

3. And you shall say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of Adonai the lord! Thus says Adonai the lord to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the ravines, and to the groves; Behold, I bring upon you a broadsword, and [2will be utterly destroyed  1your high places].

4. And [4will be broken down  1your altars 2and  3your sacred precincts]. And I will throw down your slain before  your idols. And I shall offer the corpses of the sons of Israel in front  of their idols.

5. And I shall scatter  your bones round about  your altars.

6. In all  your house the cities shall be made quite desolate, and the high places shall be obliterated, so that [2shall be utterly destroyed  1your altars], and [2shall be broken 3and 4caused to cease  1your idols], and [2shall be lifted away  1your sacred precincts], and [2shall be wiped away  1your works].

7. And [2shall fall 1slain ones] in your midst, and you shall realize that I am the lord.

8. And I shall leave behind some in the taking place of your ones escaping from the broadsword among the nations, and in  your being dispersed in the places.

9. And [5shall remember 6me 1the ones 2escaping 3of 4yours] among the nations of which they were taken captive there. I have sworn against their heart, against the one fornicating from me; and with their eyes  fornicating after  their practices. And they shall smite against their faces for the evils which they did in all  their abominations.

10. And they shall realize that I the lord [2not 8for 9nothing 1have 3spoken  4to do 7against them 5all  6these evils].

11. Thus says the lord; Clap with the hand, and stamp with the foot, and say, Well done, over all the abominations of the house of Israel! By the broadsword, and by plague, and by famine they shall fall.

12. The one far away [2by 3plague 1shall come to an end]. And the one near [2by 3the broadsword 1shall fall]. And the one being left behind, and the one being compassed by siege [2by 3famine 1will be finished off]. And I shall exhaust  my anger against them.

13. And you shall know that I am the lord in  [2being  1your slain] in the midst  of your idols, round about  your altars, upon every [2hill 1high], and on all the tops of the mountains, and underneath [2tree 1every shady],  underneath every [2oak 1bushy], of which they offered there a scent of pleasant aroma to all  their idols.

14. And I shall stretch out  my hand against them, and I shall make the land for extinction; even [5for 6ruin 1from 2the 3wilderness 4of Diblath] of all  their habitation. And you shall realize that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 7

1.  The End Has Come And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. And you, O son of man, thus says Adonai the lord to the land  of Israel; End is come; the end is come upon the four wings of the land.

3. [3is come 1The 2end] now; the end to you. And I shall send  my rage. I am against you, and I shall punish you in  your ways, and I shall impute against you all  your abominations.

4. [2will not 3spare  1My eye] over you, nor shall I show mercy. For  [2your way 3against you 1I shall impute], and  your abominations [2in 3the midst 4of you 1will be]. And you shall know that I am the lord.

5. For thus says Adonai the lord; An evil, one evil; Behold, it is at hand.

6. The end is come, [3is come 1the 2end] awakened against you. 

7.  Punishment Meted Out to Israel Behold, [2is come 1the wreathen circle] upon you, the one dwelling the land. [3is come 1The 2time], [3has approached 1the 2day], not with tumult nor with pangs.

8. Now nearly I will pour out  my anger upon you, and I will complete  my rage against you, and I will judge you in  your ways, and I will impute against you all  your abominations.

9. [2shall not 3spare  1My eye], nor shall I show mercy. According to  your ways [2against 3you 1I will impute], and  your abominations [2in 3your midst 1will be]. And you shall realize that I am the lord, the one striking.

10. Behold, the day of the lord is come, the rod has bloomed.

11. The insolence has risen up, and it will break the reliance of the lawless one, and not with a tumult nor with anxiety.

12. [3is come 1The 2time]; behold, the day. [2the one 3acquiring things 1Let not] rejoice! and [2the one 3selling things 1let not] wail! for wrath for all the magnitude of it.

13. For the one acquiring [2to 3the 4thing selling 1shall not return]; and still in the life  of their living, that the vision is for all  their multitude -- it shall not return, and a man in the eyes [2his life 1shall not hold].

14. Trump with the trumpet, and judge  all things! But there is not one going to the war, for  my wrath is upon all  her multitude.

15. The broadsword from outside, and the famine and  plague from inside. The one in the plain [2by 3a broadsword 1shall come to an end], and the ones in the city [2by famine 3and 4plague 1shall end].

16. And [5shall be escaped 1the ones 2escaping 3of 4them], and they will be upon the mountains as a pigeon meditating. And [2all 1I will kill], each in  his iniquities.

17. All hands shall be enfeebled, and all thighs shall be tainted in wetness.

18. And they shall gird on sackcloths, and [2shall cover 3them 1stupefaction]. And upon every face shame will be upon them, and upon every head baldness.

19.  Their silver shall be tossed in the squares, and  their gold shall be spurned.  Their silver and  their gold  shall not be able to rescue them in a day of wrath of the lord.  Their souls in no way shall be satisfied, and  their bellies shall not be filled; because the torment  for their iniquities took place.

20. A choice ornament for pride -- they made them; and images  of their abominations they made from them. Because of this I have given them to them for uncleanness.

21. And I will deliver them into the hands of strangers  to tear them in pieces; and to the pestilent ones of the earth for spoils. And they shall profane them.

22. And I will turn  my face from them, and they shall defile  my overseeing, and they shall enter to them unguardedly, and profane them.

23. And they shall produce befouling, because the land is full of judgments of blood, and the city full of lawlessness. And I will bring evils of nations, and they shall inherit  their houses.

24. And I will turn the neighing  of their strength; and [2shall be defiled  1their holy things].

25. Making an atonement shall come, and one shall seek peace, and it will not be. 

26.  Woes upon Priest, Prophet and Elders Woe upon woe will be, and message upon message will be; and [2shall be sought 1a vision] from a prophet, and the law shall be lost of the priest, and counsel from the elders; the king shall mourn,

27. and the ruler shall put on extinction, and the hands of the people of the land shall be disabled. According to  their ways I will do to them, and in  their judgments I will punish them; and they shall know that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 8

1.  Idolatry in the Temple And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, the fifth of the month, I was sitting in  my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting down before me. And came upon me the hand of Adonai the lord.

2. And I beheld, and behold, a likeness of a man; from  his loin, and unto below as fire; and from  his loin and above him as the vision of brightness, as an appearance  of molten bronze.

3. And he stretched out a likeness of a hand, and he took me up by the decorative hem  of my top. And [2took 3me 1spirit] in between the earth and between the heaven, and led me unto Jerusalem in a vision of God, unto the thresholds of the [2gate  1inner]  looking to the north of which was the monument of the acquirer. 

4.  The Glory of The LORD Appears And behold, [5was 6there 1glory 2of the lord 3God 4of Israel], according to the vision which I beheld in the plain.

5. And he said to me, O son of man, look up with your eyes towards the north. And I looked up  with my eyes towards the north. And behold, from the north at the gate, the one towards the east of the altar, was the image  of jealousy; this was in the entering it.

6. And he said to me, O son of man, do you see what these do? [2lawless deeds 1the great] which the house of Israel does here  to keep at a distance from  my holy places? And still you shall see [2lawless deeds 1greater].

7. And he brought me unto the thresholds of the courtyard. And I saw, and behold, [2opening 1one] in the wall.

8. And he said to me, O son of man, dig in the wall! And I dug in the wall. And behold, a door.

9. And he said to me, Enter, and see the [2lawless deeds  1evil] which these do here!

10. And I entered and I saw. And behold, every likeness of a crawling thing and a beast, vain abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, being diagramed upon the wall round about wholly.

11. And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing before their face; and each  [2his incense pan 1had] in the hand; and the vapor of the incense ascended.

12. And he said to me, You have seen, O son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in darkness, each of them in  [3room  2hidden 1their]; because they said, [3does not 4see 1the 2 lord]; the lord has abandoned the earth.

13. And he said to me, Still you will see [2lawless deeds 1greater] which these do.

14. And he brought me unto the thresholds of the gate of the house of the lord, of the one looking to the north. And behold, there women were sitting down wailing  Tammuz.

15. And he said to me, You have seen, O son of man, and still you shall see [2practices 1greater] than these. 

16.  Ezekiel Brought unto the Courtyard And he brought me into the courtyard of the house of the lord, the inner courtyard. And upon the thresholds of the temple of the lord between the columned porch and between the altar were about twenty and five men  with their posteriors towards the temple of the lord, and  their faces before the east. And these did obeisance according to the east to the sun.

17. And he said to me, You have seen, O son of man, is it a small thing to the house of Judah  to commit the lawless deeds which they have done here? For they filled the land of lawlessness, and returned  to provoke me to anger. And behold, these stretch out the vine branch as ones sneering.

18. And I shall deal with them with rage. [2shall not 3spare  1My eye], nor shall I show mercy, and should they call in  my ears [2voice 1with a great], even I will not listen to them.  

## Ezekiel 9

1.  Jerusalem's Punishment And he shouted aloud into  my ears [2voice 1with a great], saying, [5has approached 1The 2punishment 3of the 4city]. And each had the items for the devastation in  his hand.

2. And behold, there were six men coming from the way of the [2gate  1high], of the one looking to the north. And each had a hewing axe for devastation in  his hand; and one man in the midst of them was clothed in a foot length robe, and there was a belt of sapphire upon  his loin. And they entered and stood next to the altar  of brass.

3. And the glory of the God  of Israel ascended from the cherubim, (the glory being upon them,) into the open air of the house. And he called the man  being clothed with the foot length robe, who had [3upon  4his loin 1the 2belt].

4. And the lord said to him, Go through the midst of the city, and the midst  of Jerusalem, and put the sign upon the foreheads of the men! of the ones groaning, and of the ones being grievously afflicted over all the lawless deeds, the ones taking place in the midst of them.

5. And he said to these in my hearing, Go into the city behind him and smite! And you should not spare  your eyes, and you should not show mercy. 

6.  The Killing Begins at the Sanctuary An older man, and a young man, and a virgin, and infants, and women -- kill unto wiping out! But upon all upon whom there is the sign, you should not approach. And [2from  3my holy places 1begin]! And they began with the men of the elders who were inside in the house.

7. And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the ways of the dead, and [2the ones going forth 1smite]!

8. And it came to pass in  their smiting, that I fell upon my face, and I yelled out, and said, Alas, Adonai, O lord, do you wipe away the remnant  of Israel in the pouring out  of your rage upon Jerusalem?

9. And he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah has been magnified very exceedingly. For [3was filled 1the 2land 5peoples 4of many], and the city was filled with iniquity and uncleanness. For they say, The lord has abandoned the earth, [2does not 3inspect it  1the lord].

10. And [2shall not 3spare  1my eye], nor shall I show mercy.  [2their ways 3against 4their heads 1I have imputed].

11. And behold, the man, the one being clothed with the foot length robe, and having [3tied around 1the 2belt]  his loin, even answered saying, I have done as you gave charge to me.  

## Ezekiel 10

1.  The Likeness of a Throne And I beheld, and behold, upon the firmament  above the head of the cherubim was [4stone 3of sapphire 1a likeness 2of a throne] over them.

2. And he said to the man  clothed by the robe, Enter into the midst of the wheels, of the ones underneath the cherubim, and fill  your hands full of coals of fire from out of the midst of the cherubim, and scatter them upon the city! And he entered before me.

3. And the cherubim stood at the right of the house, in the entering of the man. And the cloud filled the [2courtyard  1inner]. 

4.  The Glory Departs from the Temple And [4departed 1the 2glory 3of the lord] from the cherubim into the open air of the house. And [3was filled 1the 2house] with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled of the brightness of the glory of the lord.

5. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard unto  [3courtyard 1the 2outer], as the sound of God Saddai speaking.

6. And it came to pass in  his giving charge to the man, to the one being clothed in the [2robe  1holy], saying, Take fire from out of the midst of the wheels, from the place between the cherubim! And he entered and stood next to the wheels.

7. And [3stretched out 1the 2cherub]  his hand into the midst of the fire, of the one being in the midst of the cherubim. And he took, and put it unto the hands of the one being clothed by the [2robe  1holy]. And he took it and came forth.

8. And I beheld the cherubim having likenesses of the hands of men from beneath  their wings.

9. And I beheld, and behold, four wheels stood next to the cherubim, [2wheel 1one] being next to [2cherub 1one], and [2wheel 1one] being next to [2cherub 1one]. And the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance [2stone 1of carbuncle].

10. And their appearance was as the likeness one to the four, in which manner whenever [2might be 1a wheel] in the midst of a wheel.

11. In  their going [2in  4four 5parts 3their 1they went]; they did not turn in  their going. For unto which ever place [4looked 1the 3head  2one] behind it they went, and they did not turn in  their going.

12. And all  their flesh, and  their backs, and  their hands, and  their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes round about to the four wheels of them.

13.  And these wheels were called Gelgel in my hearing.

14. And there were four faces to the one; the face of the one was the face of the cherub. And the [3face 1the 2second] was a face of a man; and the third face a lion; and the fourth face an eagle. 

15.  The Cherubim Depart And [3departed 1the 2cherubim]. This is the living creature which I saw by the river  Chebar.

16. And in the [2going  1cherubim], [3went 1the 2wheels], and these were next to them. And in the lifting away of the cherubim,  of their wings  to raise up on high from the earth, [2did not 3turn  1their wheels]; and indeed they were by the ones next to them.

17. In  their standing, their wheels stood; and in  their rising up on high, the wheels rose up on high with them; because spirit of life was in them.

18. And [3went forth 1the glory 2of the lord] from the open air of the house, and mounted upon the cherubim.

19. And [3lifted up 1the 2cherubim]  their wings, and rose up on high from the earth before me, in  their going forth, and the wheels were next to them. And they stood upon the thresholds of the gate of the house of the lord, of the one before. And the glory of the God of Israel was upon them up above.

20. This [2the 3living creature 1is] which I saw underneath the God of Israel by the river  Chebar; and I knew that they are cherubim.

21. Four faces to the one, and four wings to the one; and having a likeness of hands of men from beneath  their wings,

22. and the likeness  of their faces -- these [2the 3faces 1are] which I saw underneath the glory of the God of Israel by the river  Chebar, in the vision of them. And these -- each of them [2according to 3their face 1went].  

## Ezekiel 11

1.  Judgment on Jerusalem's Leaders And [2took me up 1spirit], and led me unto the gate of the house of the lord, the one over against the one looking according to the east. And behold, upon the threshold of the gate were about twenty and five men. And I saw in the midst of them  Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the ones guiding the people.

2. And he said to me, O son of man, these are the men  considering vain things, and deliberating [2counsel 1evil] in  this city.

3. The ones saying, Have they not recently built the houses? This is the kettle, and we are the meats.

4. On account of this, prophesy against them! Prophesy, O son of man! 

5.  Ezekiel Prophesies against Israel And there fell upon me spirit of the lord. And he said to me, You say! Thus says the lord; As you said, O house of Israel, and the deliberations  of your spirit I know.

6. You multiplied your dead in  this city, and you filled up  her ways of slain ones.

7. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord;  Your dead whom you struck in the midst of her, these are the meats, and she is the kettle. And you I will lead out from the midst of her.

8. [2the broadsword 1You fear], and the broadsword I will bring upon you, says Adonai the lord.

9. And I will lead you from the midst of her. And I will deliver you into the hands of strangers. And I will execute [2among 3you 1judgments].

10. By the broadsword you shall fall. Upon the borders  of Israel I will judge you, and you will realize that I am the lord.

11. She [2to you 1shall not be] for a kettle, and you in no way shall become in the midst of her for meat.

12. Unto the borders  of Israel I will judge you, and you shall know, for I am the lord. For [2in  3my commandments 1you did not go], and  of my judgments you went not, and according to the judgments of the nations, of the ones around you, you went.

13. And it came to pass in  my prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. And I fell upon my face, and I yelled out [2voice 1with a great], and said, Alas, Adonai O lord, unto consummation do you appoint the remnant  of Israel?

14. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

15. O son of man,  your brethren, and the men  of your captivity, and all the house  of Israel have come to completion, about whom [4said 5to them 1the ones 2dwelling 3in Jerusalem], You are far at a distance from the lord; [4to us 3has been given 1the 2land] for an inheritance.

16. On account of this, you say! Thus says Adonai the lord, that, I will thrust them into the nations, and I will disperse them into every land, and I will be to them for [2sanctuary 1a small] in the places where ever they shall enter into there.

17. On account of this, you say! Thus says Adonai the lord, that, I will take them from out of the nations, and I will gather them from out of the places of which I scattered them among them, and I will give to them the land  of Israel.

18. And they shall enter there, and they shall lift away all  her abominations, and all  her lawless deeds from out of her. 

19.  Future Restoration Promised And I will give to them [2heart 1another], and [3spirit 2a new 1I will put] in them; and I will pull out the [2heart  1stone] from  their flesh, and I will give to them a heart of flesh;

20. so that [2by  3my orders 1they shall go], and  [2my ordinances 1they shall guard], and they shall execute them. And they will be to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.

21. And for the heart  of their abominations, and  of their lawlessnesses, as  their heart went,  [2their ways 3against 4their heads 1I have imputed], says Adonai the lord.

22. And [3lifted up 1the 2cherubim]  their wings, and the wheels were next to them, and the glory of the God of Israel was upon them, up above them.

23. And [4ascended 1the 2glory 3of the lord] from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which was before the city.

24. And spirit took me up, and led me into the land of the Chaldeans, unto the captivity, in a vision by spirit of God. And I ascended from the vision which I beheld.

25. And I spoke to the captivity all the words of the lord which he showed to me.  

## Ezekiel 12

1.  Captivity Portrayed And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, [3in 4the midst  5of their iniquities 1you 2dwell], the ones who have eyes  to see, and do not see; and [2ears 1have]  to hear, and do not hear. For [3house 2a rebelling 1it is].

3. And you, O son of man, prepare for yourself items of captivity, and be as captured by day in their presence! And you shall be as captured from out of  your place into another place before them, so that they should see, for [3house 2a rebelling 1it is].

4. And you shall bring forth  your items, items [2of captivity 1for a day] before their eyes. And you shall go forth at evening before them as [2goes forth 1a captive] before them.

5. Dig for yourself into the wall! and you shall go completely through it.

6. [2before 3them 4upon 5a shoulder 1You shall be taken up], and [2being hidden 1you shall go forth].  [2your face 1You shall cover up], and in no way should you behold the ground. Because [3as a portent 1I have put 2you] to the house of Israel.

7. And I did so according to all as much as he gave charge to me. And I brought forth items [2of captivity 1for the day], and at evening I dug through [3myself 1the 2wall] by hand; and being hidden I came forth; [2upon 3a shoulder 1I was taken up] in the presence of them.

8. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me in the morning, saying,

9. O son of man, said not to you the house  of Israel, [3house 1the 2rebelling], What are you doing?

10. Say to them, Thus says Adonai the lord; To the ruler and one guiding in Jerusalem, even to all the house of Israel, the ones who are in the midst of them.

11. Say that, I [2portents 1do]. In which manner I have done, so will it be to them -- unto displacement and in captivity they shall go.

12. And the ruler in the midst of them [2upon 3a shoulder 1shall be lifted], and being hid he shall come forth through the wall, and he shall dig through  to come forth himself through it;  [2his face 1he shall cover up], so that he should not be seen by an eye, and he [3the 4ground 1shall not 2see].

13. And I will spread forth  my net upon him, and he shall be seized in  [2encompassing about 1my]. And I will lead him into Babylon, into the land of Chaldeans. And [3it 1he shall not 2see], and [2there 1he shall come to an end].

14. And all the ones round about him,  his helpers, and all the ones assisting him, I will scatter to all the wind, and [2a broadsword 1I will pour out] after them.

15. And they shall know, for I am the lord, in  my scattering them among the nations. And I will scatter them in the places.

16. And I will leave of them a few men in number from the broadsword, and from famine, and from plague; so even they may tell in detail all  their lawless deeds among the nations of which they entered there; and they shall know that I am the lord.

17. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

18. O son of man,  [2your bread 3with 4grief 1you shall eat], and  [2your water 3with 4torment 5and 6affliction 1you shall drink].

19. And you shall say to the people of the land, Thus says Adonai the lord, to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem upon the land  of Israel;  [2their bread loaves 3with 4lack 1they shall eat], and  [2their water 3with 4obliteration 1they shall drink], so that [3should be extinct 1the 2land] with its fullness in impiety of all the ones dwelling in it.

20. And  their cities  being dwelt in shall be made quite desolate, and the land [2for 3extinction 1will be]; and you shall realize that I am the lord.

21. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

22. O son of man, what is this parable to you concerning the land  of Israel, saying, The days are far off; [3has perished 1all 2vision]?

23. On account of this, say to them! Thus says Adonai the lord; Even I will turn back  this parable, and no longer should [4speak  5this parable 1the 2house  3of Israel]. For you shall say to them, [3have approached 1The 2days], and the matter of every vision.

24. For there will no longer be any [2vision 1false], nor one using oracles  for favor in the midst of the sons of Israel.

25. For I the lord will speak  my words, and I will act; and I will not lengthen the time still. For in  your days, [2house  1O rebelling], I shall speak the word, and I will act, says Adonai the lord.

26. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

27. O son of man, behold, the house of Israel, the one rebelling. In saying they say, The vision which this man sees is for [2days 1many], and [3for 5times 4long 1this one 2prophesies].

28. On account of this, say to them! Thus says Adonai the lord; I shall not lengthen any longer all  my words which ever I should speak, for I shall speak a word, and I shall act, says Adonai the lord!  

## Ezekiel 13

1.  Ezekiel Prophesies against the Prophets And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets  of Israel, the ones prophesying! And you shall speak to the prophets, to the ones prophesying from their own heart. And you shall prophesy, and shall say to them, Hear the word of the lord!

3. Thus says Adonai the lord; Woe to the ones prophesying from their own heart, to the ones going after  their own spirit, and  altogether they do not see.

4. As foxes in the desolate places, so are your prophets, O Israel.

5. They stood not in firmness, and they gathered not flocks unto the house  of Israel; they did not rise up in war, the ones saying, In the day of the lord.

6. Ones seeing false visions, using [2oracles 1vain], the ones saying, Thus says the lord, and the lord has not sent them. And they began  to raise up a false word.

7. Have you not [3vision 2a false 1seen], and [3divinations 2vain 1spoken]? And you speak, says the lord, and I spoke not.

8. On account of this, say! Thus says Adonai the lord; Because  your words are false, and  your divinations vain, on account of this, behold, I am against you, says Adonai the lord.

9. And I will stretch out  my hand against the prophets, of the ones seeing false visions, and the ones declaring vain things in instruction  of my people. They will not be, nor [2among 3the writing 4of the house 5of Israel  1shall they be written], and into the land  of Israel they shall not enter; and they shall know that I am Adonai the lord. 

10.  The Wall shall Fall Because they misled  my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and this one builds a wall, and they plaster it -- it shall fall.

11. Say to the ones plastering it, that, It shall fall, and there shall be [2rain 1flooding], and I will appoint [2stones 1rock throwing] against  their chambers, and they shall fall; and [2wind 1a removing], and it shall be broken asunder.

12. And behold, [3has fallen 1the 2wall], (and shall they not say to you, Where is  your plaster by which you plastered it?)

13. On account of this, Thus says Adonai the lord, that, I will tear forth [2breath 1a removing] with rage, and [3rain 2a flooding 4in 5my anger 1there will be], and the stones  for rock throwing in rage I will bring unto completion.

14. And I will raze the wall which you plastered, and it shall fall. And I will put it upon the ground, and [2shall be uncovered  1its foundations], and it shall fall. And you shall be exhausted with reproofs; and you shall realize that I am the lord.

15. And I will exhaust  my rage against the wall, and upon the ones plastering it, and it shall fall. And I said to you, [3is not 1The 2wall], nor the ones plastering it --

16. the prophets  of Israel, the ones prophesying against Jerusalem, and the ones seeing her peace, and there is no peace, says Adonai the lord. 

17.  The LORD is against the False Prophetesses And you, O son of man, firmly fix  your face against the daughters  of your people! the ones prophesying from their own heart. And you prophesy against them!

18. And you shall say, Thus says Adonai the lord; Woe to the ones sewing together pillows under every elbow of the hand, and making coverings for every head of every stature  to pervert souls. The souls are perverted  of my people, and [2souls 1they protected].

19. And they profaned me before  my people for a handful of barley, and for pieces of bread loaves,  to kill the souls who must not die, and  to protect souls who must not live, in  you declaring to a people listening to vain maxims.

20. On account of this, Thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I am against  your pillows upon which you [3there 1confederate 2souls]; and I will tear them from  your arms, and I will send out the souls, the ones whom you distorted  their souls for dispersing.

21. And I will tear up  your coverings, and I will rescue  my people from out of your hand, and no longer will they be in your hands for a confederacy; and you shall realize that I am the lord.

22. Because you pervert the heart of the just wrongfully, for I did not pervert him; and  you strengthened the hands of the lawless one  altogether, to not turn him from  [3way 1his  2evil], so as to enliven him.

23. Because of this, [3false visions 1in no way 2shall you see], and [3divinations 1in no way 2shall you divine] still. And I will rescue  my people from out of your hand, and you shall know that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 14

1.  The Word against the False Prophets And there came to me men from the elders of the people of Israel, and they sat before my face.

2. And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

3. Son of man,  these men set  their thoughts in  their hearts, and [2the 3punishment  4of their iniquities 1set] before their face. Shall in answering I answer them, no.

4. On account of this, speak to them! And you shall say to them, Thus says Adonai the lord; A man, a man from out of the house of Israel who ever should put  his considerations upon  his heart, and  [2punishment  3for his iniquities 1should arrange] before his face, and should come to the false prophet; I the lord will answer him by them, in the things which are within in his mind,

5. so that he should bend away the house  of Israel according to  their hearts, the ones being separated from me in  their thoughts.

6. Because of this, say to the house  of Israel! Thus says Adonai the lord; Turn and turn away from  your practices, and from all  [2impious deeds 1your], and turn  your faces!

7. For a man, a man from the house of Israel, and from the foreigners of the ones converting in  Israel, who ever should separate from me, and set  his thoughts upon  his heart, and  [2punishment  3for his iniquities 1should arrange] before his face, and should come to the false prophet  to ask him concerning me, I the lord will answer to him in the things which he presses in them.

8. And I will firmly fix  my face against  that man, and I will appoint him for a desolate place and for extinction, and I will lift him away from the midst  of my people; and you shall realize that I am the lord.

9. And the prophet, if he should be mislead and should say a word, I the lord have misled  that prophet; and I will stretch out  my hand against him, and I will remove him from out of the midst  of my people Israel.

10. And they shall bear  their iniquity according to the offence of the one asking; likewise also the offence of the prophet it will be;

11. so that [3should not 4be misled 5still  1the house  2of Israel] from me; and that they should not be defiled still in all  their transgressions; and they will be to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, says Adonai the lord. 

12.  Noah, Daniel, and Job And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

13. O son of man, a land,  if it should sin against me  to fall into transgression, then I shall stretch out  my hand against it, and I will break its reliance on bread, and I will send upon it famine, and I will lift away [4from 5it 1man 2and 3beast].

14. And if [4might be  2three 3men 1these] in the midst of it, Noah, and Daniel, and Job, these in  their righteousness shall be delivered, says Adonai the lord.

15. And if [3wild beasts 2ferocious 1I bring] upon the land, and punish it, and it shall be for extinction, and there shall not be one traveling through because of the countenance of the wild beasts,

16. and  [2three 3men 1these] were in the midst of it; as I live, says Adonai the lord, shall sons or daughters be delivered, no. Only these alone shall be delivered, but the land will be for ruin.

17. Or even [3a broadsword 1if 2I bring] against  that land, and I should say, Let the broadsword go through the land! and I shall lift away from out of them man and beast.

18. And if [2three 3men 1these] were in the midst of it, as I live, says Adonai the lord, that in no way shall [4be rescued 1sons 2nor 3daughters], but these alone shall be delivered.

19. Or also [3a plague 1if 2I should send] as a successor upon  that land, and I shall pour out  my rage upon it in blood,  to utterly destroy from out of it man and beast,

20. and Noah, and Daniel, and Job be in the midst of it, as I live, says Adonai the lord, neither sons or daughters shall be delivered, but they in  their righteousness shall rescue  their souls.

21. Thus says Adonai the lord; But if also  [2four 3punishments 1my] -- the ferocious broadsword, and famine, and [2wild beasts 1ferocious], and plague, I should send out upon Jerusalem  to utterly destroy from out of it man and beast;

22. and behold, these being left behind in it -- the ones escaping from it, the ones who shall lead out of it sons and daughters; behold, they shall go forth to you, and you shall see  their ways, and  their thoughts; and you shall be repentant over the hurts which I brought upon Jerusalem, for all which I brought upon it.

23. That they shall comfort you, because you shall see  theirs ways and  their thoughts. and you shall realize that [2not 5in vain 1I have 3done 4all] as much as I did by it, says Adonai the lord.  

## Ezekiel 15

1.  The Parable of the Vine And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. And you, O son of man, what ever may become of the wood of the vine from out of all the woods of the branches of the ones being in the woods of the forest?

3. Shall they take of its wood  to perform for work? Shall they take from out of it stanchions  to hang [3upon 4it 1all 2items]?

4. Behold, fire is given for consumption  yearly; in the cleansing of it [3consumes 1the 2fire], and the wood vanishes in the end. Shall it be profitable for work?

5. Not even of it still being whole -- it will not be useful for work;  for if also the fire [2it 1should consume] unto completion, shall it be made for work, no.

6. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; In which manner the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given it to the fire for consumption, so I have given the ones dwelling in Jerusalem.

7. And I will put  my face against them; from out of the fire they shall come forth, and fire shall devour them; and they shall know that I am the lord in  my firmly fixing  my face against them.

8. And I will appoint the earth for extinction, because they fell into transgression, says Adonai the lord.  

## Ezekiel 16

1.  The Origins of Jerusalem And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, testify  to Jerusalem  of her lawless deeds!

3. And you shall say, Thus says Adonai the lord  to Jerusalem;  Your root and  your birth are of the land of Canaan.  Your father was an Amorite, and  your mother a Hittite.

4. And concerning your birth in which day you were born, [2was not 3severed  1your naval], and [3in 4water 1you were not 2bathed] for safety, nor [2with salt 1were you salted], and [3with swaddling-cloths 1you were not 2swaddled],

5. nor [2spare 3over 4you  1did my eye]  to do for you one of all of these things,  to suffer anything for you; and you were thrown away upon the face of the plain because of the deformity  of your life in the day you were birthed.

6. And I went unto you, and I beheld you being befouled in  your blood. And I said to you from out of  your blood -- Live! Even I said to you with  your blood -- Life.

7. Be multiplied! [3as 4the 5rising 6of the 7field 1I have made 2you]. And you were multiplied, and magnified, and entered into cities of cities.  Your breasts erected, and  your hair rose up; but you were naked and indecent.

8. And I went by you, and beheld you. And behold, it was your time, and a time of resting up. And I opened and spread out  my wings over you, and I covered  your indecency, and I swore an oath to you, and entered into a covenant with you, says Adonai the lord, and you became mine.

9. And I bathed you in water, and washed  your blood from you, and anointed you with oil.

10. And I clothed you in colored garments, and tied on you blue cloth; and I tied [2around 3you 1linen], and put around you a braided belt,

11. and adorned you with ornamentation, and put bracelets around  your hands, and a necklace around  your neck.

12. And I gave a ring for  your nose, and disks for  your ears, and a crown of boasting for  your head.

13. And you were adorned in gold and silver, and  your wraps were fine linen, and braids, and colored garments. [2fine flour 3and 4olive oil 5and 6honey 1You ate], and you became [3good 1very 2vehemently]. And you prospered for royalty.

14. And [3went forth 1your 2name] among the nations in  your beauty; because it was being completed with attractiveness, in the beauty which I ordered up for you, says Adonai the lord.

15. And you relied in  your beauty, and you committed harlotry because of  your name; and you poured out  your harlotry upon all in the byway -- it was to him. 

16.  Jerusalem Plays the Harlot And you took from  your garments, and you made for yourself idols strung together. And you fornicated upon them. And in no way should you enter nor should it be.

17. And you took the items  of your boasting from  my gold, and from  my silver of which I gave you; and you made for yourself [2images 1male], and you fornicated with them.

18. And you took  [3clothes  2colored 1your], and covered them. And  my oil and  my incense you put before their face.

19. And  my bread loaves which I gave to you, fine flour and olive oil and honey, which I fed you -- even you put them before their face for a scent of pleasant aroma. Yes, it became so, says Adonai the lord.

20. And you took  your sons and  your daughters whom you bore, and sacrificed these to them unto consumption, as [2a little 1you fornicated].

21. And you slew  your children, and gave them up in  your pacifying them to them.

22. This is beyond all your harlotry, and  your abominations. And you did not remember the days  of your infancy, when you were naked and indecent, being befouled in  your blood, and you lived.

23. And it came to pass after all  your evils -- woe, woe to you, says Adonai the lord,

24. that you built for yourself a building for a harlot; and you made for yourself a public notice in every square.

25. And upon every corner of the way you built  your places of harlotry, and laid waste  your beauty. And [3led through  4your legs 1every one 2passing by], and you multiplied  your harlotry. 

26.  Jerusalem Fornicates with the Nations And you fornicated after the sons of Egypt, of the ones adjoining you, the fleshy ones. And in many ways you fornicated  to provoke me to anger.

27. And behold, I stretch out  my hand against you, and I will lift away  your laws, and deliver you up to the souls detesting you, daughters of Philistines, the ones turning aside from out of  your way, of which you were impious.

28. And you fornicated with the sons of Assyria, and neither thus were you satisfied. Yes, you fornicated, and you were not satisfied.

29. And you multiplied  your harlotries with the land of Canaan, and to the Chaldeans; and not even in these were you satisfied.

30. What shall I do to your heart, says Adonai the lord, while you do all these things, works of a woman harlot speaking openly. And you fornicated thrice among  your daughters --

31. in  your building  your place of harlotry at the top of every street; and  [2your base 1you made] in every square; and you became not even as a harlot bringing together hires.

32. The wife  committing adultery is likened to you, the one [3from  4her husband 1taking 2wages],

33. and to all the ones fornicating with her she gave [2in addition 1wages]. And you have given wages to all  your lovers; and you loaded them  to come to you round about in  your harlotry.

34. And became in you a perverseness beyond the other women in the harlotry of your harlotry, and with you, which they shall commit harlotry. For in your giving [2in addition 1wages], (and wages were not given to you,) [2has taken place 3in 4you 1a perverseness].

35. On account of this, O harlot, hear the word of the lord! 

36.  The LORD's Judgment on Jerusalem Thus says Adonai the lord; Because you poured out  your brass money, therefore [2shall be uncovered  1your shame] in  your harlotry with  your lovers, and into all the thoughts  of your lawlessnesses, and in the blood  of your children which you have given to them.

37. On account of this, behold, I [2against 3you 1will gather] all  your lovers in which you intermixed with them, and all whom you loved, with all the ones whom you detested. And I will bring them together against you round about. And I will uncover  your evils to them, and they shall see all  your shame.

38. And I will punish you with the punishment of adulterous one, and one pouring out of blood. And I will appoint you for blood of rage and zeal.

39. And I will deliver you into their hands. And they shall raze  your place of harlotry, and demolish  your base, and take off   your garments, and take the items  of your boasting, and shall leave you naked and indecent.

40. And they shall lead [2against 3you 1multitudes], and shall stone you with stones, and shall butcher you with  their swords.

41. And they shall burn  your houses by fire, and they shall execute among you acts of vengeance before [2women 1many]. And I will turn you from harlotry, and [3for wages 1in no way 2will I give you up] any longer.

42. And I will slacken  my rage against you, and [2shall be removed  1my jealousy] from you. And I will rest, and in no way will I be anxious any longer.

43. Because you did not remember the day  of your infancy, and you caused me to fret in all these things; and behold, I  [2your ways 3upon 4your head 1have imputed], says Adonai the lord; and so you shall not commit  impiety above all  your lawless deeds.

44. These are all as much as they spoke against you in a parable, saying, As the mother, so also the daughter.

45. [3the 4daughter  5of your mother 1you 2are], the one thrusting away  her husband, and  her children; and sister  of your brethren, of the ones thrusting away  their husbands and  their children.  Your mother was a Hittite, and  your father an Amorite. 

46.  Jerusalem is Compared to Samaria and Sodom  [3sister 1Your  2older], she is Samaria, even  her daughters  dwelling on your left. And  [3sister 1your  2younger], the one dwelling on your right is Sodom and  her daughters.

47. And neither as in  their ways were you gone, nor according to  their lawless deeds acted even a little, but you take precedence over them in all  your ways.

48. As I live, says Adonai the lord, Has [3done 1Sodom  2your sister], she and  her daughters, in which manner you did, you and  your daughters?

49. Besides this, the violation of Sodom  your sister -- pride; in fullness of bread and in prosperity they lived extravagantly, she and  her daughters; this existed in her and  her daughters, and [3the hand 4of the poor 5and 6needy 1they did not 2assist].

50. And they bragged, and committed violations of the law before me. And I removed them as you saw.

51. And Samaria [3according to 4the 5halves  6of your sins 1did not 2sin]. But you multiplied  your lawless deeds above them, and justified  your sisters in all  your lawless deeds which you did.

52. And you, carry  your torment! by which you corrupted  your sisters in  your sins which you acted lawlessly above them, and justified them above yourself. And you, be ashamed and take  your dishonor! in that you justified  your sisters.

53. And I will return  their rejection, the rejection of Sodom and  her daughters; and I will return the rejection of Samaria and  her daughters; and I will return  your rejection in the midst of them;

54. so that you should carry  your torment, and be disgraced from all which you did in  your provoking me to anger.

55. And  your sister Sodom and  her daughters shall be restored as they were from the beginning. And Samaria and  her daughters shall be restored as they were from the beginning. And you and  your daughters shall be restored as you were from the beginning.

56. And was not Sodom  your sister for a report in  your mouth in the days  of your pride,

57. before the uncovering  of your evils, in which manner [2now 3the scorn 1you are] of the daughters of Syria, and all the ones round about you, even the daughters of the Philistines, of the ones compassing you round about?

58. As for your impious and  your lawless deeds, you have carried them, says the lord.

59. Thus says Adonai the lord; And I will do among you as you did, as you disgraced  this oath to violate  my covenant.

60. And I will remember  my covenant, of the one with you in the days of your infancy. And I will reestablish with you  [2covenant 1an everlasting].

61. And you shall remember  your way, and you shall be despised in  your taking up  your sisters,  your older ones with  your younger ones; and I will give them to you for edifying, but not out of your covenant.

62. And I will reestablish  my covenant with you, and you shall realize that I am the lord;

63. so that you should remember and should be ashamed, and it might not be for you still to open  your mouth because of the face  of your dishonor in  my atoning you according to all as much as you did, says Adonai the lord.  

## Ezekiel 17

1.  The Eagles and the Vine And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, Describe a tale, and speak a parable to the house  of Israel!

3. And you shall say, Thus says Adonai the lord; The [2eagle  1great]  having large wings,  [2long  1stretching out], full of claws, who has the leading to enter into  Lebanon -- even he took the choice  cedar.

4. The tips of the tender part he plucked off, and he brought them into the land of Canaan, [3into 4a city 5being walled 1he put 2them].

5. And he took from the seed of the land, and he put it into the ground fit for sowing as a plant by [2water 1much]; [3for attention 1he arranged 2it].

6. And it arose and became a vine being weakened and small  in greatness  [4to be apparent  1for its vine branches 2upon 3it]; and  its roots [2underneath 3it 1were]. And it became a vine, and produced layers of vines, and stretched out  its tendrils.

7. And there was [3eagle 1another 2great] having large wings, and many claws. And behold,  her grapevine was being twisted unto him, and  her roots unto him, and  her vine branches she sent out to him,  to water her with the casting away from  her planting.

8. In [2ground 1good] upon [2water 1much] she was fattened  to produce buds and to bear fruit,  to be made into [2vine 1a great].

9. On account of this, say! Thus says Adonai the lord; Shall it prosper, no. Shall not the roots  of her tenderness, and the fruits rot? Yes, [3shall be dried up 1all  2her things shooting up early], and not by [2arm 1a great], nor by [2people 1many]  to pull her out by her roots.

10. And behold, she was fattened; should she prosper? Shall she not in  her being touched by [2wind  1the burning] be dried up in dryness? With the casting  of her east wind she shall be dried up.

11. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

12. Say indeed to the [2house  1rebelling], Do you not know what these are? You speak to them! Behold, [3comes 1the king 2of Babylon] unto Jerusalem, and he shall take  her king, and  her rulers. And he shall lead them to himself unto Babylon.

13. And he shall take of the seed of the kingdom, and shall ordain with him a covenant, and shall bring him by an oath; and [2the 3governors 4of the 5land 1he shall take],

14.  to become a [2kingdom 1weak], so that altogether it should not lift itself up; but to keep  its covenant and to establish her.

15. And he shall revolt from him  to send messengers unto Egypt,  to give to him horses and [2people 1many]. Shall he prosper, no. Shall [4be preserved 1the one 2acting 3opposite], no. And [2one violating 3covenant 1shall] be preserved, no.

16. As I live, says Adonai the lord, Surely in the place of the king, of the one giving him reign, who disgraced  my oath, and violated  my covenant, [2with 3him 4in 5the midst 6of Babylon 1he shall come to an end].

17. And not by [2power 1great] nor by [2multitude 1a great] shall [2make 4with 5him 1Pharaoh 3war], in throwing up a palisade and with construction of a range of weapons  to remove [2souls 1many].

18. And he disgraced the swearing of an oath  violating the covenant; and behold, he appointed  his hand, and all these things he did to him, he shall not escape.

19. On account of this say! Thus says Adonai the lord; As I live, surely  swearing by my oath which he disgraced, and  my covenant which he violated, that I will impute it on his head.

20. And I will spread forth upon him  my net, and he shall be captured in  his being encompassed about. And I will lead him into Babylon. And I shall litigate with him there concerning  his iniquity of which he transgressed against me.

21. In all  his exiles, in every battle array of his, [2by 3the broadsword 1they shall fall], and the remaining [2unto 3every 4wind 1I shall scatter]. And you shall realize that I the lord have spoken.

22. For thus says Adonai the lord; And I will take, even I of the chosen of the cedar, from its top; and I will give of the head of her shoots; [2of 3her heart 1I will pluck off], and I will plant upon [2mountain 1a high].

23. And I will hang him on [2mountain 1an elevated] of Israel; and I will plant it, and there shall be brought forth a bud, and he shall produce fruit, and he will be for [2cedar 1a great]; and there shall rest underneath him every bird; and every winged creature [2under 3the 4shadow  5of his tender branches 1shall rest]; and  his vine branches shall be restored.

24. And [6shall know 1all 2the 3trees 4of the 5plain] that I am the lord, the one humbling [2tree 1the high], and raising up high [2tree 1the low]; and drying [2tree 1the green], and again flourishing [2tree 1the dry]. I the lord, I have spoken and I shall act.  

## Ezekiel 18

1.  Parable of the Unripe Grapes And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, What to you is this parable concerning the land  of Israel, saying, The fathers ate an unripe grape, and the teeth of the children have a toothache?

3. As I live, says Adonai the lord, Shall [3still be 1the saying  2of this parable] in  Israel? 

4.  The Soul Who Sins Shall Die For all the souls are mine; in which manner the soul of the father, also the soul of the son; they are mine. The soul  sinning, this one shall die.

5. But the man who will be just, the one executing equity and righteousness,

6. [3upon 4the 5mountains 1he shall not 2eat to idols], and  his eyes in no way shall be lifted up to the thoughts of the house of Israel; and the wife  of his neighbor in no way shall he defile, and to the wife [2in 3menstruation 1being] he shall not draw near,

7. and [3a man 1in no way 2shall he tyrannize over], and collateral taken as a pledge being owed he shall give back, and things for seizure he shall not seize by force, and  [2his bread 3to the one 4hungering 1he shall give], and [2the naked 1he shall cover] with a garment;

8.  [3his money 4with 5interest 1he shall not 2give], and [3by usury 1shall not 2take money]; [3from 4injustice 1he shall turn  2his hand]; [3judgment 2a just 1he shall execute] between a man and  his neighbor;

9. and [2by  3my orders 1he shall go], and  [2my ordinances 1shall guard]  to do them -- [3just 1this one 2is]; to life he shall live, says Adonai the lord.

10. And if he engenders [2son 1a mischievous], one pouring out blood and committing sins, and

11. [2in 3the 4way  7father 5of his  6just 1he went not], but also upon the mountains he ate to idols, and the wife  of his neighbor he defiled,

12. and [2the poor 3and 4needy 1tyrannized over], and seized by force, and [3collateral taken as a pledge 1did not 2give back], and for the idols put  his eyes [2lawlessness 1to do],

13. and with interest gave a thing, and by usury took; this one [3to life 1shall not 2live]; all  these lawless deeds he did; unto death he shall be put to death;  his blood [2upon 3him 1will be].

14. And if he should engender a son, and he should behold all the sins  of his father which he did, and should fear and should not do according to these,

15. [3upon 4the 5mountains 1and has not 2eaten], and  [2his eyes 1put not] onto the thoughts of the house of Israel, and [2the 3wife  4of his neighbor 1defiled not],

16. and [2a man 1tyrannized not over], and took not collateral for security, and by seizure seized not by force;  [2his bread 3to the hungry 1but gave], and [2the naked 1covered] with a garment,

17. and [3from 4injustice 1turned  2his hand], [3interest 4and 5usury 1and did not 2take money from], [2righteousness 1and executed], and [2by  3my orders 1went]; he shall not come to an end by the iniquities  of his father; to life he shall live.

18.  But if his father by affliction afflicted, and by seizure seized by force, and [2contrary 1did] in the midst  of his people, then he shall die in  his iniquity.

19. And you shall say, Why is it that [3does not take 1the 2son] the iniquity  of his father? Because the son [2equity 3and 4righteousness 5and 6mercy 1has done]. All  my laws he preserved, and he did them; to life he shall live.

20. But the soul  sinning, it shall die. And the son shall not take the iniquity of the father. And the father shall not take the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the just one [2upon 3him 1shall be], and the lawlessness of the lawless one [2upon 3him 1shall be]. 

21.  The Repentant One Shall Live And the lawless one, if he should turn from all  his lawless deeds which he did, and should keep all  my commandments, and should do equity and righteousness and mercy; to life he shall live, and he shall not die.

22. All  of his transgressions, as many as he did, they shall not be remembered to him; in  his righteousness which he did he shall live.

23. By volition do I want the death of the lawless one, says Adonai the lord? No, But as  to turn him from  [3way 1his  2evil] and to enliven him.

24. But in the turning the just from  his righteousness, and he should commit iniquity, according to all the iniquities which [3did 1the 2lawless one]; if he should do thus, he shall not live. In all the things of his righteousness, which he did, in no way shall they be remembered; in  his transgression in which he fell, and in  his sins in which he sinned, in them he shall die.

25. And you said, [4is not straight 1The 2way 3of the lord]. Hear indeed house of Israel! Is  my way not straight? Is it  that your ways are straight?

26. In the turning of the just from  his righteousness, and he should commit transgression, and he should die in the transgression which he did; [2in 3it 1he shall die].

27. And in the [2turning 1lawless one] from  his lawlessness which he did, and he shall act with equity and righteousness, this one  [2his soul 1kept].

28. For he saw and turned from all  his impiety which he did; to life he shall live, in no way shall he die.

29. And [4says 1the 2house  3of Israel], [4is not 5straight 1The 2way 3of the lord]. Is  my way not straight, O house of Israel? Is it  your way that is not straight?

30. Therefore [3each 4according to  5his way 1I shall judge 2you], O house of Israel, says Adonai the lord. Be restored and turn from all  your impiety, and [3shall not be 4to you  1punishment 2of iniquity]!

31. Throw away from yourself all  your impiety which you were impious against me, and make to yourself [2heart 1a new] and [2spirit 1a new]! And why do you die, O house of Israel?

32. For I do not want the death of the one dying, says Adonai the lord. Return then! and you shall live.  

## Ezekiel 19

1.  A Parable of Lamentation And you, take up a lamentation against the ruler  of Israel!

2. And you shall say, Why  [2your mother 3among 4cubs 5in 6the midst 7of lions 1became]? In the midst of lions she multiplied her cubs.

3. And [3leaped 1one  2of her cubs]; [2a lion 1he became] and learned  to seize by force; [2the prey 3of men 1he ate].

4. And [2heard 3concerning 4him 1nations]; and he was seized in  their corruption, and they led him in a wicker cage into the land of Egypt.

5. And she beheld that he was thrust away from her, and [2perished  1her support], and she took another from  her cubs; [3to be a lion 1she ordered 2him].

6. And he paced in the midst of lions; [2a lion 1he became], and learned to seize prey, and [2men 1he devoured].

7. And he fed in  his boldness, and  [2their cities 1made] quite desolate; and he obliterated the land and the fullness of it by the voice of his roaring.

8. And [2assailed 3against 4him 1nations] round about of the places; and they spread forth upon him their nets; and in  their corruption he was seized.

9. And they put him in a cage, even in a wicker cage, and they led him to the king of Babylon. And they brought him into prison, so that [2should not 3be heard  1his voice] any more upon the mountains  of Israel.

10.  Your mother was as a vine, as a flower of a pomegranate [2by 3water 1being planted];  her fruit and  her bud took place because of [2water 1much].

11. And she became a rod of strength over a tribe of ones leading; and she was raised up high in her greatness in the midst of the trunks; and she beheld  her greatness in the multitude of her branches.

12. But she was broken off in pieces in rage; [2upon 3the 4ground 1she was tossed], and [2wind 1the burning] dried  her choice branches. [4were punished 5and 6 were dried 1The 2rods  3of her strength]; fire consumed her.

13. And now they have planted her in the wilderness, in [2land 1a waterless] and one thirsting.

14. And [2came forth 1fire] from out of a rod [2choice ones 1of her] and devoured her; and [3was not 4in 5her 1a rod 2of strength]. [2a tribe 3for 4a parable 5of lamentation 1She is], and will be for a lamentation.  

## Ezekiel 20

1.  Ezekiel Speaks to the Elders And it came to pass in the [2year  1seventh], in the fifth month, tenth of the month, there came men from the elders of the house of Israel to ask of the lord. And they sat before my face.

2. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

3. O son of man, speak to the elders  of Israel! and you shall say to them, Thus says Adonai the lord; Are [3to ask 4me 1you 2come]? As I live, I shall not be answering to you, says Adonai the lord.

4. Shall I punish them with punishment, O son of man? [3of the 4lawless deeds  5of their fathers 1Testify 2to them]!

5. And you shall say to them, Thus says the lord; From which day I took up the house  of Israel, and made known to the seed of the house  of Jacob, and was known by them in the land of Egypt, and took hold of  [2with my hand 1them], saying, I am the lord  your God.

6. In that  day I took hold of them  by my hand,  to lead them from out of the land of Egypt, into the land which I prepared for them; a land flowing milk and honey, the honeycomb is beyond every  land.

7. And I said to them, Let each [2the 3abominations  4of his eyes 1throw away]! and in the practices of Egypt be not defiled! I am the lord  your God.

8. And they revolted from me, and wanted not to listen to me. Each [2the 3abominations  4of their eyes 1threw not away], and the practices of Egypt they abandoned not. And I spoke  to pour out  my rage upon them;  to complete  my anger among them in the midst  of Egypt.

9. And I acted so that  my name  should not be thoroughly profaned before the nations which they are in the midst of them, to the ones whom I made known to them of their presence,  to lead them from out of the land of Egypt.

10. And I led them from the land of Egypt, and I led them into the wilderness.

11. And I gave them  my orders, and  [2my ordinances 1I made known] to them; how if [2should do 3them 1a man] then he shall live by them.

12. And  my Sabbaths I gave to them,  to be for a sign between me and between them,  for them to know that I am the lord, the one sanctifying them.

13. And [4greatly embittered 5me 1the 2house  3of Israel] in the wilderness. In  my orders they did not go, and  my ordinances they thrust away, which [2shall do 3them 1a man] and shall live by them. And  [2my Sabbaths 1they profaned] exceedingly. And I spoke  to pour out  my rage upon them in the wilderness,  to completely consume them.

14. And I acted so that  my name  should not be thoroughly profaned before the nations which I led them out before their eyes.

15. And I lifted  my hand against them in the wilderness, the thorough one,  to not bring them into the land which I gave to them, a land flowing milk and honey; (the honeycomb is beyond all the land).

16. Because  [2my ordinances 1they thrusted away], and in  my orders they went not by them; and  [2my Sabbaths 1they profaned], and [2after 3the 4thoughts  5of their hearts 1they went].

17. And [2spared 3them  1my eye]  to not wipe them away, and I did not commit them unto consumption in the wilderness.

18. And I said to  their children in the wilderness, [2in 3the 4laws  5of your fathers 1Do not go], and  [3their ordinances 1do not 2keep], and [3in  4their practices 1do not 2intermingle], and be not defiled!

19. I am the lord  your God; [2by  3my orders 1go], and  [2my ordinances 1keep], and do them!

20. And  my Sabbaths -- sanctify them! and it will be for a sign between me and you,  to know that I am the lord  your God.

21. And they rebelled against me. And  their children [2by  3my orders 1went not]. And  my ordinances they guarded not  to do them, which [2does 1if a man] then he shall live by them. And  my Sabbaths they profaned. And I spoke  to pour out  my rage upon them, and  to complete  my anger against them in the wilderness.

22. And I turned  my hand against them, and I acted because of myself, so that  my name  [3thoroughly 1should not 2be] profaned before the nations; from whom I led them out before their eyes.

23. And I lifted up  my hand against them in the wilderness,  to disperse them among the nations, and to scatter them in the places;

24. because  [3my ordinances 1they did not 2observe], and  [2my orders 1they thrusted away], and  [2my Sabbaths 1profaned], and [3after 4the 5thoughts  6of their fathers 2were  1their eyes].

25. And I gave them up to orders that were not good, and ordinances in which they shall not live by them.

26. And I will defile them in  their decrees in  my traveling by every one opening wide the womb, so that I should obliterate them, that thay shall know that I am the lord.

27. On account of this, speak to the house  of Israel, O son of man! And you shall say to them, Thus says Adonai the lord; Until this time [2provoked me to anger  1your fathers] in  their transgressions, in which they fell against me.

28. And I brought them into the land which I lifted up  my hand  to give it to them. And they beheld every [2hill 1high], and every [2tree 1shady]. And they sacrificed there to their gods. And they arranged there the wrath of the gift offerings. And they arranged there a scent of their pleasant aroma offering. And they offered a libation there of their libation offerings.

29. And I said to them, What is Abama, that you enter there? And they called upon  its name, Abama, until  today's day. 

30.  Judgment and Restoration On account of this, say to the house  of Israel! Thus says Adonai the lord; Shall [3in 4the 5lawless deeds  6of your fathers 1you 2defile yourselves]? and [3after  4their abominations 1do you 2fornicate]?

31. And in the first-fruits  of your gifts, and in  your offerings, in the passing through  your children in fire, you defiled yourselves in all  your thoughts until  today's day. And shall I answer you, O house  of Israel, no. As I live, says Adonai the lord, Shall I answer you, and shall [2ascend 3upon  4your spirit 1this thing], no.

32. And it will not be in which manner that you say, We will be as the nations, and as the tribes of the earth,  to serve wood and stone idols.

33. On account of this, as I live, says Adonai the lord, with [2hand 1a fortified] and with [2arm 1a high], and with rage being poured forth, I will reign over you.

34. And I will lead you from out of the peoples, and I will take you from out of the places of which you were dispersed in them, with [2hand 1a fortified] and with [2arm 1a high], and with rage being poured forth.

35. And I will lead you into the wilderness of the peoples, and I will litigate for you there face to face.

36. In which manner I litigated for  your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I judge you, says Adonai the lord.

37. And I will lead you by  my rod, and I will bring you in by number.

38. And I shall choose from you the impious, and the ones revolting; because [3from out of  4their sojourning 1I will lead 2them], and [3into 4the 5land  6of Israel 1they shall not 2enter]. And you shall realize that I am the lord.

39. And to you, O house of Israel, thus says Adonai the lord; [2each  4his evil practices 1Let 3remove]! And after these things, if you listen to me, and  [5name 3my  4holy 1shall not 2profane] any longer by  your gifts, and by  your practices,

40. that upon  [3mountain 1my  2holy], upon [2mountain 1the high] of Israel, says Adonai the lord, there [4shall serve 5to me 1all 2the house 3of Israel] unto the end upon the land. And there I will favorably receive them, and there I shall watch  your first-fruits, and the first-fruits  of your offerings in all  your sanctified things.

41. In a scent of pleasant aroma I will favorably receive you, in  my leading you from out of the peoples, and to take you from out of the places in which you were dispersed in them. And I shall be sanctified in you before the eyes of the peoples.

42. And you shall realize that I am the lord, in  my bringing you into the land  of Israel, into which I lifted  my hand  to give it to your fathers.

43. And you shall remember [2there  1your ways], and  your practices which you defiled yourselves by them. And you shall beat  your faces over all  your evils.

44. And you shall realize that I am the lord in  my doing thus to you, so that  my name should not be profaned, not according to  [3ways 1your  2evil], nor according to  [3practices 1your  2corrupting], O house of Israel, says Adonai the lord.

45. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

46. O son of man, firmly fix  your face against Teman, and look upon Daror, and prophesy against the grove leading to Negev!

47. And you shall say to the grove of Negev, Hear the word of the lord! Thus says the lord; Behold, I kindle in you a fire, and it shall devour in you every [2tree 1green], and every [2tree 1dry]. [4shall not 5be extinguished 1The 2flame  3being lit up], and [7shall be incinerated 8by 9it 1every 2face 3from 4the east wind 5unto 6the north].

48. And [3shall realize 1all 2flesh] that I am the lord. I kindled it, and it shall not be extinguished.

49. And I said, By no means, O lord, O Lord, these shall say to me, [2not 4a parable 1Is 5being spoken 3this]?  

## Ezekiel 21

1.  Babylon -- God's Sword of Judgment And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. On account of this, prophesy O son of man, and firmly fix  your face against Jerusalem, and look upon  their holy places, and prophesy against the land  of Israel!

3. And you shall say to the land  of Israel, Thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I am against you, and I will pull  my knife from out of  its sheath, and I will utterly destroy from you the lawless one and unjust one.

4. Because I will utterly destroy [4from out of 5you 1the unjust one 2and 3the lawless one], so shall [2come forth  1my knife] from out of  its sheath against all flesh, from the east unto the north.

5. And [3shall realize 1all 2flesh] that I the lord pulled out  my knife from out of  its sheath; and it shall not turn back any longer.

6. And you, O son of man, groan in the breaking of your loins. And in griefs you shall moan before their eyes.

7. And it will be if they should say to you, For what reason do you moan? that you shall say, For the message, for it comes, and [3shall be devastated 1every 2heart], and [3shall be disabled 1all 2hands], and [3shall expire 1all 2flesh], and every spirit, and all thighs shall be tainted by wetness. Behold, it comes and it shall be, says the lord  God.

8. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

9. O son of man, prophesy! And you shall say, Thus says Adonai the lord; Say, O broadsword, O broadsword, sharpen and be enraged!

10. so that you should slay victims for slaughter. Be sharpened! so that you should become  shiny. Prepare for paralysis! Slay! Treat with contempt! Put aside every tree!

11. And he made it ready  [2to hold 1for his hand]. [3is made very sharp 1The 2broadsword], it is ready  to put it into the hand of one piercing.

12. Shout aloud and shriek, O son of man! for it happened unto  my people. It is come upon all the ones guiding  Israel. They shall sojourn upon the broadsword. It happened unto  my people. On account of this, clap with  your hand!

13. for justice has been done. And what if even the tribe be thrust away? It will not be, says Adonai the lord.

14. And you, O son of man, prophesy, and clap hand upon hand! And repeat the broadsword! The third broadsword is of slain ones, [3broadsword 4of the slain 1the 2great]. And you shall amaze them,

15. so that [3should be devastated 1the 2heart], and [3should be multiplied 1the ones 2being weakened] at every gate of theirs. They have been delivered up as victims for slaughter by the broadsword. Well done keen one being for slaughter. Well done one being for shining. As lightning go forth!

16. Sharpen from the right and from the left! wherever  your face should be aroused.

17. [3also 2I 1And] will clap my hand to my hand, and I will slacken  my rage; I the lord, have spoken.

18. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

19. And you, O son of man, set in order to yourself two ways!  [4to enter 1for the broadsword 2of the king 3of Babylon]. From out of [2place 1one] shall come forth the two companies; and [2a hand 3at 4the top 5of the street 6of the city 7upon 8the corner 9of the street 1set in order],

20. for the [2to enter 1broadsword] upon Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and upon  Judah, and upon Jerusalem in an assault.

21. For [3shall stand 1the king 2of Babylon] upon the ancient way, upon the corner of the two streets  to use oracles for divination,  to stir up the rod, and to ask among the carved images, and [2livers 1to watch].

22. From his right became the oracle against Jerusalem,  to throw up a siege mound,  to open wide the mouth in yelling, to raise up high a voice with a cry,  to throw up a siege mound against  her gates, and to throw up an embankment, and to build a range of weapons.

23. And he to them was as one using oracles for divination before them, and he himself calling to mind their iniquity  to be seized.

24. On account of this, Thus says Adonai the lord Because you called to mind  your iniquities in the uncovering  of your impiety  to see  your sins, in all  your lawlessnesses, and in all  your practices; because you called to mind, in these you shall be captured.

25. And you, O profane lawless one guiding  Israel, whose [2is come  1day] in time of iniquity -- an end,

26. thus says Adonai the lord; Remove the turban, and put aside the crown! This [2not 4such 1will 3be]. You abased the high, and raised up high the low.

27. Injustice, Injustice, I will appoint it. Neither this [2such 1will be] until of which time [3shall come 1the one who 2is fit], and I will deliver up to him. 

28.  Judgment against the Sons of Ammon And you, O son of man, prophesy! And you shall say, Thus says Adonai the lord to the sons of Ammon, and concerning  their scorning. And you shall say, O broadsword, O broadsword, being unsheathed for victims for slaughter, and being unsheathed for consummation, arise so as to shine!

29. In  [3vision 1your  2vain], and in  your using [2oracles 1lying]  to deliver yourself upon the necks of the slain lawless ones which is come the day in the time of iniquity -- the end.

30. Return to  your sheath! In  this place which you were engendered in  [2land  1your own], I will judge you.

31. And I will pour out upon you  my anger. In the fire of my anger I will breathe against you, and I will deliver you into the hands [2men 1of barbaric] contriving corruption.

32. By fire you will be a thing devoured;  your blood will be in the midst  of your land; in no way shall there be memory of you; for I the lord have spoken.  

## Ezekiel 22

1.  The Sins of Jerusalem And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. And you, O son of man, shall you judge the city  of blood? Yes, hold her forth for an example for all  her lawless deeds!

3. And you shall say, Thus says the Lord the lord; O city shedding blood in the midst of herself,  [2should come 1so that her time], and prepares thoughts against herself,  to defile herself.

4. In  your blood which you shed, you have fallen; and in  your ideas which you produced you defiled yourself; and [2drew near  1your days], and brought on the time of your years. On account of this I have given you for scorning by the nations, and for mocking by all the regions,

5. the ones near to you, and the ones far at a distance from you. And they shall mock against you, [3unclean 1O one 2famously], and great in  lawless deeds.

6. Behold, the ones guiding the house of Israel each [2with  3his relatives 1blends together] against you, so as to shed blood.

7. [2father 3and 4mother 1They spoke evil of] among you. And against the foreigner they behaved with injustice among you. Orphan and widow they tyrannize among you.

8. And  my holy things they treat with contempt, and  my Sabbaths they profaned among you.

9. The men were robbers among you, so that they shed blood among you. And [2upon 3the 4mountains to idols 1they were eating] among you. [2unholiness 1They committed] in your midst.

10. [2the shame 3of the father 1They uncovered] among you; and [3in her 4uncleannesses 2the woman sitting apart 1they abased] among you.

11. Each with the wife  of his neighbor acted lawlessly; and each  [2his daughter-in-law 1defiled] in impiety; and each  [2his sister 3the daughter  4of his father 1abased] among you.

12. [2bribes 1They took] among you so that they should shed blood. Interest and usury they received among you; and you completed the consummation of your evil  by tyranny; [3me 1and 2you forgot], says Adonai the lord.

13. And if I should strike my hand against my hand against the evils which you have been exhausted in the things which you did, and against the blood shed by you  being in your midst,

14. shall [2stand  1your heart], no. Shall [2hold  1your hands] in the days in which I do unto you, no. I the lord have spoken, and I will do it.

15. And I will disperse you among the nations, and I will scatter you among the regions, and [2shall vanish  1your uncleanness] from you.

16. And I will allot among you before the eyes of the nations, and you shall know that I am the lord. 

17.  Israel Cast into a Furnace And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

18. O son of man, behold, [4has become 5to me 1the 2house 3of Israel] an intermingling of all brass, and iron, and tin, and lead; [2in 3the midst 4of a furnace 5of silver 6being intermingled 1they are].

19. On account of this, say! Thus says Adonai the lord; Because you became all for [2admixture 1one], on account of this I will take you in the midst of Jerusalem.

20. As [2is taken 1silver], and brass, and iron, and tin, and lead in the midst of the furnace,  to blow [2into 3it 1fire], for the casting in a furnace. So I will take you in  my anger, and in  my rage, and I will gather and cast you in a furnace.

21. And I will blow upon you in the fire of my anger, and you shall be cast in a furnace in the midst of it.

22. In which manner [2is cast in a furnace 1silver] in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be cast in a furnace in the midst of it. And you shall realize that I the lord poured out  my rage upon you. 

23.  Condemnation on the Land And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

24. O son of man, say to her! You are the land, the land not having rain, nor rain came upon you in the day of anger.

25. Of whom the ones guiding in her midst are as [2lions 1roaring 3seizing 5by force 4prey]; [2souls 1devouring] by domination, and [2honor 1taking]; and  your widows are multiplied in your midst.

26. And  her priests annulled  my law, and they profaned  my holy things. Between holy and profane they distinguished not, and between unclean and the clean they distinguished not; and from  my Sabbaths they covered up  their eyes, and I was profaned in their midst.

27.  Her rulers in her midst are as wolves seizing prey  to shed blood,  to destroy lives, so that their desire for wealth should overabound.

28. And  her prophets anointing them shall fall seeing vanities, using [2oracles 1lying], saying, Thus says Adonai the lord, but the lord has not spoken.

29. The people of the land are pressuring iniquity, and tearing in pieces the prey, [2the poor 3and 4needy 1tyrannizing], and [5to 6the 7foreigner 1not 2behaving 3with 4equity].

30. And I sought of them a man behaving rightly, and standing before my face soundly in the time of the anger, so as to not [2unto 3the end 1wipe her away] -- but I did not find.

31. And I poured out upon her  my rage, by the fire of my anger,  to complete it.  [2their ways 3unto 4their heads 1I have imputed], says Adonai the Lord.  

## Ezekiel 23

1.  The Two Harlot Sisters And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, [2two 3women 1there were], daughters [2mother 1of one].

3. And they fornicated in Egypt; in  their youth they committed harlotry. There [2fell  1their breasts]; there they lost their virginity.

4. And  their names -- Aholah the elder, and Aholibah  her sister. And they were born to me, and gave birth to sons and daughters. And  their names -- Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem is Aholibah. 

5.  Aholah is Samaria And Aholah fornicated from me, and doted upon  her lovers, upon the Assyrians  being next to her;

6. ones being clothed in blue, leaders and commandants, young men, [2choice 1all] horsemen riding upon horses.

7. And she offered  her harlotry unto them; the choice sons of the Assyrians -- all; and upon all upon whom she doted herself. With all  her thoughts she defiled herself.

8. And  her harlotry, the one with Egypt she did not abandon, for [2with 3her 1they went to bed] in her youth, and they caused her loss of virginity, and they poured out  their harlotry upon her.

9. On account of this I delivered her up into the hands  of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

10. They uncovered  her shame. [3sons 4and 5daughters 2her 1They took], and [2her 3by 4the broadsword 1they killed]. And she became a discussion for women; and they executed acts of vengeance in her. 

11.  Aholibah is Jerusalem And [3saw  1her sister 2Aholibah], and she corrupted  her undertaking above her sister, and  her harlotry above the harlotry  of her sister.

12. [2upon 3the 4sons 5of the 6Assyrians 1She doted], the leaders, and commandants near her, ones being clothed elegantly, horsemen riding upon horses, young men, all choice.

13. And I beheld that they were defiled; it was [2way 1one] for the two of them.

14. And she added unto  her harlotry, and she saw men having been portrayed upon the wall, images of Chaldeans having been portrayed with a stylus;

15. having [2tied 1colored belts] upon  their loins; deeply dyed apparel upon  their heads; [2with the appearance 3of officials 1all], a likeness of sons of Babylon of the Chaldeans, of the land of their fatherland.

16. And she doted upon them with the vision  of her eyes; and she sent out messengers to them, into the land of the Chaldeans.

17. And [3came 4to 5her 1sons 2of Babylon], to her marriage-bed resting up, and they defiled her with  their harlotry. And she was defiled by them, and [2separated  1her soul] unto them.

18. And she uncovered  her harlotry, and uncovered  her shame. And [2separated  1my soul] from her in which manner [2separated  1my soul] from  her sister.

19. And you multiplied  your harlotry  to call to mind the day of your youth in which you committed harlotry in Egypt.

20. And you doted upon the Chaldeans, which  their flesh is as flesh of donkeys, and [2as genitals 3of horses  1their genitals].

21. And you overlooked the lawlessness  of your youth, which you did in Egypt in  your lodging, of which place the breasts  of your youth fell. 

22.  Judgment against Jerusalem On account of this, O Aholibah, thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I awaken  your lovers against you, of whom [2is separated  1your soul] unto them. And I will bring them against you round about;

23. sons of Babylon and all the Chaldeans -- Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the sons of the Assyrians with them; [2young men 1choice], governors and commandants, all tribunes, and famous ones riding upon horses.

24. And they shall come upon you all from the north with weapons, and chariots, and wheels, and a multitude of peoples, and chest plates, and shields, and helmets -- they shall be placed around about you, and they shall throw upon you a watch round about. And I will impute [2before 3their face 1judgment], and they shall punish you in  their judgments.

25. And I will put  my jealousy against you. And they shall deal with you in an anger of rage. [2your nose 3and  4your ears 1They shall remove]; and  [2your remnant 3with 4a broadsword 1they shall throw down]. They [2your sons 3and  4your daughters 1shall take], and  your remnant shall be devoured by fire.

26. And they shall strip [2off 3you  1your clothes], and shall take the items  of your boasting.

27. And I will turn  your impious deeds from you, and  your harlotry from the land of Egypt, and in no way shall you lift up  your eyes unto them; and [3Egypt 1in no way 2shall you remember] any more.

28. For thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I deliver you into the hands which you detest, from which [2is separated  1your soul] from them.

29. And they shall deal with you in hatred, and they shall take all the things of your toils, and you will be naked and disgraced. And [4shall be uncovered 1the 2shame  3of your harlotry], even  your impiety, and  your harlotry.

30. He did to you these things in  your fornicating after the nations, and you defiled yourself in  their ideas.

31. [2in 3the 4way  5of your sister 1You went]; and I will put  her cup into  your hands.

32. Thus says Adonai the lord; The cup  of your sister you shall drink --  deep and  spacious; it shall be for laughter and sneering  abounding  to complete intoxication.

33. And [2of feebleness 1you shall be filled]; a cup of extinction, and a cup of your sister Samaria.

34. And you shall drink it and strain it out. And  his potsherds you shall devour, and  [2your breasts 1you shall pull about]. And  your holiday feasts, and  your new moons I will pervert, for I have spoken, says Adonai the lord.

35. On account of this, Thus says Adonai the lord; Because you forgot me, and threw me behind  your body, then you receive  for your impiety and  your harlotry! 

36.  Judgment against Aholah and Aholibah And the lord said to me, O son of man, Will you judge  Aholah and  Aholibah? for you shall report to them  their lawless deeds.

37. For they committed adultery, and blood is on  their hands; even  with their thoughts they committed adultery. And  their children which they bore to me, [2led them 1they] through fire.

38. While also they did these things to me, they defiled  my holy things in  that day, and  [2my Sabbaths 1they profaned].

39. even in  their slaying  their children to their idols, and entering into  my holy places in  that day  to profane them. And behold, thus they did in the midst  of my house.

40. And they sent forth to the men, to the ones having come from far off, to which [2messengers 1they sent out] to them. And together  in their coming straight you bathed and tinged [2with antimony  1your eyes], and adorned yourself with ornamentation,

41. and you sat down upon a bed being a spread out, and a table being adorned before it; and  my incense and  my oil you put before them, and they were glad in them.

42. And a sound of harmony they played music to men from out of a multitude of men having come being drunk from out of the wilderness. And they put bracelets upon  their hands, and a crown of boasting upon  their heads.

43. And I said, [2not 4with 5these 1Do they 3commit adultery]? And works of a harlot also she fornicated?

44. And they entered unto her. In which manner men enter to a woman harlot, so they entered to Aholah, and to Aholibah the [2women  1lawless],  to commit lawlessness.

45. And [3men 2just 1they are], and they shall punish them in punishment of adulteresses. And in judgment they shed blood, for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.

46. Thus says Adonai the lord; Lead [2against 3them 1a multitude], and put [4among 5them 1disturbance 2and 3ravaging];

47. and let them stone with stones of multitudes, and let them pierce them through with  their swords! Their sons and their daughters they shall kill, and  their houses they shall burn.

48. And I will return the impiety of the land, and [4shall be corrected 1all 2the 3women], and in no way shall they do according to  their impious deeds.

49. And [2shall be imputed  1your impiety] upon you, and the sins  of your ideas you shall bear, and you shall know that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 24

1.  Parable of the Kettle And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me in the [2year  1ninth], in the [2month  1tenth], tenth of the month, saying,

2. O son of man, write for yourself the name of the day from  this day, from which [3fastened 1the king 2of Babylon] upon Jerusalem, even from  [2day  1today's]!

3. And speak [2against 3the 5house  4rebelling 1a parable]! And you shall say to them, Thus says Adonai the lord; Set up the kettle! Set up and pour [2into 3it 1water]!

4. And put into it  its pieces! every [2piece 1good] -- the leg, and shoulder, tearing off the flesh from the bones,

5. [2from 3choice 4cattle 1having taken], then fire up the bones underneath them; boiled erupted and cooked are her bones in her midst.

6. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; O city of bloodshed, a kettle in which there is poison in it, and the poison did not come forth out of her; [2by 3her limb 1they brought forth]; [2fell not 3unto 4her 1a lot].

7. For her blood [2in 3her midst 1became]; upon a smooth rock I arranged it; I have not poured it upon the ground  to cover [2upon 3it 1earth].

8. But to let [2ascend 1rage] for a punishment, to be punished I put  her blood upon a smooth rock, so as to not cover it.

9. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Woe, O city  of blood, I also shall magnify the firebrand,

10. and I will multiply the wood, and kindle the fire, so that [3should melt away 1the 2meats], and [3should be lessened 1the 2broth], and the bones shall be parched;

11. and it should stand upon  her coals, so that it should be burnt through and [2should be heated  1her brass utensils], and [2should melt away 3in 4the midst 5of her 1her uncleanness], and [2should fail  1her poison],

12. and in no way shall there come forth from out of her much  of her poison.

13. [2shall be a disgrace  1Her poison] in the [2of your uncleanness 1boiling], and because you were defiled yourself, and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness, then what if you should not be cleansed any more until of which time I shall fill up  my rage in you?

14. I the lord have spoken, and it shall come, and I will do; I will not warn nor show mercy, and in no way will I comfort; according to  your ways, and according to  your thoughts I will judge you, says Adonai the lord. 

15.  Portent of Mourning And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

16. O son of man, behold, I take from you the desirable things  of your eyes in battle array; but in no way shall you beat your chest, nor in any way shall you weep, nor in any way should [2come 3to you 1tears].

17. You shall moan being silent; [2a moaning 3of bloodshed 4of a loin 1it is]; [3for mankind 2a mourning 1you shall not make]. [3shall not be 1The 2hair on your head] braided upon you, and  your sandals shall be on  your feet; and in no way shall you be comforted by their lips, and the bread of men in no way shall you eat. 

18.  Death of Ezekiel's Wife And I spoke to the people in the morning, in which manner he gave charge to me. And [2died  1my wife] at evening. And I did in the morning in which manner orders were given to me.

19. And [3said 4to 5me 1the 2people], Will you not report to us what these things are which you do?

20. And I said to them, The word of the lord came to me, saying,

21. Say to the house  of Israel! Thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I will profane  my holy places, the neighing of your strength, the desirable things of your eyes, and for what [2spare  1your souls]; and  your sons and  your daughters whom you abandoned [2by 3the broadsword 1will fall].

22. And you shall do in which manner I have done. From their mouth you shall not be comforted, and the bread of men you shall not eat.

23. And  your hair shall be upon  your head, and  your sandals on  your feet; neither shall you lament, nor shall you weep; and you shall melt away in  your iniquities, and [2shall comfort 1each]  his brother.

24. And Ezekiel will be to you for a portent; and according to all as many things as he did you shall do. Whenever these things should come, then you shall realize that I am the lord.

25. And you, O son of man, shall it not be in the day whenever I take  their strength from them, the haughtiness  of their boasting, the desirable things  of their eyes, and the haughtiness  of their soul, their sons, and their daughters,

26. that in  that day [3shall come 1the one 2escaping] to you,  to announce to you in  your ears?

27. In  that day [2shall be opened wide  1your mouth] to the one having escaped, and you shall speak, and in no way shall you be mute any longer. And you will be to them for a portent; and they shall realize that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 25

1.  The Prophecy against Ammon And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, firmly fix  your face against the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them!

3. And you shall say to the sons of Ammon, Hear the word of Adonai the lord! Thus says Adonai the lord; Because you rejoiced over  my holy places, for it was profaned; and over the land  of Israel, for it was obliterated; and over the house  of Judah, for they went into captivity.

4. On account of this, behold, I deliver you up to the sons of Kedem for an inheritance. And they shall encamp among  your chattel among you; and they shall put [2among 3you  1their tents]; they shall eat  your fruits, and they shall drink  of your fatness.

5. And I will give the city  of Ammon for pastures of camels, and the sons of Ammon for a pasture of sheep. And you shall realize that I am the lord.

6. For thus says the lord; Because you clapped  your hand, and stamped  your foot, and rejoiced in your soul over the land  of Israel;

7. on account of this, behold, I will stretch out  my hand against you, and I will appoint you for ravaging among the nations; and I will utterly destroy you from out of the peoples, and I will destroy you from out of the regions by destruction; and you shall realize that I am the lord. 

8.  Judgment against Moab Thus says Adonai the lord; Because [4said 1Moab 2and 3Seir], Behold, in the manner of all the nations is the house Judah.

9. On account of this, behold, I will disable the shoulder of Moab from the cities of his extremities, the choice land, the house of Beth-jeshimoth above the spring of the city by the sea.

10. Of the sons of Kedem [3in addition to 4the 5sons 6of Ammon 1I have given 2them] for an inheritance, so that there should not be a memory of the sons of Ammon among the nations.

11. And in Moab I will execute vengeance, and they shall realize that I am the lord. 

12.  Judgment against Edom Thus says Adonai the lord; Because Edom did in  their avenging with vengeance against the house of Judah, and resented them, and took vengeance for punishment upon them;

13. on account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Even I will stretch out  my hand against  Edom. And I will utterly destroy from her man and beast. And I will make it desolate. And from out of Teman and of Ledan the ones being pursued [2by 3the broadsword 1shall fall].

14. And I will execute  my vengeance against  Edom by the hand of my people Israel. And they shall deal with  Edom according to  my anger, and according to  my rage. And they shall recognize  my vengeance, says Adonai the lord. 

15.  Judgment against the Philistines On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Because [3did 1the 2Philistines] with vengeance, and raised up vengeance rejoicing from their soul  to wipe them away unto the eon.

16. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I shall stretch out  my hand against the Philistines. And will utterly destroy the Cherethim, and I will destroy the ones remaining, the ones dwelling  on the coast.

17. And I will execute among them [2vengeance 1great] in rebukes of rage, and they shall realize that I am Adonai the lord in the executing  of my vengeance upon them.  

## Ezekiel 26

1.  Judgment against Sor And it took place in the eleventh year, day one of the month, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, because Sor said against Jerusalem, Well done, she was broken; she had destroyed the nations; she was turned to me -- she that was full was made desolate.

3. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I am against you, O Sor, and I will lead against you [2nations 1many] as [3ascends 1the 2sea] with her waves.

4. And they shall throw down the walls of Sor; and they shall throw down  your towers; and I will winnow  her dust from her, and I will make her into a smooth rock.

5. [2for a refreshing 3of dragnets 1She will be] in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken, says Adonai the lord, and she will be for plunder to the nations.

6. And  her daughters in the plain [2by sword 1shall be done away with]; and they shall know that I am the lord.

7. For thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I bring against you, O Sor,  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the north ([2king 3of kings 1he is]) with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and a gathering [2nations 1of many], exceedingly.

8. This one  [2your daughters  3in 4the 5plain 6by the sword 1will do away with]; and he will appoint against you an advance guard, and he will enclose you, and he will put [2around 3you 1a trench], and he will enclose upon you with a siege mound round about, and a surrounding of shields, and  [2his lances 3before 4you 1he shall appoint].

9.  [2your walls 3and  4your towers 1He will demolish] with  his own weapons.

10. From the multitude  of his horses [2shall cover you  1their dust]; and from the sound  of his horsemen and the wheels  of his chariots [2shall be shaken  1your walls] at his entering  your gates, as one entering into a city from the plain.

11. With the hoofs  of his horses they shall trample all  your squares;  [2your people 3by sword 1they shall do away with]; and the support  of your strength [2to 3the 4ground 1they shall bring down].

12. And he shall plunder  your force, and shall despoil  your possessions, and shall throw down  your walls, and  [4houses 2your  3desirable 1shall demolish]. And  your stones, and  your wood, and  your dust [2into 3the midst 4of the 5sea 1he will cast].

13. And he will rest up the multitude  of your musicians. And the sound  of your psalteries in no way shall be heard any longer.

14. And I will make you for a smooth rock. [2a place for freshening 3dragnets 1You will be]. In no way shall you be rebuilt any more; for I the lord spoke, says Adonai the lord.

15. For thus says the lord to Sor, Shall not at the sound  of your downfall in the moaning of the wounded in the unsheathing of the sword in your midst [3shake 1the 2islands]?

16. And [6shall go down 7from  8their thrones 1all 2the 3rulers 4of the 5sea], and they shall remove  their mitres, and  [4clothes 2their  3colored 1they shall take off]. [2by a change of state 1They shall be startled] upon the earth. They shall be seated and shall fear  their destruction, and they shall moan over you.

17. And they shall take [2over 3you 1a lamentation], and shall say to you, O how you were destroyed and deposed from the sea, O [2city  1praiseworthy], who was strong in  her sea, and the ones inhabiting her, the one putting  her fear in all  her inhabitants.

18. And [3shall fear 1the 2islands] from the day of your downfall; and [3shall be disturbed 1the 2islands] in the sea from  your expedition.

19. For thus says the Lord the lord; Whenever I should appoint you a city for being made desolate, as the cities  not being dwelt in,  in my leading [3upon 4you 1the 2deep], and [3shall cover 4you up 2water 1much],

20. that I will bring you down to the ones having gone down into the pit, to the people of the eon. And I shall settle you into the depths of the earth, as [2desolation 1an eternal] with ones going down into the pit, so that you should not be inhabited upon the land of life.

21. [2you for destruction 1I will appoint], and you shall not exist any longer. And you shall seek and not find into the eon, says Adonai the lord.  

## Ezekiel 27

1.  A Lamentation against Sor And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. And you, O son of man, take [2against 3Sor 1a lamentation].

3. And you shall say  to Sor, to the one dwelling upon the entrance of the sea, to the market-place of the peoples from [2islands 1many], Thus says Adonai the lord  to Sor, You said, I invested myself with my beauty.

4. In the heart of the sea  are your borders, your sons invested to you beauty.

5. Cedar of Senir was used to build by you; they used fascia planks of cypress from  Lebanon; [2was taken  3to make 4masts for you 1fir].

6. From out of  Bashan they made  your oars;  [2your temples 1they made] from out of ivory; houses of the woods from the islands of the Chittim.

7. Linen with embroidery from out of Egypt was to you for a strewn bed,  to put [2upon 3you 1glory], and to clothe you in blue and purple from the islands of Elishah; and they became your wraps.

8. And  your rulers, the ones dwelling in Sidon, and Arvad became your oarsmen.  Your wise men, O Sor, the ones who were among you, these were your navigators.

9. The elders of the Biblians, and  their wise men who were among you, these grew in strength  for your counsel. And all the boats of the sea and  their oarsmen came to you from the descent of the west.

10. Persians and Lidians and Libyans were [2among  3your force 1men], of your warriors -- [2shields 3and 4helmets 1they hung] among you; these gave  you glory.

11. Sons of Arvad, and  your force were upon  your walls round about. But also Medes in  your towers were guards.  [2their quivers 1They hung] upon  your moorings, round about these they perfected your  beauty.

12. Carthaginians were your merchants because of the abundance of all your strength. Silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, and tin, and lead they put in your market.

13. The Greek and the whole world, and the places extending; these traded with you in lives of men; and items of brass they gave  for your trade.

14. From out of the house of Torgarmah, horses and horsemen and mules they gave for your market.

15. The sons of the Rhodians were your merchants; from the islands they multiplied  your trade, even teeth of ivory; and to the ones bringing you repaid  with your wages,

16. of men for your trading from the multitude  of your consolidation; balsam and purple and linen, and colored works from out of Tharsis; and Ramoth and Chohor gave  for your market.

17. Judah, and the sons of Israel, these were your merchants in the sale of grain and perfumed liquids; and foremost honey and olive oil and balm they gave unto  your consolidation.

18. Damascus was your trade in the abundance of your works, from an abundance of your power; wine from Helbon, and [2wool 1shining] from Miletus.

19. Dan and Javan and Moozel were for  your market; iron for working implements and wheels [2among  3your consolidation 1are].

20. Dedan were your merchants with [2animals 1choice] for chariots.

21.  Arabia and all the rulers of Kedar, these were your merchants trading [2through 3your hand 1camels], and lambs, and rams in which they traded with you.

22.  Your merchants were Sheba and Raamah, these were your merchants with foremost of spices, and [2stones 1precious]; and [2gold 1they gave]  for your market.

23. Haran and Canneh and Eden, these were your merchants; Sheba and Assyria and Chilmad were your merchants;

24. bringing trade of blue, and [2treasures 1choice] being bound in rough cords, and cypress.

25. Boats among them  were your merchants in the abundance  of your consolidations. And you were filled up and weighed down exceedingly in the heart of the seas.

26. [4into 6water 5much 2led 3you  1Your oarsmen]; the wind of the south broke you in the heart of the sea.

27.  Your force, and  your wage, and  your consolidations, and  your oarsmen, and  your navigators, and  your counselors, and  your consolidations from out of  your consolidations, and all the men,  your warriors  among you; and [2whole 3gathering 1your] in the midst of you shall fall in the heart of the sea in the day  of your downfall.

28. At the sound  of your cry  your navigators [2with fear 1shall be afraid].

29. And [3shall go down 4from  5their boats 1all  2your oarsmen], and the crewmen, and the captains of the sea; [2upon 3the 4ground 1they shall stand].

30. And they shall shout over you  with their voice, and shall cry out bitterly, and shall place earth upon  their head, and [2of ashes 1shall spread a bed].

31. And they shall shave because of you unto baldness; and they shall gird on sackcloth, and shall weep over you in bitterness of life, even lamenting bitterly.

32. [2shall take  1Their sons 4over 5you 3a lamentation] and a wailing, Sor, Who is as Tyre observing silence in the middle of the sea?

33. How much [2did you find 1wage] from the sea? You filled up nations from  your abundance, and from  your consolidation you enriched all the kings of the earth.

34. But now you are broken in the sea; [5is in 6the depth 7of the water  1your consolidation 2and 3all  4your gathering] in your midst. [3fell 1All  2your oarsmen].

35. All the ones dwelling the islands shall be gloomy over you, and  their kings [2with a change of state 1shall be amazed], and [2shall burst into tears  1their countenance].

36. Merchants from the nations whistled at you; [2for destruction 1you became], and no longer will you be into the eon.  

## Ezekiel 28

1.  To the Ruler of Tyre And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. And you, O son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre! Thus says Adonai the lord; because [2was raised up high  1your heart], and you said, [3the 4God 2am 1I], [2the dwelling 3of God 1I inhabited] in the heart of the sea. But you are a man, and not God, and you made  your heart as the heart of God.

3.  [3wiser than 1Are 2you]  Daniel, or [2the wise 1did not] correct you with their higher knowledge?

4. Is it by  your higher knowledge, or in  your intelligence you produced for yourself power, and you procured gold and silver among  your treasures?

5. Or by  [2much 3higher knowledge 1your] and in your trade did you multiply your power, and raise up high  your heart by  your power?

6. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Since you imputed  your heart as the heart of God;

7. for this, behold, I bring upon you strange pestilent ones from the nations. And they shall empty out  their swords against you; against the beauty  of your higher knowledge; and they shall spread  your beauty unto destruction.

8. And they shall bring you down, and you shall die by death of the slain in the heart of the sea.

9. In saying, will you say, [3God 2am 1I], in the presence of the ones doing away with you?  But you are a man, and not God in the hand of ones piercing you.

10. In deaths of the uncircumcised you shall die by the hands of strangers; for I spoke, says Adonai the lord. 

11.  A Lamentaion Over the Ruler of Tyre And came the word of the lord to me, saying,

12. O son of man, take a lamentation over the ruler of Tyre, and say to him! Thus says Adonai the lord; You are a seal of likeness full of wisdom, and a crown of beauty.

13. [2in 3the 4luxury  5of the paradise  6of God 1You were]; [2every 4stone 3precious 1you bound on] -- sardius, and topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and amber, and agate, and amethyst, and chrysolite, and beryl, and onyx. And with gold you filled up  your treasuries and  your storehouses among you.

14. From which day you were created and were carefully prepared with the cherub being anointed by God, and  encamping in the tent, even I put you on [2mount 1the holy] of God; you existed among the midst of the stones of fire.

15. You were unblemished in  your days of which day you were created, until of which time [3were found 1the 2offences] in you.

16. From the abundance  of your trade you filled  your storerooms with lawlessness, and sinned. And you were wounded from the mountain  of God, and [4led 5you 1the 2cherub  3overshadowing] from out of the midst of the stones of fire.

17. [2was raised up high  1Your heart] over  your beauty; [2was corrupted  1your higher knowledge] with  your beauty because of the multitude  of your sins. [3upon 4the 5earth 1I tossed 2you]; [3before 4kings 1I put 2you] to be made an example.

18. Because of the multitude  of your sins and the iniquities  of your trade you profaned  your temples; and I will lead fire from out of your midst, this shall devour you; and I will put you for ashes upon the earth before all the ones seeing you.

19. And all the ones knowing you among the nations shall be gloomy over you; [2for destruction 1you became], and you shall not exist any longer into the eon. 

20.  Judgment against Sidon And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

21. O son of man, firmly fix  your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it!

22. And say! Thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I am against you Sidon; and I shall be glorified in you. And you shall know that I am the lord, in  my executing [2among 3you 1judgments]; and I shall be sanctified among you.

23. And I shall send out against you death and blood in  your squares; and there shall fall men being wounded by swords among you, surrounding you; and they shall know that I am the lord.

24. And there will not be any longer in the house of Israel a barb of bitterness, nor a thorn of grief from all the ones surrounding them, of the ones dishonoring them; and they shall know that I am Adonai the lord.

25. Thus says Adonai the lord; And I will gather the house of Israel from out of the nations of which they were dispersed there. And I will be sanctified among them before the peoples, and the nations. And they shall dwell upon  their land which I gave to my servant Jacob.

26. And they shall dwell upon it in hope. And they shall build houses, and shall plant vineyards, and shall dwell in hope, whenever I execute judgment on all the ones dishonoring them, among the ones round about them; and they shall know that I am the lord  their God, and the God  of their fathers.  

## Ezekiel 29

1.  A Prophecy against Egypt In the [2year  1tenth], in the tenth month, day one of the month, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me saying,

2. O son of man, firmly fix  your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against entire Egypt!

3. Speak and say! Thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I am against you, O Pharaoh king of Egypt, the [2dragon  1great], the one lying in wait in the midst  of his rivers. The one saying, [3are mine 1The 2rivers], and I made them.

4. And I will put snares into  your jaws, and I will cleave the fishes  of your river to  your wings. And I will lead you from out of the midst  of your river, and all the fishes of the river [2to 3your scales 1I will cleave].

5. And I will throw you down  quickly, and all the fishes  of your river. Upon the face of the plain you shall fall, and no way shall you be brought together; and no way shall you be screened. To the wild beasts of the earth, and to the winged creatures of the heaven I have given you for a thing to be devoured.

6. And [5shall know 1all 2the ones 3dwelling 4Egypt] that I am the lord, because you became a rod of reed to the house of Israel.

7. When they took hold of you with their hand, then you were fractured; and when [3prevailed 4against 5them 1every 2hand]. And when they rested upon you, you were broken, and you broke [3of them 2of all 1the loin].

8. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I bring upon you the broadsword; and I will destroy men from you, and beasts.

9. And [4will be 1the 2land 3of Egypt] for destruction and desolation. And they shall know that I am the lord, because of  your saying, The rivers are mine and I made them.

10. On account of this, behold, I am against you, and against all  your rivers. And I will give the land of Egypt unto desolation, broadsword, and destruction, from Migdol and Syene even unto the borders of the Ethiopians.

11. In no way shall there go through by it the foot of a man; and the foot of a beast in no way shall go through it, and it shall not be inhabited forty years.

12. And I will appoint  her land for destruction in the midst of a land being made desolated, and  her cities [2in 3the midst 4of cities 5being made desolated 1shall be] for extinction forty years. And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will winnow them among the places.

13. Thus says Adonai the lord; After forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations of which they were dispersed there.

14. And I will return the captivity of the Egyptians, and I will settle them in the land of Phathros, in the land from where they were taken; and it will be [2rule 1a humble] there,

15. more than all the rules,  it shall be least  to not be raised up high any more over the nations. And [3very few 2them 1I will make], so as for [2to not be 1them] many among the nations.

16. And no longer will they be any more [3to the 4house 5of Israel 1for 2a hope], calling to mind lawlessness in  their following after them. And they shall know that I am Adonai the lord. 

17.  Nebuchadnezzar's Conquest And it came to pass in the seventh and twentieth year, day one of the [2month  1first], came the word of the lord to me, saying,

18. O son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon reduced to slavery  his force [2service 1for a great] against Tyre. Every head was bald and every shoulder loose of hair. And a wage did not exist to him, and  his force was against Tyre, for the service of which they served against it.

19. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I give to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the land of Egypt; and he shall despoil  her spoils, and he shall plunder  her plunder; and it will be the wage  for his force.

20. In return  for his ministration of which he served against Tyre, I have given to him the land of Egypt, because of as much as he worked to me, says Adonai the lord.

21. In  that day there shall rise up a horn to all the house of Israel, and I will give to you a mouth being opened in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 30

1.  Judgment against Egypt and Her Allies And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, Prophesy and say! Thus says Adonai the lord; Oh, Oh the day;

3. for [4is near 1the 2day  3of the lord], even [3approaches 1the day  2of the lord]. [2a day 3of cloud 4and 5a time 6of nations 1It will be].

4. And [2shall come 1a sword] against the Egyptians, and there will be a disturbance in the land of Ethiopia, and they shall fall being slain in Egypt, and they shall take  her abundance, and [2shall be cast down  1her foundations].

5. Persians, and Cretans and Lydians, and Libyans, and Ethiopians, and all the intermixed peoples, and of the sons  of my covenant [2by the  sword 1shall fall] with them.

6. Thus says Adonai the lord; And [4shall fall 1the 2supports 3of Egypt], and [4shall go down 1the 2insolence  3of her strength] from Migdol unto Syene; [2by the sword 1they shall fall] in her, says Adonai the lord.

7. And it shall be made desolate in the midst of places being obliterated; and  her cities [2in 3the midst 4of cities 5being made desolate 1will be].

8. And they shall know that I am the lord, whenever I shall appoint fire against Egypt, and [5shall be broken 1all 2the ones 3helping 4her].

9. In  that day shall come forth messengers hastening to obliterate the hope of Ethiopia; and there will be a disturbance among them in the day of Egypt; for behold, it is come.

10. Thus says Adonai the lord; And I will destroy the multitude of the Egyptians by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;

11. he and  his people with him, the pestilent ones from nations being sent to destroy the land. And they shall all empty out  their swords against Egypt, and shall fill the land with slain.

12. And I will make  their rivers desolate. And I will render the land by the hand of evil ones; and I will obliterate the land, and  its fullness, by the hands of strangers. I the lord have spoken.

13. For thus says the lord  God; And I will destroy the abominations, and I will rest the great ones from Memphis, and the rulers from the land of Egypt, and they will not be any longer. And I will put fear in the land of Egypt.

14. And I will destroy the land of Pathros, and I will put fire upon Tanis, and I will execute punishment in Diospolis.

15. And I will pour out  my rage upon Sin, the strength of Egypt. And I will destroy the multitude of Memphis.

16. And I will appoint fire unto Egypt. And [3with a disturbance 2shall be disturbed  1Sin]. And in Diospolis there will be inundation, and [2shall be dispersed 1waters].

17. Young men of Heliopolis and Bubastum [2by 3the sword 1shall fall], and the women [2into 3captivity 1shall go].

18. And in Tehaphnehes [3shall darken 1the 2day] in  my breaking there the chiefdoms of Egypt. And [4shall perish 5there 1the 2insolence  3of her strength]. And [3her 1a cloud 2shall cover], and  her daughters [2captives 1shall be led].

19. And I will execute judgment on Egypt. And they shall know that I am the lord. 

20.  A Proclamation against Pharaoh And it took place in the eleventh year, in the first month, the seventh of the month, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

21. O son of man, [2the 3arms 4of Pharaoh 5king 6of Egypt 1I broke]; and behold, it was not earnestly beseeched  to give to him healing,  to put upon him a dressing,  to be given strength to take hold of the sword.

22. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break  his arms, the strong, and the ones being broken; and I will throw down  his sword from out of  his hand.

23. And I will scatter Egypt into the nations, and I will winnow them into the places.

24. And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and I will put  my broadsword into  his hand. And he shall bring it upon Egypt, and he shall plunder  her plunder, and he shall despoil  her spoils.

25. And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall; and they shall know that I am the lord, in  [2putting 3the 4broadsword 1my] into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it against the land of Egypt.

26. And I will scatter Egypt into the nations, and I shall winnow them into the places; and they shall know that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 31

1.  Parable of the Trees And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, day one of the month, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude! To whom did you liken yourself in  your haughtiness?

3. Behold, Assyria was a cypress in  Lebanon, and goodly in shoots, and dense in the protection, and high  in size; and [3into 4the midst 5of the clouds 2came  1his top].

4. Water nourished him, the deep made him rise up high; [3the 4rivers 1she 2led] round about  his plants, and  [2her collections of water 1she sent forth] unto all the trees of the field.

5. Because of this, [2was raised up high  1his greatness] over all the trees of the field, and [3were multiplied  2tender branches 1his], and [2were raised up high  1his shoots] over [2water 1much], in  his stretching out.

6. In  his shoots nested all the birds of the heaven, and underneath  his tender branches [6procreated 1all 2the 3wild beasts 4of the 5plain]; in  his shadow dwelt all the multitude of nations.

7. And he became good in  his height because of the multitude  of his tender branches; for [2existed  1his roots] among [2water 1much].

8. And [2cypresses 1such] in the paradise  of God, and the pines were not likened to his shoots; and fir trees were not likened to his branches; every tree in the paradise  of God was not likened to him in  his beauty.

9. Because of the multitude  of his tender branches [3good 1I made 2him] by the multitude  of his tender branches. And [8were jealous of 9him 1the 2trees 3of the 4paradise 5of the 6delicacy  7of God].

10. On account of this, thus says Adonai the lord; Because you became great to greatness, and you put  your top into the midst of clouds; and [2was lifted up  1his heart] unto  his height;

11. even I delivered him up into the hands of the ruler of the nations; and he caused  his destruction.

12. And [2utterly destroyed 3him 1strangers], pestilent ones from the nations. And they threw him down upon the mountains. In all the ravines [2fell  1his tender branches]; and [2were broken  1his trunks] in every plain of the land. And [6went down 7from  8his protection 1all 2the 3peoples 4of the 5nations], and they dashed him.

13. [7upon  8his downfall 6rested 1All 2the 3birds 4of the 5heaven]; and upon  his trunks existed all the wild beasts of the field,

14. so that [7should not 8be exalted 9in  10their greatness 1all 2the 3trees  4by 5the 6water], and do not put  their top into the midst of clouds; and [5stand not 6in  7their height 8against 9him 1all 2the ones 3drinking 4water]. All were given unto death in [2of the earth 1the depth], in the midst of the sons of men going down into the pit.

15. Thus says Adonai the lord; In which day he went down into Hades, [3mourned 4him 1the 2abyss]. And I attended to  her rivers, and restrained the abundance of water. And [2was darkened 3over 4him  1Lebanon]; all the trees of the plains [2by 3him 1were enfeebled].

16. From the sound  of his downfall [3shook 1the 2nations] when I brought him down unto Hades with the ones going down into the pit. And [6comforted 7him 8in 10earth 9lowermost 1all 2the 3trees 4of the 5delicacy], and the chosen ones and the best ones  of Lebanon, all the ones drinking water.

17. For also even they went down with him into Hades with the ones slain by the sword; and  his seed  dwelling under  his protection [2in 3the middle  4of their life 1were destroyed].

18. To whom are you likened in power, and in glory, and in greatness among the trees of the delicacy? Go down with the trees of the delicacy into [2of the earth 1the depth]! [2in 3the midst 4of uncircumcised 1You shall sleep], with ones slain by sword. Thus Pharaoh and all the multitude  of his strength, says Adonai the lord.  

## Ezekiel 32

1.  Lamentation against Pharaoh and Egypt And it took place in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, day one of the month, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt! And you shall say to him, [2to a lion 3of nations 1You were likened], and as a dragon, the one in the sea. And you gored in  your rivers, and disturbed water with your feet, and trampled  your rivers.

3. Thus says Adonai the lord; And I will put [2upon 3you 1my net] by an assembly [2peoples 1of many]; and I will lead you by  my hook.

4. And I will stretch you upon the earth; the plains shall be filled. And I shall set upon you all the birds of the heaven; and I will fill up by you all the wild beasts of all the earth.

5. And I will put  your flesh upon the mountains, and I will fill up ravines of  your blood.

6. And I will water the earth from  your excrement; from  your multitude upon the mountains [2the ravines 1I will fill up] with you.

7. And I will cover up [2in  3your being extinguished 1the heaven], and I will darken  his stars; [2the sun 3by 4a cloud 1I will cover], and the moon -- in no way shall [2appear  1her light].

8. All the things shining light in the heaven shall darken over you, and I will appoint darkness over  your land, says the Lord the lord.

9. And I will provoke to anger the heart of many peoples, whenever I lead you as a captivity into the nations, into a land which you knew not.

10. And [3shall be gloomy 4over 5you 2nations 1many], and  their kings [2by a change of state 1shall be amazed] in the flying  of my broadsword unto their faces, the ones waiting for  their downfall from the day of your downfall.

11. For thus says the Lord the lord; The broadsword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.

12. With swords of giants even I shall throw down  your strength, pestilent ones from all nations. And they shall destroy the insolence of Egypt, and [3shall be broken 1all  2her strength].

13. And I will destroy all  her cattle from [2water 1great]; and in no way shall [3disturb 4it 1a foot 2of man] any more; and the track of cattle in no way shall trample it.

14. Then shall [2be still  1their waters], and  their rivers [2as 3oil 1shall go forth], says Adonai the lord.

15. Whenever I shall give Egypt unto destruction, and [3shall be made desolate 1the 2land] with the fullness of it; whenever I shall scatter all the ones dwelling in it, even they shall know that I am the lord.

16. There is a lamentation and they shall lament it; and the daughters of the nations shall lament it over Egypt; and over all  her strength they shall lament her, says the Lord the lord.

17. And it happened in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth of the month, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me saying, 

18.  Lament over Egypt O son of man, lament over the multitude of Egypt, for [3shall bring 5down 4her 1the 2daughters]; even the nations dead into the depths of the earth, to the ones going down into the pit.

19. From [2waters 1good-looking] descend and sleep with the uncircumcised!

20. Among the midst of ones slain by sword they shall fall with him, and [3shall sleep 1all  2of his strength].

21. And [3shall say 4to you 1the 2giants], into the depth of the pit [2not 3best 1you are]; you go down and sleep with  uncircumcised! in the midst of the ones slain by the sword.

22. There is Assyria and all  his gathering  around  his grave; all slain  having fallen by the sword;

23. the ones given  his graves in the sides of the pit, and [2existed  1his gathering] surrounding  his tomb. All the slain  having fallen by the sword, the ones giving  them fear upon the land of life.

24. There is Elam and all  his force surrounding  his tomb; all the slain  having fallen by the sword, and the ones going down uncircumcised into [2of the earth 1the depth], the ones putting the fear of them upon the land of life; and they took  their torment with the ones going down into the pit.

25. In the midst of the slain.

26. There they put Meshech and Tubal, and all  his strength surrounding  his tomb; all  his slain ones, all the uncircumcised ones, slain ones by the sword, the ones putting  their fear upon the land of life.

27. And they sleep with the giants  having fallen from the eon, the ones who went down into Hades with weapons of warfare; and they put  their swords under  their heads, and [2came  1their lawless deeds] upon  their bones, for they were frightened giants during  their life.

28. And you [2in 3the midst 4of the uncircumcised 1shall be destroyed], and shall sleep with the ones being slain by sword.

29. There is Edom and  her kings, and all the rulers. Assyria, the ones giving  their strength to the wound of the sword; these [2with 3the slain 1sleep], with the ones going down into the pit.

30. There are the rulers of the north, all these, all the commandants of Assyria, the ones going down with the slain, with the fear of them. And in  their strength being ashamed they sleep uncircumcised with ones slain of the sword; and they carry away  their torment with the ones going down into the pit.

31. Those [3shall see 1king 2Pharaoh], and he shall be comforted over all  their strength. Slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all  his force, says the Lord the lord.

32. For I have put the fear of him upon the land of life; yet he shall sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised with ones slain by the sword, even Pharaoh, and all  his multitude, says the Lord the lord.  

## Ezekiel 33

1.  The Watchmen of the House of Israel And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, speak to the sons  of your people, and you shall say to them, The land upon which ever I bring the broadsword, that [5should take 1the 2people 3of the 4land] [2man 1one] from out of them, and put him for themselves as a watchman.

3. And if one should behold the broadsword coming upon the land, and he should trump the trumpet, and should signify to the people,

4. and [3shall hear 1the one 2hearing] the sound of the trumpet, and should not take guard, and [3comes 1the 2broadsword] and overtakes him,  his blood [2upon  3his own head 1shall be].

5. For [2the 3sound 4of the 5trumpet 1hearing] he did not take guard;  his blood [2upon 3him 1shall be]. But this one that guarded  [2his life 1rescued].

6. And the watchman, if he should behold the broadsword coming, and should not signify by the trumpet, and the people should not take guard; and coming, the broadsword should take from out of them a soul, this soul [2on account  3of its 4lawlessness 1is taken], but the blood of the hand of the watchman I will require.

7. And you, O son of man, [3as watchman 1I have appointed 2you] to the house of Israel, and you shall hear [2from out of  3my mouth 1a word], and you shall announce to them from me.

8. And in  my saying to the sinner, To death you shall die; and you should not speak  to guard the impious from  his way, he, the lawless one,  [2of his lawlessness 1shall die],  but his blood [2of  3your hand 1I will require].

9. But you, if you should forewarn the impious  of his way to turn from it, and he should not turn from  his way, this one [2in 3his impiety 1shall die]; but you  [3soul 2your own 1rescued]. 

10.  The Message of Righteousness And you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel! Thus you spoke, saying,  Our delusions and  our lawless deeds [2upon 3us 1are], and in them we melt away, and how then shall we live?

11. Say to them! As I live, says Adonai the lord, I do not want the death of the impious, but as for [3to turn 1the 2impious] from  his way, and [2to live 1for him]. By turning you turn from  [3way 1your  2evil]! For why do you die, O house of Israel?

12. And you O son of man, say to the sons  of your people! The righteousness of the just in no way should rescue him, in which ever day he should wander. And the lawlessness of the impious in no way shall afflict him in which ever day he should turn from  his lawlessness. But the just no way shall be able to be delivered in the day of his sin.

13. In  my saying to the righteous that [2to life 1he shall live]; and this one has relied upon  his righteousness, and should commit lawlessness, all  his righteousness in no way shall be called to mind; in  his iniquity in which he committed, in it he shall die.

14. And in  my saying to the impious, To death you shall be put to death; and he shall turn from  his sin, and shall execute equity and righteousness,

15. and [2collateral 1he should give back], and [2for any seizures 1he should pay back], [2in 3the orders 4of life 1and he should travel],  to not do unjustly; to life he shall live, and in no way shall he die.

16. All  his sins which he sinned in no way shall be called to mind, for [2equity 3and 4righteousness 1he observed]; by them he shall live.

17. And [4shall say 1the 2sons  3of your people], [5is not 6right 1the 2way 3of the 4 lord]; but this,  their way is not right.

18. In the turning of the righteous from  his righteousness, and he should commit lawless deeds, he shall die in them.

19. And in the [3turning  2sinner] from  his lawlessness, and should observe equity and righteousness; by them he shall live.

20. And you said, [4is not 5straight 1The 2way 3of the lord]. [5each 6by  7his ways 1I will judge 2you 3O house 4of Israel]. 

21.  The Fall of Jerusalem And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, the fifth of the month  of our captivity, there came to me  one having escaped from Jerusalem, saying, [3is captured 1the 2city].

22. And the hand of the lord came upon me at evening before he came; and he opened my  mouth as he came to me in the morning; and in opening  my mouth it was not held together any longer.

23. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

24. O son of man, the ones inhabiting the places being made desolate upon the land  of Israel, speaking they say, [3one 2was 1Abraham], and he held down the land; and we, we are many; [4to us 3was given 1the 2land] for a possession.

25. On account of this say to them! Thus says the Lord the lord; [2upon food with 3blood 1Since you chew], and  [2your eyes 1lift] unto  your abominations, and [2blood 1you pour out] -- then [2the 3land 1shall you inherit]?

26. And you stood with  your broadswords, you did loathsome things, and each [2the 3wife  4of his neighbor 1tainted] -- then [2the 3land 1shall you inherit]?

27. Thus say to them! Thus says the Lord the lord; As I live, assuredly the ones in the places being made desolate [2swords 1shall fall by], and the ones upon the face of the plain [2to the 3wild beasts 4of the 5field 1shall be given] for a thing to be devoured, and the ones behind the places being walled, and the ones in the caves [2by plague 1I will kill].

28. And I will make the land a wilderness; and [4shall perish 1the 2insolence  3of her strength]; and [4shall be made desolate 1the 2mountains 3of Israel] on account of there not being anyone traveling through.

29. And they shall know that I am the lord; and I will make  their land wilderness, and it shall be made desolate on account of all  their abominations which they did.

30. And you, O son of man, the sons  of your people, the ones speaking concerning you by the walls and in the gatehouses of the houses, and [2speaks 1each] to his brother, saying, We should come together and should hear the goings forth from the lord.

31. And they come to you as [2going with one another 1a people], and they sit down before you, and they hear  your sayings, but in no way will they do them, for the lie is in  their mouth, and [3after  4their defilements  1their heart 2goes].

32. And should you become to them as the sound [3psaltery 1of a sweet sounding 2well-tuned], and they shall hear your  words, but no way shall they do them.

33. And when ever it should come to pass, they shall say, Behold, it is come; and they shall know that a prophet was in their midst.  

## Ezekiel 34

1.  The Prophecy against the Shepherds of Israel And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, prophesy against the shepherds  of Israel! Prophesy, and say to the shepherds! Thus says the Lord the lord; O shepherds of Israel, shall [3graze 1the 2shepherds] themselves? Do not [4the 5sheep 3graze 1the 2shepherds]?

3. Behold, [2the 3milk 1you devour], and the wool you put around yourselves, and the robust you slay, and  my sheep you do not graze.

4. The ones being weak you strengthen not, and the ill having a sickness you rejuvenated not, and the broken you did not bind up, and the one wandering you did not turn back, and the lost you did not seek after, and the strong you worked in trouble.

5. And [2were scattered  1my sheep] on account of there not being shepherds; and my sheep became for a thing devoured by all the wild beasts of the field.

6. And [2were scattered  1my sheep] in every mountain, and upon every [2hill 1high]; and [2upon 3the face 4of all 5the 6earth 1they were scattered]; and there was not one seeking after them, nor  turning them back.

7. On account of this, O shepherds, hear the word of the lord!

8. As I live, says the Lord the lord, Assuredly instead  [2became  1my sheep] for plunder, and [2became  1my sheep] for a thing to be devoured by all the wild beasts of the plain, because of there not being any shepherds; and [3sought not after 1the 2shepherds]  my sheep; and [3grazed 1the 2shepherds] themselves,  but my sheep they grazed not.

9. On account of this, O shepherds, hear the word of the lord!

10. Thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require  my sheep from out of  their hands. And I will turn them away  to not tend  my sheep, and [3shall not 4graze 6any longer 1the 2shepherds 5them]. And I shall rescue  my sheep from out of  their mouth, and they will not be themselves any longer for a thing devoured. 

11.  The LORD is the True Shepherd For thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I shall seek after  my sheep, and I shall visit them.

12. As if [3seeks 1the 2shepherd]  his flock in the day whenever there might be dimness and cloud in the midst of his sheep having been parted, so shall I seek after  my sheep. And I will drive them away from every place of which they were scattered there, in the day of cloud and dimness.

13. And I will lead them from out of the nations, and I will gather them from the regions, and I will bring them into  their land, and I will graze them upon the mountains of Israel, and in the ravines, and in every dwelling of the land.

14. [3in 5pasture 4good 1I will graze 2them] on the [2mountain  1high] of Israel, and [2will be  1their havens] there. And they shall sleep there, and they shall rest in [2luxury 1good]; and [2in 4pasture 3a plentiful 1they shall graze] upon the mountains of Israel.

15. I will graze  my sheep, and I will rest them. Thus says the Lord the lord.

16. The lost I will seek, and the one wandering I will return, and the one being broken I will bind, and the faltering I will strengthen, and the strong I will guard; and I will graze them with equity.

17. And you, my sheep, thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I separate between sheep and sheep, rams and he-goats.

18. And is it not enough to you that [2the 3good 4pasture 1you fed on], and the rest  of your pasture you trampled with your feet? and the place of water you drank, and the rest with your feet you disturbed?

19. And  my sheep [2the things trampled 3by 4your feet 1fed on]; and [2the 3disturbed 4water 5under  6your feet 1they drank].

20. On account of this, thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I separate between [2sheep 1the strong] and weak.

21. With the sides and  your shoulders you pushed away, and with your horns you gored, and all the faltering you squeezed out, until of which time you thrust them outside!

22. And I will deliver  my sheep, and no way should they be yet for plunder; and I will judge between ram to ram.

23. And I shall raise up for them [2shepherd 1one]; and he will tend them as  my servant David. He will tend them, and he will be their shepherd.

24. And I the lord will be to them for God, and  my servant  David in the midst of them a ruler. I the lord have spoken.

25. And I will ordain with them a covenant of peace. And I will obliterate [2wild beasts 1the ferocious] from the land; and they shall dwell in the wilderness, and shall sleep in the forests.

26. And I will put them surrounding  my mountain; and I will give  rain according to its time -- a rain of blessing.

27. And the trees, the ones in the plain will yield  their fruit, and the earth shall yield  her strength. And they shall dwell upon  their land in a hope of peace. And they shall know that I am the lord in  my breaking the chain  of their yoke; and I will rescue them from out of the hand of the ones reducing them to slavery.

28. And they shall not be any longer for plunder by the nations. And the wild beasts of the land no longer in any way shall eat them. And they shall dwell in hope, and there will not be one frightening them.

29. And I will raise up to them a plant of peace, and no longer shall they be ones being destroyed by hunger upon the land; and in no way they shall bear any longer the scorning of nations.

30. And they shall know that I am the lord  their God with them, and they are my people, O house of Israel, says the Lord the lord.

31. And you are my sheep; even sheep of my pasture -- [2men 1you are], and I am the lord  your God, says the Lord the lord.  

## Ezekiel 35

1.  The Prophecy against Mount Seir And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, turn  your face against mount Seir, and prophesy unto it!

3. And say to it! Thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I am against you mount Seir, and I will stretch out  my hand against you, and I will make you into a wilderness, and you shall be made desolate.

4. And  [2your cities 3desolate 1I will make], and you will be a wilderness, and you shall know that I am the lord.

5. Because  you became [2enemy 1an eternal], and sat in place against the house of Israel with treachery, by the hand of enemies with a sword, in time of iniquity, at the last.

6. On account of this, as I live, says the Lord the lord; Since [2unto 3blood 1you sinned], even blood shall pursue you. And blood you detested, even blood shall pursue you.

7. And I will appoint  mount Seir for a wilderness, and for being made desolate; and I will destroy from it men and beasts.

8. And I will fill up [4of the 5slain 1your hills 2and  3your ravines]; and in all  your plains ones being slain by the sword shall fall among you.

9. [4desolation 3an eternal 1I will establish 2you], and  your cities no way shall be inhabited any longer. And you shall know that I am the lord.

10. On account of  your saying, The two nations, and the two places will be mine, and I shall inherit them, and the lord is there.

11. On account of this, as I live, says the lord; Even I will do to you according to  your hatred, and according to  your zeal which you did in  your detesting them; and I shall be known to you whenever I judge you.

12. And you shall know that I am the lord. I heard the voice  of your blasphemies. That you said, The [2mountains 3of Israel 1wilderness 5to us 4have been given] for a thing to be devoured.

13. And you spoke great words against me with your mouth; and you called out loud against me --  your words I heard.

14. Thus says the lord; In the gladness of all the earth, [3a wilderness 1I will make 2you].

15. As you were glad in the inheritance of the house of Israel, that it was obliterated, thus I shall do you. For you will be a wilderness, O mount Seir, and all  Edom shall be completely consumed. And you shall know that I am the lord  God.  

## Ezekiel 36

1.  The Prophecy against the Mountains of Israel And you, O son of man, prophesy against the mountains of Israel! and say to the mountains of Israel! Hear the word of the lord!

2. Thus says the Lord the lord; Because [3said 4against you 1the 2enemy], Well done, [3desolate places 2the eternal 1for now 5our possession 4became].

3. On account of this, prophesy and say! Thus says the Lord the lord; Because  of you being dishonored, and being detested by the ones round about you,  for you to be for a possession to the rest of the nations, and you ascended [2of discussion 1as a tongue], and a scorn to nations.

4. On account of this, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the lord. Thus says the lord to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the rushing streams, and to the ravines, and to the places being made quite desolate, and being obliterated, and to the cities  being abandoned, and became for plunder and for trampling to the [3being left behind 2nations 1surrounding].

5. On account of this, thus says the Lord the lord; Assuredly by fire of my rage I spoke against the remaining nations, and against  all Edom; for they gave  my land to themselves for a possession with gladness, dishonoring lives,  to obliterate in plunder.

6. On account of this, prophesy over the land  of Israel! and say to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the ravines, and to the groves! Thus says the lord; Behold, I in  my zeal and in  my rage spoke against  your scorning which nations bore to you.

7. On account of this, thus says the Lord the lord; I shall lift  my hand against the nations, the ones surrounding you; these  [2their dishonor 1shall bear].

8. But your [6O mountains 7of Israel  1grape 2and  3your fruit 5shall eat 4my people]; for they are hoping  to come.

9. For behold, I am for you, and I will look upon you, and you shall be worked and sown.

10. And I will multiply upon you men, all the house of Israel to the end. And [3shall be inhabited 1the 2cities], and the place being made desolate shall be built.

11. And I will multiply upon you men and cattle; and they shall be multiplied, and they shall be increased. And I will settle you as the time in your beginning. And [3good 1I will do 2you] as the things prior of you. And you shall know that I am the lord.

12. And I will engender unto you men against  my people Israel; and they shall inherit you, and you will be to them for a possession, and in no way shall you be added still to be made childless of them.

13. Thus says the Lord the lord; Because they said to you, O her devouring men, and [2made childless 3by  4your nation 1you were].

14. On account of this [3men 1no longer 2shall you devour], and  [2your nation 1you shall not make] childless any more, says the Lord the lord.

15. And [3shall not be heard 4any longer 5against 6you 1dishonor 2of nations]. And the scorning of peoples no way shall you bear any more, and  your nation shall not be childless still, says the Lord the lord. 

16.  The House of Israel Punished for Idolatry And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

17. O son of man, the house of Israel dwelt upon  their land, and they defiled it by  their way, and by  their uncleannesses; and according to the uncleanness  of a woman sitting apart was  their way before my face.

18. And I poured out  my rage upon them for the blood of which they poured out upon the land; and in  their abominations they tainted it.

19. And I scattered them into the nations, and winnowed them into the places. According to  their way and according to  their sin I judged them.

20. And they entered unto the nations of which they entered there. And they profaned  [3name 1my  2holy] in the saying of them, [2the people 3of the lord 1These are], and [2from out of  3his land 1they went forth].

21. And I spared them on account of  [3name 1my  2holy], which [3profaned 1the house 2of Israel] among the nations of which they entered there.

22. On account of this, say to the house of Israel! Thus says the Lord the lord; Not to you do I act, O house of Israel, but because of  [3name 1my  2holy] which you profaned among the nations of which you entered there.

23. And I will sanctify  [3name 1my  2great]  being profaned among the nations, which you profaned in the midst of them. And [3shall know 1the 2nations] that I am the lord, says the Lord the lord, in  my being sanctified among you before their eyes.

24. And I will take you from out of the nations, and I will gather you from out of all the lands, and I will bring you into  your land.

25. And I will sprinkle upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all  your uncleannesses; and [3from 4all  5your idols 1I will cleanse 2you]. 

26.  The Promise of a New Heart and Spirit And I will put in you [2heart 1a new], and [3spirit 2a new 1I will put] in you, and I will remove the [2heart  1stone] from  your flesh, and I will give to you a heart of flesh.

27. And  [2my spirit 1I will put] in you, and I shall make it that [2by  3my ordinances 1you shall go], and  [2my judgments 1you shall keep], and you shall observe them.

28. And you shall dwell upon the land which I gave to your fathers; and you will be to me for a people, and I will be to you for God.

29. And I will deliver you from out of all  your uncleannesses. And I will call for the grain, and I will multiply it, and I will not appoint [2unto 3you 1famine].

30. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the produce of the field, so that you should not take still the scorn of famine among the nations.

31. And you shall remember  [3ways 1your  2evil], and  your practices, the ones not good. And you shall loathe in front of them in  your lawless deeds, and for  your abominations.

32. Not for your sakes do I do this, says the Lord the lord, [2made known 1it is 3to you]. Be ashamed and feel remorse for  your ways, O house of Israel!

33. Thus says the Lord the lord; In the day in which I shall cleanse you from out of all your lawless deeds, even I will settle the cities and [2shall be built up 1desolate places].

34. And the land having been obliterated shall be worked; for reason that being obliterated according to the eyes of all traveling by.

35. And they shall say,  That land, the one being obliterated was become as a garden of luxury; and the cities -- the desolate and ones having been obliterated, and having been razed, [2fortified 1they sat].

36. And [3shall know 1the 2nations], as many as might be left behind round about you, that I the lord built up the places having been demolished; and I planted the places having been obliterated. For I the lord spoke, and I will act.

37. Thus says the Lord the lord; Again for this I shall be sought by the house of Israel  to deal with them; I will multiply them -- [2as 3sheep 1men],

38. as [2sheep 1holy], as sheep of Jerusalem in  her holiday feasts; thus [4will be 1the 3cities 2desolate] full of sheep of men. And they shall know that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 37

1.  The Plain of Dry Bones And [3came 4upon 5me 1the hand 2of the lord], and it led me by spirit of the lord, and put me in the midst of the plain, and this was full of bones of humans.

2. And he led me unto them, round about in a circuit. And behold, [2many 1exceedingly] were upon the face of the plain -- [2dry 1exceedingly].

3. And he said to me, O son of man, shall [3live  2bones 1these]? and I said, O Lord, O lord, you know these things.

4. And he said to me, Prophesy over  these bones! and you shall say to them, O [2bones  1dry], hear the word of the lord. 

5.  The Dry Bones Live Thus says the Lord the lord to these bones; Behold, I shall bring into you a spirit of life.

6. And I shall put upon you nerves, and I will lead [2upon 3you 1flesh], and I shall stretch out upon you skin, and I will put my spirit into you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the lord.

7. And I prophesied as he gave charge to me. And came to pass a sound in  my prophesying, and behold, a quake; and came forward the bones to bone to  its joint.

8. And I beheld, and behold, upon them nerves and flesh germinated, and [2ascended 3upon 4them 1skin] above; but [2breath 1there was no] in them.

9. And he said to me, Prophesy over the wind! Prophesy, O son of man, and say to the wind! Thus says the Lord the lord; From out of the four winds, come wind and breathe onto  these dead, and let them live!

10. And I prophesied in so far as he gave charge to me, and [3entered 4into 5them 1the 2wind], and they lived; and they stood upon  their feet, [4gathering 3great 1a very 2exceedingly].

11. And the lord spoke to me, saying, O son of man,  these bones [2all 3the house 4of Israel 1are]. And they say, [4dry 3are  2bones 1Our]; [3is destroyed  2hope 1our]; we are perished.

12. On account of this prophesy and say! Thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I shall open  your tombs, and I shall lead you from out of  your tombs, and I will bring you into the land  of Israel.

13. And you shall know that I am the lord, by  my opening  your graves,  for me to lead you from out of  your graves,  O my people.

14. And I will put my spirit into you, and you shall live. And I will put you upon  your land, and you shall know that I the lord have spoken, and I will act, says the lord. 

15.  The Rejoining of Israel and Judah And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

16. And you, O son of man, take to yourself [2rod 1one], and write upon it,  Judah, and the sons of Israel of the ones set before by him! And [4rod 3a second 1you shall take 2to yourself], and you shall write on it, To Joseph, the rod of Ephraim, and all the sons of Israel, of the ones set before by him.

17. And you shall join them to one another to yourself, [3into 5rod 4one  1to bind 2them]; and they will be in  your hand.

18. And it will be whenever [4shall speak 5to 6you 1the 2sons  3of your people], saying, Will you not report to us what these things are to you?

19. And you shall say to them, Thus says the lord  God; Behold, I shall take the tribe of Joseph, the one through the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, the ones lying near to him, and I will appoint them unto the tribe of Judah, and they shall be for [2rod 1one], and they shall be one in the hand of Judah.

20. And [9shall be 1the 2rods 3upon 4which 5you 6wrote 7upon 8them] in  your hand before them.

21. And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I take all the house of Israel from out of the midst of the nations which they entered there; and I will gather them from all of the ones surrounding them; and I will bring them into the land  of Israel.

22. And I will make them one nation in  my land on the mountains of Israel; and [2ruler 1one] will be for all these for king. And they will not be any longer for two nations, nor shall they be divided any longer into two kingdoms;

23. that they should not be defiled any longer by  their idols, and in  their stumblings, and in all their impieties. And I will rescue them from all  their lawless deeds which they sinned by them, and I will cleanse them. And they will be to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.

24. And  my servant David will be ruler in the midst of them; and there will be [2shepherd 1one] for all. For by  my orders they shall go, and  my judgments they shall keep, and they shall do them.

25. And they shall dwell upon  their land of which I gave to my servant Jacob, of which place [2dwelt 3there  1their fathers]. And they shall dwell upon it, they and  their sons and the sons  of their sons unto the eon; and David  my servant ruling them into the eon.

26. And I will ordain with them a covenant of peace; [3covenant 2an eternal 1it will be] with them. And I will put them and multiply them; and I will put  my holy things in their midst into the eon.

27. And [2will be  1my shelter] among them; and I will be to them God, and they will be my people.

28. And [3shall know 1the 2nations] that I am the lord  sanctifying them, in the being  of my holy things in their midst into the eon.  

## Ezekiel 38

1.  The Nations Gather for War And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to me, saying,

2. O son of man, firmly fix  your face against Gog, and the land  of Magog, ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him!

3. And say! Thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I am against you ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.

4. And I will lead you about, and I will put a bridle into  your jaws. And I will gather you, and all  your force -- horses and horsemen, [2putting on 3chest- plates 1all]; [2gathering 1a great] -- small shields and helmets and swords;

5. Persians, and Ethiopians, and Libyans; all with helmets and small shields.

6. Gomer and all the ones around him; the house  of Togarmah from the extreme north, and all the ones around him; and [2nations 1many] with you.

7. Be prepared! Prepare yourself! you and all  your gathering  being brought together with you. And you will be to me for an advance guard.

8. After [2days 1many more] he shall be prepared, and upon the latter end of years he shall come unto the land  returning from swords being gathered from many nations upon the land of Israel, which was desolate wholly. And this one [2from out of 3nations 1comes forth]; and they shall dwell in peace all together.

9. And you shall ascend as rain, and shall come as a cloud to cover up the land -- and you shall be, and all the ones around you, and [2nations 1many] with you.

10. Thus says the Lord the lord; And it will be in  that day [2will ascend 1things] upon  your heart, and you shall consider [2devices 1wicked].

11. And you shall say, I will ascend upon the land having been thrown away; I will come upon ones being still at rest, and living in peace, all dwelling in a land in which no [2exists 1wall], nor bars, and [2doors 1there are no] among them;

12. to plunder plunder, and to despoil spoils,  to turn my hand against the place having been made desolate which was settled, and against a nation being gathered from many nations, having produced possessions, dwelling upon the navel of the earth.

13. Sheba, and Dedan, and merchants of Carthage, and all  their towns shall say to you, For plunder  [3to plunder 1you 2come], and to despoil spoils. You gathered together your gathering to take silver and gold, to carry away property,  to despoil [2spoils 1great].

14. On account of this, prophesy O son of man, and say  to Gog! Thus says the lord; Will you not in  that day, in the settling  of my people Israel in peace, arise?

15. And you shall come from out of  your place, from the extreme of the north, and [2nations 1many] with you, [2riders 3having horses 1all], [2gathering 1a great], and a great force. 

16.  Gog Shall Ascend against Israel And you shall ascend against  my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land. At the latter end of the days it will be. And I will lead you against  my land, that [4shall know 1all 2the 3nations] me, in  my being sanctified among you before them.

17. Thus says the Lord the lord; O Gog, you are concerning of whom I spoke about [2days  1in former], by the hand  of my servants the prophets  of Israel, the ones prophesying in  those days and years,  to lead you unto them.

18. And it will be in  that day, in the day which ever [2should come  1Gog] against the land of Israel, says the Lord the lord, [2shall ascend  1my rage].

19. And  my zeal in fire  of my anger I spoke. Assuredly, in  that day there will be [2quake 1a great] upon the land of Israel.

20. And [5shall shake 6before 7my face 1the 2fishes 3of the 4sea], and the birds of the heaven, and the wild beasts of the plain, and all the reptiles  crawling upon the earth, and all the men  upon the face of the earth. And [3shall tear 1the 2mountains], and [3shall fall 1the 2ravines], and every wall upon the land shall fall.

21. And I will call upon him every fear, says the lord. The sword of a man [2against  3his brother 1will be].

22. And I will judge him by plague, and blood, and [2rain 1flooding], and stones of hail; and fire and sulphur I will rain upon him, and upon all the ones with him, and upon [2nations 1many] with him.

23. And I will be magnified, and I will be sanctified, and I will be glorified, and I shall be known before many nations, and they shall know that I am the lord.  

## Ezekiel 39

1.  The Prophecy against Gog And you, O son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says the Lord the lord; Behold, I am against you Gog ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal!

2. And I will gather you, and I will lead you down, and I will haul you from the extreme north, and I will lead you upon the mountains of Israel.

3. And I will destroy  your bow from  [3hand 1your  2left], and  your arrows from  [3hand 1your  2right].

4. And I will throw you down upon the mountains of Israel; and you shall fall, you and all the ones around you. And the nations, the ones with you shall be given to a multitude of birds, to every winged creature; and [3to all 4the 5wild beasts 6of the 7plain 1I have given 2you] to be devoured.

5. Upon the face of the plain you shall fall, for I spoke, says the Lord the lord. 

6.  The LORD Sends Fire on Gog And I will send fire upon Magog, and [3shall be inhabited 1the 2islands] in peace. And they shall know that I am the lord.

7. And  [3name 1my  2holy] will be known in the midst of my people Israel; and [4shall not 5be profaned  3name 1my  2holy] any longer. And [3shall know 1the 2nations] that I am the lord, the holy one in Israel.

8. Behold, it is come, and you shall know that it will be, says the Lord the lord; this is the day in which I spoke.

9. And [6shall come forth 1the ones 2dwelling 3the 4cities 5of Israel], and they shall kindle a fire with the weapons -- small shields, and shafts, and bows, and arrows, and rods of the hands, and lances; and they shall kindle with them a fire for seven years.

10. And no way shall they take trees from out of the plain, nor shall they fell trees from out of the groves; but only the weapons shall they incinerate with fire. And they shall plunder the ones plundering them, and shall despoil the ones despoiling them, says the lord.

11. And it will be in  that day I will appoint  Gog a place of renown -- a memorial in Israel, a cemetery of the ones coming by the sea. And they shall enclose the cleft of the ravine, and they shall bury Gog there, and all  his multitude. And it shall be called then, The Cemetery  of Gog.

12. And [3shall bury 4them 1the house 2of Israel], that [3should be cleansed 1the 2land] in seven months.

13. And [6shall bury 7them 1all 2the 3people 4of the 5land]; and it will be to them for a famous place in which day I was glorified, says the Lord the lord.

14. And [2for men 3continually 1they shall give orders] for coming over the land to bury the ones being left upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it. After the seven months, and they shall seek.

15. And every one  traveling over the land, and seeing the bone of a man, shall build [2by 3it 1a sign], until whenever [3shall bury 4it 1the ones 2burying] in the cemetery  of Gog.

16. For even the name of the city is Cemetery; and [3shall be cleansed 1the 2land].

17. And you son of man, thus says the Lord the lord; Speak to every [2bird 1winged], and to all the wild beasts of the plain! saying, Gather together and come! Be gathered together from all the surrounding places unto  my sacrifice! which I sacrificed to you, [2sacrifice 1a great] upon the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat meats, and drink blood.

18. [2meats 3of giants 1You shall eat], and [2blood 3of rulers 4of the 5earth 1you shall drink], rams, and calves, and he-goats, and the calves all growing fat.

19. And you shall eat fat unto fullness, and you shall drink blood unto intoxication from  my sacrifice in which I sacrificed to you.

20. And you shall be filled from  my table -- horse, and rider, and giant, and every male warrior, says the Lord the lord. 

21.  Israel is Restored to the Land And I will put  my glory among you, and [4shall see 1all 2the 3nations]  my judgment which I did, and  my hand which I brought upon them.

22. And [3shall know 1the house 2of Israel] that I am the lord  their God, from  this day and beyond.

23. And [4shall know 1all 2the 3nations] that [4on account of  5their sin 3was captured 1the house 2of Israel], because they annulled covenant against me, and I turned  my face from them, and delivered them into the hands  of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.

24. Because of  their uncleannesses, and because of  their violations of the law I did it to them, and I turned  my face from them.

25. On account of this, thus says the Lord the lord; Now I will return the captivity in Jacob, and I will show mercy on the house of Israel, and I will be jealous on account of  [2name  1my holy].

26. And they shall take  their own dishonor, and the iniquity which they transgressed in  their settling upon  their land in peace, and there will not be one frightening,

27. in  my returning them from out of the nations, and my gathering them from out of the places of the nations; and I shall be sanctified among them before the nations.

28. And they shall know that I am the lord  their God in  my appearing to them among the nations,  in  my gathering them upon  their land. And I shall not abandon them any more -- not one there.

29. And I shall not turn [2any longer  1my face] from them, because I poured out  my rage upon the house of Israel, says the Lord the lord.

4. And he measured the length of the gates -- [2cubits 1twenty], and the breadth -- [2cubits 1twenty] in front of the temple. And he said to me, This is the holy of the holies.

5. And he measured the wall of the house -- [2cubits 1six]; and the breadth of the side -- [2cubits 1four] round about.

6. And the sides, side by side -- thirty and of threes; and a space in the wall of the house at the sides round about,  to be for the ones taking hold to see, so as to thoroughly not touch the walls of the house.

7. And the breadth of the higher of the sides was according to the appendage protruding out of the wall, to the higher one round about the house, so as to flatten out wider above; so that from out of the parts below they should ascend unto the upper rooms, and from out of the middles unto the third stories.

8. And the thraels of the house height round about was a space of the sides equal to the reed [2cubits 1of six] intervals.

9. And the breadth of the wall of the side from outside -- [2cubits 1five]; and the spaces left over between the sides of the house.

10. And between the inner chambers a breadth [2cubits 1of twenty], the circumference of the house round about.

11. And the doors of the inner chambers were unto the space left over of the [2door  1one] of the one towards the north, and the [2door  1one] towards the south; and the breadth of the place  left over -- [2cubits 1five] width round about.

And he measured the length of the place separating in front of the spaces left over of the spaces from behind  that house; and the spaces left over on this side and that side -- [2cubits 1a hundred] length; and the temple, and the corners, and the columned [2porch  1outer] were decorated with fretwork.

16. And the windows were latticed narrow openings round about to the three stories, so as to look through; and the house and the places near were boarded round about, even from the floor unto the windows; and the windows unfolded thrice for looking through.

17. And unto the [2house  1inner] and the outer, and upon the entire  wall round about the inside and the outside,

18. were carved cherubim, and palms between cherub and cherub, two faces to the cherub.

19. The face of a man towards the palm on this side, and the face of a lion towards the palm that side -- [4was carved 1all 2the 3house] round about.

20. From the floor unto fretwork, cherubim and  palms having been carved.

23. And there were two doorways to the temple; and to the holy place two doorways to the two doorways to the turnings;

24. two doorways to the one, and two doorways to the [2door  1second].

25. And a carving was upon them, and upon the doorways of the temple -- cherubim and palms according to the carving of the holy places; and there were seasoned timbers in front of the columned porch outside.

26. And there were [2windows 1hidden]; and he measured on this side and that side unto the roofing of the columned porch; and the sides of the house were joined together.  

## Ezekiel 42

1.  The Priest's Chambers And he brought me into the [2courtyard  1outer], according to the east, opposite of the gate of the one towards the north. And he brought me, and behold, [2inner chambers 1there were five] being next to the space left over, and next to the place separating near the north,

2. [2cubits 1a hundred] in length towards the north, and the breadth [2cubits 1fifty],

3. being diagramed in which manner the gates of the [2courtyard  1inner], and in which manner the peristyles of the [2courtyard  1outer], were being set in rows facing [2stoas 1three rank].

4. And over against the inner chambers was a promenade [2cubits 1ten]  width by [2cubits 1a hundred]  in length, for the inner way [2cubit 1one]; and  their doorways towards the north.

5. And the [2promenades  1upper] were likewise; for [3protruded 1the 2peristyle] from out of it, from out of the [2beneath 1peristyle], and the interval; thus a peristyle and an interval and thus.

6. For they were triple, and [3columns 1they did not 2have] as the columns of the inner chambers; on account of this they protruded from the ones beneath, and the ones in the middle from the ground.

7. And the doorway outside in which manner the inner chambers of the courtyard of the one outside, the ones looking before the inner chambers of the ones towards the north -- [3in length 2cubits 1fifty].

8. For the length of the inner chambers of the ones looking into the [2courtyard  1outer] -- [2cubits 1fifty]; and these are the ones facing these others. The whole [2cubits 1was a hundred].

9. And the doors  of these inner chambers of the entrance of the one towards the east is for one to enter through them from the [2courtyard  1outer]

10. according to the light opening of the one at the beginning of the promenade; and towards the south, and the face of the south according to the face of the space left over, and according to the face of the space separating, and the inner chambers.

11. And the promenade in front of them, was according to the measures of the inner chambers of the ones towards the north; and according to the length of them, and according to the breadth of them, and according to all  their exits, and according to  their lights, and according to  their doorways

12. of the inner chambers of the ones towards the south; according to the doorways at the beginning of the promenade upon a light interval of a reed according to the east of the entering them.

13. And he said to me, The inner chambers, the ones towards the north, and the inner chambers, the ones towards the south, being in front of the intervals, these are the inner chambers of the holy place, in which [6eat 7there 1the 2priests  3approaching 4to 5the lord], the holy things of the holies; and there they shall put the holy things of the holies, and the sacrifice offering, and the things for a sin offering, and the things for an ignorance offering; because the place is holy.

14. There shall not enter there except the priests, and they shall not come forth from out of the holy place into the [2courtyard  1outer], so that [4always 6holy 3might 5be 1the ones 2leading forward]; so that they should not touch  their uniform in which they officiate in them, for it is holy, and they shall put on [2garments 1other] whenever they should touch the people. 

15.  Outer Dimensions of the House And [5was completed 1the 2measurement 3of the 4house] from inside; and he led me out according to the way of the gate  looking according to the east; and he measured the plan of the house round about in arrangement.

16. And he stood at the back of the gate  looking according to the east, and he measured five hundred with the reed  measure.

17. And he turned towards the north and measured in front of the north side [2cubits 1five hundred] with the reed  measure.

18. And he turned towards the west, and he measured in front of the west side, [2cubits 1five hundred] with the reed  measure.

19. And he turned towards the south, and he measured  in front of the south, five hundred with the reed  measure.

20. The four parts of it, and he set in order their enclosure round about -- five hundred towards the east, and five hundred cubits in breadth  to separate between the holy places, and between the area around the wall in arrangement of the house.  

## Ezekiel 43

1.  God's Glory Returns to the House And he led me unto the gate  towards the east, and he led me out.

2. And behold, glory of the God of Israel came according to the way  towards the east. And there was a voice of the camp as [2voice 1the repeating] of many. And the ground shone forth as brightness in the glory round about.

3. And the vision which I beheld was according to the vision which I beheld when I entered  to anoint the city; and the vision of the chariot which I beheld was according to the vision which I beheld upon the river  Chebar, and I fell upon my face.

4. And the glory of the lord entered into the house according to the way of the gate of the one looking according to the east.

5. And [2took me up 1spirit], and brought me into the [2courtyard  1inner]; and behold, [3was full 4of glory 5of the lord 1the 2house].

6. And I stood, and behold, there was a voice from the house speaking to me, and the man stood next to me,

7. and he said to me, You see, O son of man, the place  of my throne, and the place of the track  of my feet, in which [2shall encamp  1my name] in the midst of the house of Israel into the eon. And [3shall not 4profane 7any longer 1the house 2of Israel  6name  5my holy], they and the ones leading them in  their harlotry, and by the murders of the ones leading them in the midst of them;

8. in  their putting  my threshold among  their thresholds, and  my doorways next to  their doorways. And they appointed my wall as holding me [3together 1and 2them]. And they profaned  [2name  1my holy] by  their lawless deeds which they did. And I obliterated them in my rage and by carnage.

9. And now, let [6thrust away  7their harlotry 8and 9the 10murders 1the ones 2leading 3them 4from 5me]! and I will encamp in the midst of them into the eon.

10. And you, O son of man, show to the house of Israel the house, (and they shall abate from  their sins) and the vision of it, and the disposition of it,

11. (and they shall take  their punishment for all of which they did). And you shall diagram the house, and  its preparation, and  its exits, and its entrances, and  its support. And all  its orders, and all  its laws, and all  it rules you shall make known to them. And you shall diagram it before them, and they shall keep all  my ordinances, and all  my orders, and they shall do them.

12. And the diagram of the house upon the top of the mountain, all  its limits round about the holy of holies -- this is the rule of the house. 

13.  Dimensions of the Altar And these are the measures of the altar by cubit of the cubit and a palm; the recess depth a cubit, and a cubit the breadth, and the molding upon the lip round about a span; and this is the height of the altar.

14. From the depth of the beginning  of its hollow part to the atonement-seat, the one from beneath -- [2cubits 1two], and the breadth a cubit; and from the [2atonement-seat  1small] to the [2atonement-seat 1great] -- [2cubits 1four], and the breadth a cubit.

15. And the altar hearth -- [2cubits 1four]; and from the altar hearth and up above the horns, a cubit.

16. And the altar hearth was [2cubits 1twelve] in length by [2cubits 1twelve], four-cornered upon the four parts of it.

17. And the atonement-seat [2cubits 1was fourteen]  in length by [2cubits 1fourteen]  in breadth upon [2four 3parts 1its]; and  its molding encircling it round about -- a half cubit; and  its encircling base was a cubit round about; and  its steps looked according to the east.

18. And he said to me, O son of man, thus says the lord  God; These are the orders for the altar in the day of its being made  to offer upon it whole burnt-offerings, and to pour on it blood.

19. And you shall give to the priests, to the Levites, to the ones from out of the seed of Zadok, to the ones approaching to me, says the lord  God,  to officiate to me, a calf from the oxen for a sin offering.

20. And they shall take from  its blood, and shall place it upon four horns of the altar, and upon the four corners of the atonement-seat, and upon the base round about; and they shall cleanse and atone it.

21. And they shall take the calf, the one for a sin offering, and they shall incinerate it in the place being separated of the house from outside of the holies.

22. And the [2day  1second] you shall take a kid of the goats, unblemished for a sin offering; and they shall atone the altar in so far as they atoned with the calf.

23. And after  completing the making an atonement, they shall bring [2calf 3from out of 4the oxen 1an unblemished], and [2ram 3from out of 4the 5sheep 1an unblemished].

24. And you shall offer them before the lord, and [3shall cast 1the 2priests 5upon 6them 4salt], and they shall offer them as whole burnt-offerings to the lord.

25. Seven days you shall offer a kid for a sin offering each day, and a calf from out of the oxen, and a ram from out of the sheep; [2unblemished 1they shall offer them].

26. Seven days and they shall atone the altar and cleanse it; and they shall fill  their hands.

27. And they shall complete the days. And it will be from the [2day  1eighth] and beyond, and [3shall offer 1the 2priests] upon the altar  your whole burnt-offerings, and the ones  for your deliverance offering; and I will favorably receive you, says the lord  God.  

## Ezekiel 44

1.  The East Gate and the Leader And he returned me by the way of the [2gate 3of the 4holies  1outer], of the one looking according to the east; and this was locked.

2. And the lord said to me,  This gate having been locked will not be opened, and no one will go through it, for the lord  God of Israel will go through it, and it will be locked.

3. For the one leading, this one shall sit down in it  to eat bread before the lord. [2by 3the 4way 5of the columned porch 6of the 7gate 1He shall enter], and according to  its way he shall go forth. 

4.  Entrance to the House And he brought me according to the way of the gate, of the one towards the north over against the house. And I beheld, and behold, [5was full 6of glory 1the 2house 3of the 4 lord], and I fell upon my face.

5. And the lord said to me, O son of man, arrange it upon  your heart, and behold  with your eyes, and  [2with your ears 1hear]! all as much as I [2to 3you 1speak] concerning all the orders of the house of the lord, and all  its laws. And arrange  your heart for the entrance of the house according to all  its exits in all the holy places!

6. And you shall say to the one rebelling, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord the lord; Let it be enough to you from all your lawless deeds, O house of Israel!

7.  for you to bring in sons of foreigners, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh,  to be in  my holy places, and to profane them in  your offering my bread loaves, and fat, and blood; and you violated  my covenant in all  your lawless deeds.

8. And you kept not the orders  of my sanctuary. But you ordered  to keep guards in  my holy places for yourselves.

9. On account of this, thus says the lord  God; All sons of foreigners, with an uncircumcised heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, shall not enter into  my holy places, of all foreigners in the midst of the house of Israel. 

10.  The Laws Governing the Levites Only the Levites who hoped upon me in  [2wandering  1Israel] from me after  [2ideas 1their own], even they shall bear their iniquities;

11. yet they will be among  my holy ones ministering as doorkeepers at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house. These shall slay the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices for the people; and these shall stand before the people  to minister to them.

12. Because they ministered to them before the face  of their idols, and it became to the house of Israel for a punishment of iniquity. Because of this I lifted  my hand against them, says the Lord the lord.

13. And they shall bear  their lawlessness, and they shall not approach unto me  to officiate as priest to me, nor  to lead forward to all the holy things of the holies. And they shall bear their dishonor in the delusion in which they wandered.

14. And I will order them to keep the watches of the house for all  its works, and for all as much as they should do. 

15.  The Sons of Zadok The priests, the Levites, the sons  of Zadok, the ones that kept watches  of my holy things in the [3wandering  1house 2of Israel] from me; these shall lead forward to me  to minister to me; and they shall stand before my face  to offer to me fat and blood, says the Lord the lord.

16. These shall enter into  my holy places, and these shall come forward to  my table  to minister to me, and to guard  my watches.

17. And they shall be in  their entering into the gates of the [2courtyard  1inner] [3apparels 2flaxen linen 1that they shall put on], and they shall not put on wool in  their ministering from the [2gate  1inner] of the courtyard.

18. And [3turbans 2flaxen linen 1they shall have] upon  their heads, and [3pants 2flaxen linen 1shall have] upon  their loins, and they shall not gird with force.

19. And in  their going forth into the [2courtyard  1outer] to the people, they shall take off  their apparels in which they ministered in them. And they shall put them in the inner chambers of the holies, and shall put on [2apparels 1other]; and in no way shall they sanctify the people in  their own apparels.

20. And  their heads they shall not shave, and  their hair they shall not make bare; by covering they shall cover  their heads.

21. And [6wine 1in no way 2shall 5drink 3any 4priest] in  their entering into the [2courtyard  1inner].

22. And [2a widow 3and 4one being cast out 1they shall not take] for themselves for a wife, but only a virgin from out of the seed of the house of Israel; but if there shall be a widow of a priest they shall take her.

23. And  [2my people 1they shall teach] between the holy and the profane; and [3between 4unclean 5and 6clean 1they shall make known 2to them].

24. And [3over 4a judgment 5of blood 1these 2shall attend]  to litigate  my ordinances; they shall do justice, and  [2my judgments 1they shall judge]; and  [2my laws 3and  4my orders 5in 6all  7my holiday feasts 1they shall keep]; and  [2my Sabbaths 1they shall sanctify].

25. And unto a dead soul of a man they shall not enter  to defile themselves; but only unto a father, and unto a mother, and unto a son, and unto a daughter, and unto a brother, and unto his sister who has not become a man's wife shall he be defiled.

26. And after  his being cleansed, [3seven 4days 1he shall count out 2to himself].

27. And whichever day they should enter into the [2courtyard  1inner]  to minister in the holy place, he shall bring an atonement, says the lord  God.

28. And it will be to them for an inheritance -- I am an inheritance to them; and a possession shall not be given to them among the sons of Israel -- I am their possession.

29. And the sacrifices, even the ones for a sin offering, and the ones for an ignorance offering, these they shall eat; and every separation offering in  Israel will be theirs.

30. And the first-fruits of all, and the first-born of all, and [2the 3cut-away portions 1all] from out of all  your first-fruits [2for the 3priests 1shall be]; and  your first produce you shall give to the priest,  to put a blessing upon  your houses.

31. And all decaying flesh, and that taken by wild beasts from the birds and from the cattle [3shall not 4eat 1the 2priests].  

## Ezekiel 45

1.  The Division of the Land And in  your measuring the land for inheritance, you shall separate the first-fruit to the lord, a holy space of the land -- five and twenty thousand in length, and the breadth ten thousand; it will be holy in all  its limits round about.

2. And there shall be from out of this a sanctuary -- five hundred by five hundred four-cornered round about, and fifty cubits shall be their space round about.

3. And from out of this  measurement you shall measure a length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand; and in it will be the sanctuary, the holy of the holies.

4. Being sanctified of the land there shall be a portion to the priests, to the ones ministering in the holy place, and it will be for the ones approaching to minister to the lord. And it will be to them a place for houses being separated  for their sanctification.

5. Twenty and five thousand in length, and a breadth of twenty thousand shall be to the Levites, to the ones ministering in the house, to them for possession cities  to dwell in.

6. And for the possession of the city you shall appoint five thousand for the breadth, and the length five and twenty thousand. In which manner the first-fruit of the holies is to all the house of Israel, so it shall be.

7. And a portion shall be to the one leading from out of this, and from this into the first-fruits of the holies for a possession of the city in front of the first-fruits of the holies, and in front of the possession of the city, the parts towards the west, and from the parts towards the west towards the east. And the length as one of the portions from the limits of the parts towards the west, unto the limits, the parts towards the east of the land.

8. And it will be to him for a possession in  Israel. And [4shall not tyrannize 5any longer 1the ones 2guiding  3my people]; but [4the 5land 3shall inherit 1the house 2of Israel] according to their tribes.

9. Thus says the lord  God; Let it be enough to you, O ones guiding  Israel! [2injustice 3and 4misery 1Let] be removed, and [2equity 3and 4righteousness 1observe]! Lift away the tyrannies from  my people, says the lord  God! 

10.  Weights and Measures [4yoke balance scale 3a just 5and 7measure 6a just 8and 10choenix measure 9a just 1There shall be 2to you] for your measure.

11. And the choenix in like manner will be one  to receive the tenth of the homer, a choenix and a tenth of the homer -- the ephah [3the 4homer 1shall be 2equal to].

12. And the weight twenty oboli five shekels; twenty five shekels, and five and ten shekels [3for the 4mina 1let it be 2to you]. 

13.  The First-fruit And this is the first-fruit which you shall separate; the sixth part of the measure of the homer of the wheat, and the sixth part of the ephah of the cor of the barley.

14. And the order concerning the olive oil -- a cup of olive oil out of ten cups, for the ten cups are a homer.

15. And a sheep from the two hundred sheep as a cut-away portion of all the families of Israel for a sacrifice, and whole burnt-offerings, and for a sacrifice of deliverance offering  to atone for you, says the lord God.

16. And all the people shall give  this first-fruit to the one guiding  Israel.

17. And [4through 5the one 6guiding 3will be 1the 2whole burnt offerings], and the sacrifices, and the libation-offerings in the holidays, and in the new moons, and in the Sabbaths, and in all the holidays of the house of Israel -- he shall offer the sacrifices for sin, and the sacrifice offering, and the whole burnt-offerings, and the offerings  of deliverance  to atone for the house of Israel. 

18.  The Holidays Thus says the lord  God; In the first month, day one of the month, you shall take a calf from out of the oxen, unblemished,  to atone the holy place.

19. And [3shall take 1the 2priest] of the blood, and he shall put it upon the doorposts of the house, and upon the four corners of the temple, and upon the altar, and upon the doorposts of the gate of the [2courtyard  1inner].

20. And so shall you do in the [2month  1seventh], day one of the month, for each senseless and simple one; and you shall atone for the house.

21. And in the first month, the fourteenth of the month; it will be to you the passover holiday -- seven days [2unleavened breads 1you shall eat].

22. And [3shall offer 1the one 2guiding] in that  day for himself, and for all the people of the land, a calf for a sin offering.

23. And seven days of the holiday he shall offer whole burnt-offerings to the lord -- seven calves, and seven rams, unblemished, daily seven days. And for a sin offering a kid of the goats daily; and a sacrifice offering.

24. And [2a cake 3for the 4calf 5and 6a cake 7for the 8ram 1he shall prepare]; and [2of olive oil  1a hin] for the cake.

25. And in the seventh month, the fifteenth of the month, during the holiday, he shall offer according to the same, seven days, and as the sacrifices for the sin offering, and as the whole burnt-offerings, and as the gift offering, and as the olive oil.  

## Ezekiel 46

1.  The Manner of Obeisance Thus says the lord  God; The gate in the [2courtyard  1inner], the one looking towards the east will be locked six days of the operative times; but on the day of the Sabbaths it will be open, and on the day of the new moons it will be open.

2. And [3shall enter 1the one 2guiding] according to the way of the columned porch of the gate outward, and shall stand at the thresholds of the gate; and [3shall offer 1the 2priests] the things of his whole burnt-offerings and the things  of his deliverance offering; and he shall do obeisance upon the threshold of the gate, and he shall come forth; and the gate in no way shall be locked until evening.

3. And [5shall do obeisance 1the 2people 3of the 4land] at the thresholds  of that gate during the Sabbaths and during the new moons before the lord.

4. And [4the 5whole burnt-offerings 3shall offer 1the one 2guiding] to the lord on the day of the Sabbaths -- six [2lambs 1unblemished] and [2ram 1an unblemished];

5. and a gift cake offering for the ram, and for the lambs a sacrifice gift offering of his hand, and [2of olive oil  1a hin] for the cake offering.

6. And in the day of the new moons, [2calf 1an unblemished], and six lambs, and a ram -- they shall be unblemished;

7. and a cake offering for the ram, and a cake offering for the calf will be for a gift offering, and for the lambs, as whatever [2should furnish  1his hand], and [2of olive oil  1a hin] for the cake.

8. And in the entering, the one guiding [2by 3the 4way 5of the 6columned porch 7of the 8gate 1shall enter], and by  its way he shall come forth.

9. And whenever [5should enter 1the 2people 3of the 4land] before the lord during the holidays, the one entering by the way of the gate  towards the north, to do obeisance, shall go forth by the way of the gate  towards the south; and the one entering by the way of the gate  towards the south shall go forth by the way of the gate  towards the north. He shall not return by the gate by which he entered, but straightway from it he shall he go forth.

10. And the one guiding in the midst of them in  their entering shall enter, and in  their going forth, he shall come forth.

11. And in the holidays and in the festivals there shall be the gift cake offering for the calf, and a cake offering for the ram, and for the lambs -- as [2should furnish  1his hand], and of olive oil -- a hin to the cake.

12. And if [3should offer 1the one 2guiding] an acknowledgment offering of a whole burnt-offering of deliverance to the lord, then one should open to him the gate, the one looking according to the east, and he should offer  his whole burnt-offering, and the things  for his deliverance offering, in which manner he did on the day of the Sabbaths. And he shall come forth and lock the doors after  his going forth.

13. And [3lamb 4of a year old 2an unblemished 1he shall offer] for a whole burnt-offering to the lord daily; morning by morning he shall prepare it.

14. And [2a gift offering 1he shall prepare] for it, morning by morning, the sixth  of a measure, and olive oil the third  of a hin  to intermingle with the fine flour as a gift offering to the lord, [2order 1a continual].

15. You shall prepare the lamb, and the gift offering, and the olive oil; you shall offer morning by morning a whole burnt-offering continually. 

16.  Concerning Inheritance Thus says the lord  God; If [3shall give 1the one 2guiding] a gift to one of  his sons out of  his inheritance, this  [2to his sons 1shall be] a possession by inheritance.

17. And if he should give a gift to one  of his servants, then it will be his until the year of the release; and then he shall give back to the one guiding; except the inheritance  of his sons, to them it will be for a possession.

18. And in no way shall [3take 1the 2one guiding] from the inheritance of the people  to tyrannize over them. From out of  his own possession he shall give to inherit to his sons, so that [3should not 4be dispersed  2people 1my] each from out of  his possession. 

19.  Concerning Offerings And he brought me into the way of the one according to the back of the gate, into the inner chamber of the holy places of the priests, the one looking towards the north. And behold, there was a place there having been separated.

20. And he said to me, This  place is of which [3boil 4there 1the 2priests] the sacrifices for an ignorance offering, and the sacrifices for a sin offering; and there they bake the gift offering  thoroughly so as to not bring them forth into the [2courtyard  1outer],  to sanctify the people.

21. And he led me into the [2courtyard  1outer]; and led me around upon the four parts of the courtyard. And behold, there was a courtyard according to each of the sides of the courtyard.

22. Upon the four sides of the courtyard [2courtyards 1were small], [3in length 2cubits 1forty], and a breadth [2cubits 1of thirty] -- [2measure 1one] to the four.

23. And there were inner chambers round about them to the four; and cooking places existed from beneath the inner chambers round about.

24. And he said to me, These are the houses of the cooks of which [5shall boil 6there 1the ones 2ministering 3to the 4house] the things which are offered in sacrifice by the people.  

## Ezekiel 47

1.  The Healing Waters from the House And he brought me unto the thresholds of the house; and behold, water went forth from beneath the open space of the house according to the east, for the front of the house looked according to the east. And the water went down from the south of the house of the right upon the south of the altar.

2. And he led me according to the way of the gate, of the one towards the north; and he led me by the way outside to the gate of the courtyard, of the one looking according to the east; and behold, the water carried down from the [2side  1right].

3. And there was [2exiting 1a man] right opposite there; and a measure was in  his hand; and he measured a thousand.

4. And he went through in the water, the water of release, and he measured a thousand, and he went through the water unto the knees. And he measured a thousand, and he went through the water unto his loin.

5. And he measured a thousand, and he was not able to go through any more, for [3overflowed 1the 2water] as the impetus of a rushing stream of which shall not be passed over.

6. And he said to me, Do you see, O son of man? And he led me, and returned me unto the edge of the river.

7. In  my turning, and behold, upon the edge of the river were [3trees 2many 1exceedingly] on this side and that side.

8. And he said to me,  This water  going forth unto  Galilee, the one towards the east, and goes down unto  Arabia, and comes as far as unto the sea, unto the water of the outlet, and it shall heal the waters.

9. And it will be every life of the living creatures of the ones swarming upon all upon which ever [3should come 4there 1the 2river] shall live. And there will be there [3fishes 2many 1exceedingly]; for [3is come 4there  2water 1this], and it shall heal and shall enliven. Everything upon which ever [3should come 1the 2river] there shall live.

10. And [2shall stand 3there 1fishermen] from En-gedi unto En-eglaim. [2a refreshing 3of dragnets 1It will be for]. [2by 3itself 1It will be], and  its fishes will be as the fishes of the [2sea  1great], [3multitude 2great 1an exceedingly].

11. And in  its outlet, and in  its turning, and in  its overflowing, in no way shall they heal, [2for 3salt 1they have been given].

12. And by the river shall ascend by  its edge on this side and that side every [2tree 1eatable]; in no way shall anything be old upon it, nor shall [2fail  1its fruit] of the newness of it -- it shall put forth first; for  their waters are of the holy place. These waters go forth, and [2will be  1their fruit] for food, and their ascending parts for health. 

13.  The Borders of the Land Thus says the lord  God; These are the borders you shall inherit of the land for the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, an addition of a piece of measured land.

14. And you shall inherit it, each as  his brother in which I lifted  my hand  to give to their fathers; and [3shall fall  2land 1this] to you by inheritance.

15. And these are the borders of the land of the one towards the north, from the [2sea  1great], the way Hethlon of the entrance of Zedad;

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, the places between the limits of Damascus and between the limits of Hamath, the courtyards  of Hatticon, which are upon the limits of Hauran.

17. These are the borders from the sea, from the courtyard  of Enan, the limits of Damascus, and the places towards the north, and the limits of Hamath the places towards the north.

18. And the places towards the east between  Hauran, and between Damascus, and between  Gilead, and between the land  of Israel, the Jordan separates unto the sea the one towards the east of Palm-grove; these are the borders towards the east.

19. And these are the borders towards the south and southwest from Teman, and Palm-grove unto the water of Mariboth Kadesh, reaching forth unto the [2sea  1great] -- this  part is the south and southwest.

20. This  part of the [2sea  1great] defines the bounds unto before the entrance of Hamath, unto its entrance. These are the borders towards the west.

21. And you shall divide  this land to them, to the tribes  of Israel.

22. You shall cast it by lot to yourself, and to the foreigners  sojourning in your midst, whomever engendered sons in your midst. And they will be yours as native-born among the sons  of Israel; with you they shall eat by inheritance in the midst of the tribes  of Israel.

23. And they will be in the tribe of converts among the converts, the ones with them. There you shall give an inheritance to them, says the lord  God.
