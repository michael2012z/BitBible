## Zechariah 1

1.  The Word to Zechariah In the eighth month, [2year 1of the second] unto Darius, came to pass the word of the lord to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

2. The lord was provoked to anger by  your fathers -- [2anger 1a great].

3. And you shall say to them, Thus says the lord of the forces, Turn to me, says the lord of the forces! and I shall be turned towards you, says the lord of the forces.

4. And do not become as  your fathers! ones whom [3accused 4them 1the 2prophets], the ones beforehand saying, Thus says the lord of the forces, Turn from  [3ways 1your  2wicked], and from  [3practices 1your  2wicked]! And they did not listen, and did not take heed  to listen to me, says the lord.

5.  Your fathers, where are they and the prophets, Shall [2into 3the 4eon 1they live]?

6. Furthermore  [2my words 3and  4my laws 1do you receive], as many as I give charge by my spirit to my servants the prophets, the ones overtaking  your fathers? And they answered and said, As [4deployed 1the lord 2of the 3forces]  to do to us according to  our ways, and according to  our practices, so he did to us. 

7.  Vision of the Four Horses On the fourth and twentieth day in the eleventh month, this is the month Shebat, in the second year unto Darius, came to pass the word of the lord to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

8. I saw the night, and behold, a man having mounted [2horse 1a reddish], and this one stood in the midst of the [2mountains  1shady]; and behind him [2horses 1reddish], and white, and spotted.

9. And I said, What are these, O lord? And [3said 4to 5me 1the 2angel], the one speaking to me, I will show to you what these are.

10. And [3answered 1the 2man], the one standing in the midst of the mountains, and he said to me, These are whom the lord sent out to travel about the earth.

11. And they answered to the angel of the lord  standing in the midst the mountains, and they said, We have traveled about the earth, and behold, all the earth is inhabited and tranquil.

12. And [4answered 1the 2angel 3of the lord] and said, O lord of the forces, until when shall you in no way show mercy  on Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, in which you were enraged over this seventieth year?

13. And the lord responded to the angel, the one speaking with me [2sayings 1with good], [2words 1and comforting].

14. And [6said 7to 8me 1the 2angel  3speaking 4with 5me], Shout aloud! saying, Thus says the lord almighty; I am jealous for Jerusalem, and for Zion [2zeal 1with great].

15. And [4anger 3with great 1I 2am provoked] by the nations, the ones joining in making an attack; because I indeed was provoked to anger a little, but they joined in making an attack for evils.

16. On account of this, thus says the lord, I will turn towards Jerusalem for compassion; and  my house shall be rebuilt in it, says the lord of the forces, and a measure shall be stretched out upon Jerusalem.

17. Shout aloud again! saying, Thus says the lord of the of the forces; Yet shall [2be dispersed 1cities] for good things, and the lord shall show mercy still  on Zion, and shall select still  Jerusalem. 

18.  Vision of the Four Horns And I lifted  my eyes, and I looked, and behold, four horns.

19. And I said to the angel, the one speaking with me, What are these, O lord? And he said to me, These are the horns, the ones scattering  Judah, and  Israel, and  Jerusalem.

20. And [2showed 3to me 1the lord] four fabricators.

21. And I said, What are these come to do? And he said to me, saying, These are the horns, the ones having scattered  Judah, and  they broke Israel, and not one of them lifted his head. And these are come forth  to sharpen them in their hands -- the four horns [2nations 1are] lifting up their horn against the land of the lord  to scatter it.  

## Zechariah 2

1.  The Man with a Cord Measure And I lifted  my eyes, and I beheld, and behold, a man, and in  his hand was a measuring line of a surveyor.

2. And I said to him, Where do you go? And he said to me,  To measure out  Jerusalem, and to see how great the width of it is, and how great the length.

3. And behold, the angel  speaking with me stopped, and another angel went forth to meet with him.

4. And he said to him, Run and speak to  that young man! saying, Fruitfully shall Jerusalem be inhabited because of a multitude of men and cattle in the midst of her.

5. And I will be to her, says the lord, a wall of fire round about, and [2for 3glory 1I will be] in the midst of her. 

6.  The Future Glory of Jerusalem Oh, Oh flee from the land of the north! says the lord. For from out of the four winds of the heaven I will gather you, says the lord.

7. Unto Zion escape! O ones dwelling with the daughter of Babylon.

8. Because, thus says the lord almighty, After glory he has sent me out unto the nations, the ones despoiling you; for the one touching you is as  one touching the pupil  of his eye.

9. For behold, I bear  my hand against them, and they will be spoils to the ones serving them. And you shall know that the lord almighty has sent me.

10. Be happy and glad, O daughter of Zion! For behold, I come, and I will encamp in the midst of you, says the lord.

11. And [3shall take refuge 2nations 1many] unto the lord in  that day, and they will be to him for a people. And I will encamp in your midst, and you shall realize that the lord almighty has sent me to you.

12. And the lord shall inherit  Judah  his portion upon the [2land  1holy], and will select still  Jerusalem.

13. Let [3show reverence 1all 2flesh] from in front of the lord; for he was awakened from out of [2clouds 1his holy].  

## Zechariah 3

1.  Clean Garments for the Great Priest And [2showed 3to me 1the lord] Joshua the [2priest  1great] standing in front of the angel of the lord, and the devil standing at the right of him,  being an adversary against him.

2. And the lord said to the devil, May the lord reproach against you, O devil, and may the lord reproach against you, the one choosing  Jerusalem. Is this not a firebrand being pulled out of the fire?

3. And Joshua was being clothed [2garments 1with filthy], and he stood in front of the angel.

4. And the angel responded and said to the ones standing in front of him, saying, Remove the [2garments  1filthy] from him! And he said to him, Behold, I took  your iniquities. And you clothe him in a foot length robe!

5. And he said, Place also a mitre and [2turban 1a clean] upon  his head! And they placed a mitre and [2turban 1a clean] upon  his head. And they put [2around 3him 1garments]. And the angel of the lord stood.

6. And [4testified 1the 2angel 3of the lord] to Joshua, saying,

7. Thus says the lord almighty, If [2in  3my ways 1you should go], and  [2my orders 1should keep guard], then you shall litigate  my house; and you shall guard  my courtyard, and I will give to you ones pacing in the midst  of these standing.

8. Hear indeed, O Joshua the [2priest  1great]! you and  your neighbors, the ones sitting down before in front of you. For [2men 3that are observers of signs 1they are]. For behold, I will bring  my servant -- rising.

9. For the stone which I put before the face of Joshua; upon the [2stone  1one 4seven 5eyes 3are]. Behold, I dig an excavation, says the lord almighty; and I will handle all the injustice of the land in [2day 1one].

10. In  that day, says the lord almighty, you shall call together each  his neighbor underneath a grapevine and underneath a fig-tree.  

## Zechariah 4

1.  The Lamp-stand and the Olive Trees And [6returned 1the 2angel  3speaking 4with 5me]; and he awakened me, in which manner whenever [2should be awakened 1a man] from out of his sleep.

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I have seen, and behold, a lamp-stand [2of gold 1entirely], and the oil lamp bowl upon it, and seven lamps upon it, and seven oil funnels to the seven lamps  upon it,

3. and two olive trees upon it, one at the right  of its oil lamp bowl, and one at the left.

4. And I asked, and I said to the angel, the one speaking with me, saying, What are these, O lord?

5. And [3answered 1the 2angel], the one speaking with me. And he said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, O lord. 

6.  Not by Power, but by My Spirit And he responded and said to me, saying, This is the word of the lord to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by [2power 1great], nor by strength, but by my spirit, says the lord almighty.

7. Who are you  [2mountain  1great] before the face of Zerubbabel  to set up? And I will bring forth the stone of the inheritance [2equaling 3my favor 1of its favor].

8. And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

9. The hands of Zerubbabel laid the foundation  of this house, and  his hands shall complete it; and you shall recognize that the lord almighty has sent me to you.

10. For who treated with contempt [2days 1small]? And they shall rejoice, and shall see the [2stone plummet  1tin] in the hand of Zerubbabel; these seven eyes of the lord are the ones looking upon all the earth.

11. And I responded and said to him, What are  [2two 3olive trees 1these], the ones on the right side of the lamp-stand, and on the left?

12. And I asked of a second time, and I said to him, What are the two branches of the olive trees, the ones by the handles of the two tubes  of gold of the ones pouring and returning back the oil by funnels  of gold?

13. And he spoke to me, saying, Do you know not what these are? And I said, No, O lord.

14. And he said, These are the two sons of fatness, they stand beside the lord of all the earth.  

## Zechariah 5

1.  The Vision of the Flying Sickle And I turned, and I lifted  my eyes, and I saw, and behold, a sickle flying.

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a sickle flying, the length -- [2cubits 1twenty], and the width -- [2cubits 1ten].

3. And he said to me, This is the curse, the one going forth upon the face of all the earth; for every  thief of this one side [2unto 3death 1shall be punished], and every  perjurer of this other side [2unto 3death 1shall be punished].

4. And I will bring it forth, says the lord almighty, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of the one swearing an oath  by my name for a lie; and it shall rest in the midst  of his house, and it shall finish it off entirely, even  its wood and  its stones. 

5.  The Measure Basket and the Woman And came forth the angel, the one speaking to me, and he said to me, Look up  with your eyes, and behold what  this going forth is!

6. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the measure basket  going forth. And he said, This is  their iniquity in all the earth.

7. And behold, a talent of lead was being lifted away; and behold, [2woman 1one] sat down in the midst of the measure basket.

8. And he said, This is  lawlessness. And he tossed it into the midst of the measure basket, and he tossed the stone  of lead into  her mouth.

9. And I lifted  my eyes, and I saw, and behold, two women going forth, and the wind was in  their wings, and these had wings as wings of the hoopoe bird; and they took up the measure basket between the earth and the heaven.

10. And I said to the angel, the one speaking with me, Where are these carrying the measure basket?

11. And he said to me, They build for it a house in the land of Babylon, and to prepare. And they shall put it there upon  its preparation place.  

## Zechariah 6

1.  Vision of the Four Chariots and Horses And I turned, and lifted  my eyes; and I beheld, and behold, four chariots going forth from out of the midst of two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.

2. With the [2chariot  1first 4horses 3reddish]; and with the [2chariot  1second 4horses 3black];

3. and with the [2chariot  1third 4horses 3white]; and with the [2chariot  1fourth 4horses 3spotted] and dapple-gray.

4. And I answered and said to the angel, the one speaking with me, What are these, O lord?

5. And [3answered 1the 2angel], the one speaking with me. And he said, These are the four winds of the heaven, and they go forth to stand beside the Lord of all the earth,

6. with which were [3horses 1the 2black] -- they went forth upon the land of the north; and the white -- they went forth after them; and the spotted -- they went forth upon the land of the south,

7. and dapple-gray -- they went forth, and they looked  to travel about the earth. And he said, Go and travel about the earth! And they traveled about the earth.

8. And he yelled out and spoke to me, saying Behold, the ones going forth upon the land of the north caused rest  for my rage in the land of the north.

9. And came to pass the word of the lord to me, saying,

10. Take the ones of the captivity from the rulers, and from  its profitable ones, and from the ones recognizing it! And you shall enter in  that day, into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, the one having come from out of Babylon. 

11.  A Crown for Joshua the Priest And you shall take silver and gold, and you shall make crowns, and you shall place upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech the [2priest  1great].

12. And you shall say to him, Thus says the lord almighty, Behold, a male, Rising is his name; and from beneath him he shall rise and shall build the house of the lord.

13. And he shall receive virtue, and shall sit and rule upon  his throne; and there shall be a priest at his right. And [2counsel 1peaceable] will be between both.

14. But the crown will be to the ones waiting, and to the ones profitable of her, and to the ones recognizing her, and for the favor of the son of Zephaniah, and for a psalm in the house of the lord.

15. And the ones far from them shall come, and they shall build in the house of the lord. And you shall know that the lord almighty has sent me to you; and it will be as if ones listening should have listened to the voice of the lord  your God.  

## Zechariah 7

1.  Obedience is Better than Fasting And it came to pass in the fourth year of Darius the king, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Zechariah the fourth of the [2month  1ninth], which is Chisleu.

2. And [2sent 3to 4Beth-el 1Sherezar], and Regem the king, and  his men, to atone the lord,

3. saying to the priests  in the house of the lord almighty, and to the prophets, saying, [3has entered 4here 5in 6the 7fifth 8month 1The 2sanctified offering], as it did already a fit number of years.

4. And came to pass the word of the lord of the forces to me, saying,

5. Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, If you should fast or beat your chest in the fifth or in the seventh months, and behold, for seventy years, by fasting have you fasted to me?

6. And if you should eat or should drink, do you not eat and drink to yourselves?

7. [2not 3these  4my words 1Are], which the lord spoke by the hands of the prophets, of the ones before, when Jerusalem was inhabited, and prospering? and  her cities round about, and the mountainous area, and the plain was inhabited? 

8.  The LORD Requires Justice and Mercy And came to pass the word of the lord to Zechariah, saying,

9. Thus says the lord almighty, saying, [2judgment 1A just] you shall judge, and [4mercy 5and 6compassion 1let 3execute 2each] towards  his brother!

10. And [2the widow 3and 4orphan 5and 6foreigner 7and 8needy 1tyrannize not]! and [5the hurt 2each  6of his brother 3not 1let 4resent] in  your hearts!

11. And they resisted  to take heed, and they gave their backside ranting, and  [2their ears 1pressed]  to not listen,

12. and  their heart was ordered for resisting persuasion,  to not listen to  my law, and the words which [3sent out 1the lord 2almighty] by his spirit, by the hands of the prophets, of the ones before. And there was [2anger 1great] by the lord almighty.

13. And it will be in which manner I spoke, and they did not listen to him, so they shall cry out, and in no way shall I listen, says the lord almighty.

14. And I will cast them into all the nations which they did not know. And the land shall be obliterated after them from traveling, and from returning through it. Yes, they ordered up the [2land 1choice] for extinction.  

## Zechariah 8

1.  A Future Restoration of Israel And came to pass the word of the lord almighty, saying,

2. Thus says the lord almighty, I have been zealous  for Jerusalem and  Zion [2zeal 1with a great]; even [2rage 1with great] I have been zealous over her.

3. Thus says the lord, I will return unto Zion, and I will encamp in the midst of Jerusalem. And [2will be called 1Jerusalem 4city 3the true], and the mountain of the lord almighty, [2mountain 1the holy].

4. Thus says the lord almighty, Yet shall sit down older men and older women in the squares of Jerusalem, each  [2his cane 1having] in  his hand because of a multitude of days.

5. And the squares of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in  her squares.

6. Thus says the lord almighty, Shall it be impossible in the presence of the remnant  of this people in  those days, no. Shall [2also 3before 4me 1it be impossible], says the lord almighty, no.

7. Thus says the lord almighty, Behold, I shall deliver  my people from the land of the east, and from the land of the west.

8. And I will bring them, and they will encamp in the midst of Jerusalem; and they will be to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, in truth and in righteousness.

9. Thus says the lord almighty, Strengthen  your hands, O ones hearing in  these days  these words from the mouth of the prophets, from which day [5was founded 1the 2house 3of the lord 4almighty], and  [3the temple 1from 2which day] was built.

10. For before  those days the wage  of men will not be for profitability, and the wage of the cattle does not exist. And to the one going forth and to the one entering there will be no peace because of the affliction. And I shall send out all the men, each against  his neighbor.

11. And now, not according to the days  prior will I do to the remnant  of this people, says the lord almighty,

12. but I will show peace; The grapevine shall give  her fruit, and the earth will give  her produce, and the heaven will give  its dew; and I will allot to the remnants  of my people all these things.

13. And it will be in which manner you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah, and O O house of Israel; so shall I preserve you, and you will be a blessing. Be of courage and grow strong in  your hands!

14. For thus says the lord almighty, In which manner I consider  to inflict evil on you in  [2provoking me to anger  1your fathers], says the lord almighty, and I did not change my mind.

15. So I was deployed and have considered in  these days  [2well 1to do]  for Jerusalem and the house of Judah -- be of courage!

16. These are the matters which you shall do. Let [2speak 3truth 1each] to  his neighbor, and [2judgment 1peaceable], and [2righteously 1judge] at  your gates!

17. And [2each  5evil  6against his neighbor 3not 1let 4consider] in  your hearts! And [4oath 3a lying 1do not 2love]! For all these things I detested, says the lord almighty.

18. And came to pass the word of the lord almighty to me, saying,

19. Thus says the lord almighty, Fasting on the fourth month, and fasting on the fifth, and fasting on the seventh, and fasting on the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah for joy and gladness, and for [2holiday feasts 1good]; and you shall be glad, and  [2truth 3and  4peace 1love].

20. Thus says the lord almighty, Still there shall come [2peoples 1many], and dwelling [2cities 1many].

21. And shall come together ones dwelling cities to one city, saying, We should go to beseech the face of the lord, and to seek after the face of the lord almighty -- [3shall go 1even 2I].

22. And there shall come [2peoples 1many] and many nations to seek after the face of the lord almighty in Jerusalem, and to atone  in front of the lord.

23. Thus says the lord almighty, In  those days [3shall take hold 1ten 2men] of ones of all the languages of nations. And they shall take hold of the decorative hem of a Jewish man, saying, We shall go with you, because we have heard that  God [2with 3you 1is].  

## Zechariah 9

1.  Judgment against Israel's Enemies The concern of the word of the lord against the land of Hadrach, and [2of Damascus 1his sacrifice]. For the lord inspects men, and all the tribes  of Israel;

2. and Hamath among  her limits, Tyre and Sidon, for they thought exceedingly.

3. And Tyre built a fortress to herself, and treasured up silver as dust, and gathered gold as mud of streets.

4. On account of this, the lord will inherit her, and he shall strike [2in 3the sea 1her power]; and she [2by 3fire 1shall be consumed].

5. Ashkelon shall see, and shall fear; and Gaza, even she shall grieve exceedingly; and Ekron, for she shall be ashamed over  her transgression; and [2shall perish 1the king] from Gaza; and Ashkelon in no way should be inhabited.

6. And foreigners shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will demolish the insolence of the Philistines.

7. And I will lift away  their blood from out of their mouth, and  their abominations from between their teeth. And they shall leave behind also these to our God; and they will be as under a commander of a thousand in Judah; and Ekron will be as the Jebusite.

8. And I will stand  my house on a height, so as to not travel through nor return. And in no way should there come upon them any longer ones launching an expedition, because now I have seen with  my eyes. 

9.  The Coming King of Zion Rejoice exceedingly, O daughter of Zion! Proclaim, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold,  your king comes to you, righteous and delivering. He is gentle and mounted upon a beast of burden, even [2foal 1a young].

10. And he shall utterly destroy chariots from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; [3shall be utterly destroyed 1the bow 2of warfare], and abundance and peace out of nations. And he shall rule waters unto the sea, and from rivers of the passes of the earth.

11. And you, by the blood of your covenant, sent out your prisoners from the pit not having water.

12. You shall settle [4in 5fortresses 1prisoners 2of the 3congregation]; and for one day of your sojourning [3double 1I will recompense 2to you].

13. For I stretched you tight to myself, O Judah, as a bow. I filled  Ephraim, and I will awaken  your children, O Zion, against the children of the Greeks. And I will handle you as the broadsword of a warrior.

14. And the lord [2over 3them 1shall be seen], and [2shall go forth 3as 4lightning 1his arrow]. And the lord  God by a trumpet shall trump, and [2goes 3for 4tossing about 1his intimidation].

15. The lord almighty shall shield them; and they shall consume them, and shall heap upon them with stones of a sling; and they shall drink  their blood as wine, and shall fill the bowls as an altar basin.

16. And [3shall deliver 4them 1the lord  2their God] in  that day as the sheep  of his people. For [2stones 1holy] shall roll upon his land.

17. For if anything be good of his, and if any be fair of his, the grain will be for the young men, and wine being fragrant for the virgins.  

## Zechariah 10

1.  The Ransom of the People of The LORD Ask of the lord for rain according to season, the early and late rain. The lord made a visible display; and the rain of winter he gives to them; to each, pasturage in the field.

2. For the ones declaring maxims speak troubles, and the clairvoyants [2visions 1false]; and [3dreams 2false 1they speak]. In vain they comfort. On account of this they dry up as sheep, and they were afflicted that there was no healing.

3. [3over 4the 5shepherds 2was provoked  1My rage], and over the lambs I visit]. And [4will visit 1the lord  2God  3almighty]  his flock, the house  of Judah. And he shall order them as [2horse 1his good-looking] in battle.

4. And from him he looked out upon, and from him he ordered a bow in rage, and from him shall come forth every expedition by him.

5. And they shall be as warriors treading mud in the ways in battle. And they shall deploy, because the lord is with them, and [3shall be disgraced 1the riders 2of horses].

6. And I will strengthen the house of Judah. And the house of Joseph I will deliver. And I will settle them; for I loved them. And they will be in which manner when [3not 2them 1I disowned]. Because I am the lord  their God, and I shall take heed of them.

7. And they will be as warriors to Ephraim, and [2shall rejoice  1their heart] as with wine. And  their children shall see, and be glad, and [2shall rejoice  1their heart] over the lord.

8. I will signify for them, and I will take them in. For I will ransom them, and they shall be multiplied, in so far as they were many.

9. And I will sow them among peoples, and the ones far off shall remember me. And they shall nourish  their children, and they shall return.

10. And I will turn them from out of the land of Egypt; and from the Assyrians I will take them in; and into the land of Gilead, and into  Lebanon I will bring them; and in no way should there be left behind of them not even one.

11. And they shall go through by [2sea 1the narrow], and they shall strike [2in 3the sea 1waves]; and [5shall be dried up 1all 2the 3depths 4of rivers]. And [5shall be removed 1all 2the 3insolence 4of the Assyrians]; and the staff of Egypt shall be removed.

12. And I will strengthen them in the lord their God; and in  his name they shall boast, says the lord.  

## Zechariah 11

1.  The Shepherds Open wide, O Lebanon,  your doors, and let [2devour 1fire]  your cedars!

2. Let [2shriek 1the pine]! because [2has fallen 1the cedar], for [2were in misery 1great ones]. Shriek, O oaks  of Bashan! for [4were torn down  3groves 1the 2planted].

3. A sound of wailing of shepherds, for [2languishes  1their greatness]. A sound of roaring lions, for [5languishes 1the 2neighing 3of the 4Jordan].

4. Thus says the lord almighty, Tend the sheep of the slaughter,

5. which the ones acquiring butcher, and are repenting not. And the ones selling them said, Blessed be the lord, we were enriched. And  their shepherds suffered not anything for them.

6. On account of this, I will not spare any longer over the ones inhabiting the land, says the lord. And behold, I deliver up the men, each into the hand  of his neighbor, and into the hand of his king; and they shall cut in pieces the land, and in no way should I rescue from out of their hand.

7. And I will tend the sheep of the slaughter in the land of the Canaanites. And I will take for myself two rods; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called, A piece of measured out land; and I will tend the sheep.

8. And I will lift away the three shepherds in [2month 1one]; and [2shall be weighed down  1my soul] over them, for  their souls roared against me.

9. And I said, I will not tend you. The dying, let it die! And the failing, let it fail! and the rest, let them [2eat 1each] the flesh  of his neighbor! 

10.  The Two Rods And I will take  my rod,  Beauty, and I will throw it away to efface  my covenant which I ordained with all the peoples.

11. And it shall be effaced in  that day. And [3shall know 1the 2Canaanites] the sheep being guarded for me, that [2the word 3of the lord 1it is].

12. And I will say to them, if [2good 3before 4you 1it is], give  my wage, or forbid it! And they established  my wage -- thirty pieces of silver.

13. And the lord said to me, Lower them into the foundry furnace! and to look about if it is unadulterated! in which manner I was proved for them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and I put them into the house of the lord, into the foundry furnace.

14. And I threw away  my rod, the second,  A Piece of Measured out Land --  to efface the taking possession the thing between Judah and between Israel.

15. And the lord said to me, Yet take to yourself the equipment of a shepherd -- [2shepherd 1an inexperienced]!

16. For behold, I shall arouse a shepherd against the land, one who [3the one 4faltering 1in no way 2shall visit]; and [3the one 4being dispersed 1in no way 2shall he seek]; and [3the one 4being broken 1in no way 2shall he heal]; and [3the 4whole 1in no way 2shall he conduct]. And  [3meats 1of the 2choice] he shall devour, and  [2their vertebrae 1he shall distort].

17. O the ones tending the vain things, and leaving behind the sheep; a sword shall be against  his arm, and against  [2eye  1his right].  His arm withering shall be withered, and  [2eye  1his right] by blinding shall be blinded.  

## Zechariah 12

1.  Deliverance for Judah The concern of the word of the lord over  Israel, says the lord, the one stretching out the heaven, and laying the foundation for the earth, and shaping the spirit of man in him.

2. Behold, I appoint  Jerusalem as thresholds for shaking off all the peoples round about, and in  Judea there will be an encompassing about against Jerusalem.

3. And it will be in  that day I will appoint  Jerusalem as a stone being trampled on by all the nations. Every one  trampling her with mocking shall mock, and [6shall be assembled 7against 8her 1all 2the 3nations 4of the 5earth].

4. In  that day, says the lord almighty, I will strike every horse with astonishment, and  its rider in ranting. But over the house of Judah I will open  my eyes, and all the horses of the peoples I will strike with blindness.

5. And [4shall say 1the 2commanders of thousands 3of Judah] in  their hearts, We shall find ourselves of the ones dwelling Jerusalem in the lord almighty their God.

6. In  that day I will make the commanders of thousands of Judah as a firebrand of fire among the wood, and as a lamp of fire among stubble; and they shall devour from the right, and from the left all the peoples round about. And Jerusalem shall dwell yet according to herself in Jerusalem.

7. And the lord shall deliver the tents of Judah as at the beginning, so that [3should not 4magnify 5their boasting 1the house 2of David], and the haughtiness of the ones dwelling in Jerusalem over  Judah.

8. And it will be in  that day the lord will shield over the ones dwelling Jerusalem. And it will be the one being weak among them in that  day will be as David, and the house of David as the house of God, as the angel of the lord before them.

9. And it shall be in  that day I will seek  to lift away all the nations, the ones coming against Jerusalem.

10. And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the ones dwelling Jerusalem a spirit of favor and compassion. And they shall look to me, because they treated me despitefully; and they shall beat over him with a beating of the breast, as over a beloved one; and they shall grieve with grief as over the first-born.

11. In  that day [2shall be magnified  1beating the breast] in Jerusalem, as the beating of the breast over the pomegranate grove in the plain having been cut down.

12. And [3shall beat the chest 1the 2land], according to tribes by tribes; the tribe of the house of David by itself, and  their wives by themselves; the tribe of the house of Nathan by itself, and  their wives by themselves;

13. the tribe of the house of Levi by itself, and  their wives by themselves; the tribe of Simeon by itself, and  their wives by themselves.

14. All the tribes  being left behind, a tribe by itself, and  their wives by themselves.  

## Zechariah 13

1.  The Removal of the Idols and False Prophets In  that day [3will be 1every 2place] opening wide to the house of David and to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem for the removal and for the sprinkling.

2. And it will be in  that day, says the lord of Hosts, I will utterly destroy the names of the idols from the land, and there will not be any longer a memory of them. And the false prophets and the [2spirit  1unclean] I will remove from the land.

3. And it will be if [2should prophesy 1a man] still, and shall say to him  his father and  his mother, the ones engendering him, You shall not live, for [2lies 1you spoke] upon the name of the lord; then they shall bind him  (his father and  his mother, the ones engendering him) at  his prophesying.

4. And it will be in  that day [3shall be disgraced 1the 2prophets], each at  his vision when  he prophesies; and they shall put on [2hide covering 1a hair], because they lied.

5. And he shall say, [2am not 3a prophet 1I], for [3a man 4working 5the 6ground 1I 2am]; for a man engendered me from my youth.

6. And I will say to him, What are  these wounds in the middle  of your hands? And he will say, The ones which I was struck by in the house  of my beloved.

7. O broadsword, awaken against  my shepherds, and against a man, my fellow-countryman! says the lord almighty. Strike the shepherd! and [3were dispersed 1the 2sheep]. And I will bring  my hand upon the shepherds.

8. And it will be in  that day, says the lord, the two parts shall be utterly destroyed, and shall cease; but the third part shall be left in it.

9. And I shall lead the third part through fire, and I will purify them as [2is fired  1silver], and I will try them as [2is tried  1gold]. He will call upon  my name, and I will heed him. And I will say, [3my people 1This 2is]. And he shall say, The lord  is my God.  

## Zechariah 14

1.  The Day of The LORD Behold, days [3come 1of the 2 lord], and [2shall be divided  1your spoils] among you.

2. And I will assemble all the nations against Jerusalem for battle; and [3shall be captured 1the 2city], and [3shall be plundered 1the 2houses], and the women shall be tainted. And shall come forth  half the city into captivity, and the rest  of my people in no way shall be utterly destroyed from the city.

3. And the lord shall come forth, and he shall deploy against  those nations, as the day of his battle array in the day of war.

4. And [2shall stand  1his feet] in  that day upon the mount  of olives, the one over against Jerusalem according to the east; and [4shall split 1the 2mount  3of olives],  half of it towards the east and west, [3chaos 2great 1an exceedingly]. And [4shall lean  1half 2of the 3mountain] towards the north, and  half of it towards the south.

5. And [4shall be obstructed 1the 2valley  3of my mountains], and [2shall be joined together 1the ravine] by mountains unto Azal. And it shall be obstructed in which manner it was obstructed from in front of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And [3shall come 1the lord  2my God], and all the holy ones with him.

6. And it will be in that  day there shall not be light; and chilliness and ice.

7. It shall be one day, and  that day shall be known to the lord, and neither day nor night, and towards evening it shall be light.

8. And it shall be in  that day shall come forth [2water 1living] from out of Jerusalem. The half of it into the [2sea  1foremost], and  half of it into the [2sea  1latter]; in summer and in spring thus it will be.

9. And the lord will be for king over all the earth. In  that day there shall be [2 lord 1one], and  his name one,

10. encircling all the earth, and the wilderness -- from Geba unto Remmon according to the south of Jerusalem. And Rama [2in its place 1shall remain]; from the gate of Benjamin unto the place of the [2gate  1first], and unto the gate of the corners, and unto the tower of Hananeel, unto the wine-vats of the king.

11. And they shall dwell in it, and [2anathema 1it will not be] any longer; and Jerusalem shall dwell securely. 

12.  Flesh shall Melt And this will be the downfall in which the lord shall smite all the peoples, as many as marched against Jerusalem. [2shall melt away  1Their flesh] while standing upon  their feet; and  their eyes shall flow from out of  their openings, and  their tongue shall melt away in  their mouth.

13. And there will be in  that day [2astonishment 3from the lord 1a great] upon them; and they shall take hold each the hand  of his neighbor, and shall closely join  his hand to the hand  of his neighbor.

14. And Judah shall deploy in Jerusalem; and he shall bring together the strength of all the peoples round about -- gold, and silver, and clothes into abundance exceedingly.

15. And this will be the downfall of the horses, and the mules, and the camels, and the donkeys, and of all the cattle of the ones being in  those camps, according to  this downfall. 

16.  The LORD will Rule And it will be as many as should be left of all the nations  coming against Jerusalem, that they shall ascend by year  to do obeisance to the king, to the lord almighty, and  to solemnize the holiday of the pitching of tents.

17. And it will be as many as should not ascend from out of all the tribes of the earth unto Jerusalem  to do obeisance to the king, to the lord almighty, and these things shall be added to those -- there shall not be [2upon 3them 1rain].

18. And if the tribe of Egypt should not ascend, nor come, then upon these will be the downfall which the lord struck all the nations, as many as should not ascend  to solemnize the holiday of the pitching of tents.

19. This will be the sin of Egypt, and the sin of all the nations which ever should not ascend to solemnize the holiday of the pitching of tents.

20. In  that day there will be  upon the bridle of the horse, Holy to the lord Almighty. And [7will be 1the 2kettles 3in 4the 5house 6of the lord] as bowls before the face of the altar.

21. And it will be every kettle in Jerusalem and in  Judah holy to the lord almighty. And [4shall come 1all 2the ones 3sacrificing] and shall take of them; and they shall cook with them. And there will not be any longer the Canaanite in the house of the lord of the forces in  that day.
