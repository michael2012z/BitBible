## Romans 1

1.  Chosen of Jesus Christ Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a chosen apostle, being separated for the good news of God,

2. which he preannounced through  his prophets in [2scriptures 1holy],

3. concerning  his son, (the one born of the seed of David according to flesh;

4. the one being confirmed son of God in power, according to spirit of holiness, by a resurrection of the dead) Jesus Christ  our Lord;

5. through whom we received favor and a commission, for obedience of belief among all the nations, for  his name,

6. among whom are also you, chosen of Jesus Christ.

7. To all the ones being in Rome, beloved of God, chosen holy ones. Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ. 

8.  Paul's Desire to Go to Rome First indeed, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that the belief of yours is announced in the entire  world.

9. [5witness 1For 4my 3is  2God], in whom I serve in  my spirit in the good news  of his son, how continually [2mention 3of you 1I make] at all times at  my prayers,

10. beseeching, (if by any means already at some time or other I shall prosper in the will  of God) to come to you.

11. For I long to see you, that some [3I should share 2favor 4with you 1spiritual] for  your support.

12. And this is to be comforted together among you through the [2that is in 3one another 1belief], both yours and mine.

13. [2I do not 3want 1But] you to be ignorant, brethren, for often I purposed to come to you, and was restrained as far as  until now, that [2some 3fruit 1I should have] also among you, as also among the rest of the nations.

14. Both to Greeks and barbarians, both to the wise and unthinking -- I am a debtor. 

15.  The Just Shall Live of Belief So as to me there is an eagerness also [2to you 3the ones 4in 5Rome 1to announce good news].

16. For not am I ashamed of the good news of the Christ; [3power 1for 4of God 2it is] for deliverance to every one  trusting; both to the Jew first, and to the Greek.

17. For righteousness of God [2by 3it 1is revealed] from belief unto belief; as has been written, But the just [2of 3belief 1shall live]. 

18.  God's Anger Uncovered [4is uncovered 1For 2anger 3of God] from heaven upon all impiety and unrighteousness of men, of the ones  [2truth 3in 4unrighteousness 1constraining].

19. Because the thing made known  of God is apparent among them;  for God made it apparent to them.

20. For his unseen attributes from the creation of the world to the actions being comprehended are looked at, both his everlasting power and divinity, for  them to be inexcusable.

21. Because having known  God, [2not 3as 4God 1they glorified him], or gave thanks; but acted in folly in  their thoughts, and [4was darkened  2senseless 1their 3heart].

22. Maintaining to be wise, they became moronish;

23. and they bartered the glory of the incorruptible God for a representation of an image of corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed creatures, and reptiles.

24. Therefore also [2delivered them up  1God] in the desires  of their hearts unto uncleanness,  to dishonor  their bodies among themselves;

25. the ones who changed over the truth  of God in the lie, and worshiped and served to the created thing over the one having created it, who is blessed into the eons. Amen.

26. On account of this [2delivered them up  1God] unto passions of dishonor.  For both their females changed over the physical use unto the one against nature.

27. [3in like manner 2indeed 1And] the males leaving the physical use of the female, burned away in  their lust for one another -- males with males  [2indecency 1manufacturing], and [4the 5compensation 6which 7was a necessity  8of their delusion 2in 3themselves 1accepting].

28. And as they tried not  to hold God in full knowledge, [2delivered them up  1God] unto a debased mind, to do the things not fitting;

29. being filled with all unrighteousness, harlotry, wickedness, desire for wealth, evil, full of envy, murder, strife, treachery, depraved morals, whisperers,

30. speaking vulgarities, hating God, insulting, proud, ostentatious, devisers of evils, to parents resisting persuasion,

31. senseless, contract-breakers, unaffectionate, hostile, unmerciful;

32. the ones who [2the 3ordinance  4of God 1recognizing], (that the ones  [2such 1acting 4worthy 5of death 3are]) not only do the same, but also are assenting with the ones acting such.  

## Romans 2

1.  Judging Others Therefore [2inexcusable 1you are], O man, every one  judging; [2in 3which way 1for] you judge the other, yourself you condemn; [3the 1for 4same things 2you do], O one judging.

2. For we know that the judgment  of God is according to truth upon the ones [2such things 1doing].

3. But do you think this, O man, (the one judging the ones  [2such things 1doing], and yourself doing them,) that you shall flee from the judgment  of God?

4. Or the riches  of his graciousness, and the forbearance and the leniency do you disdain; not knowing that the graciousness  of God [2to 3repentance 1leads you]?

5. But according to  your hardness and impenitent heart you treasure up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of revelation of righteous judgment  of God;

6. who will recompense each according to  his works;

7. to the ones with endurance [2work 1of good], [2glory 3and 4honor 5and 6incorruptibility 1seeking anxiously] -- life eternal.

8. And to the ones of contention and resisting persuasion, indeed to the truth, and being yielded to iniquity -- rage and wrath,

9. affliction and straits, will be upon every soul of man  manufacturing the evil thing, both of Jew first and Greek;

10. but glory, and honor, and peace will be to all, to the one working the good, both to the Jew first and to the Greek.

11. [3no 1For 2there is] discrimination by  God. 

12.  Doers of the Law For as many as lawlessly sinned, lawlessly also they shall perish; and as many as in law sinned, by law they shall be judged

13. ([6are not 1For 2the 3listeners 4of the 5law] just with  God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

14. For whenever nations, the ones not [2law 1having] by nature [2the things 3of the 4law 1should do], these [3law 1not 2having 5to themselves 4are 6law] --

15. ones who demonstrate the work of the law written in  their hearts, [3bearing witness with 1of their  2conscience], and between one another  with devices charging or also making a defense)

16. in a day when God judges the hidden things  of men, according to  my good news, through Jesus Christ. 

17.  Circumcision of the Heart Behold! you are named a Jew, and rest upon the law, and boast in God,

18. and you know the will, and you distinguish the differences, being instructed out of the law;

19. also persuading yourself to be a guide of the blind, a light of the ones in darkness,

20. a corrector of fools, a teacher of infants, having the appearance of the knowledge and of the truth in the law.

21. The one then teaching another -- [2yourself 1do you not teach]? The one proclaiming, not to steal -- do you steal?

22. The one saying, do not commit adultery -- do you commit adultery? The one abhorring the idols -- do you commit sacrilege?

23. The one who [2in 3the law 1boasts] -- through the violation of the law  do you dishonor God?

24. For the name  of God [2through 3you 1is blasphemed] among the nations, as it has been written.

25. [2circumcision 1For indeed] derives benefit if [2the law 1you should practice]; but if [2a violator 3of the law 1you should be],  your circumcision [2uncircumcision 1becomes].

26. If then the uncircumcised [2the 3ordinances 4of the 5law 1keep], shall not  his uncircumcision [2for 3circumcision 1be considered],

27. and [8shall judge 1the one 2by 3nature 4uncircumcised 6the 7law 5fulfilling] you, the one with contract and circumcision a violator of the law?

28. For not the one in the open [2a Jew 1is], nor the thing in the open in flesh circumcision;

29. But the one in the hiding is a Jew, and circumcision is in the heart in spirit, not by contract; of whom the high praise is not of men, but of  God.  

## Romans 3

1.  Benefit of Circumcision Then what is the extra thing of the Jew, or what is the benefit of the circumcision?

2. Much in every manner. For indeed first that they were trusted with the oracles  of God.

3. For what if some disbelieved? Does  their unbelief [2the 3belief  4of God 1cease to work]?

4. May it not be. [2let 4be 1But  3God] true, and every man a liar, as it has been written, That you should be justified in  your words, and should overcome in  your being judged.

5. But if  our unrighteousness [2God's 3righteousness 1commends], what shall we say? is [2unjust  1God], the one bearing upon the anger? (according to man I speak.)

6. May it not be; since how shall God judge the world?

7. For if the truth  of God [2in  3my 4untruth 1abounded] to  his glory, why yet also I as a sinner am judged?

8. and not, as we are blasphemed, and as some say we say, that, We should do the bad things that [3should come 1the 2good things]. Their  judgment is just. 

9.  All are under Sin What then, Do we have an advantage? Assuredly not. For we showed before, both Jews and Greeks, all [2under 3sin 1to be];

10. as it has been written, There is not a just man, not even one;

11. there is not one  perceiving; there is not one  seeking after  God.

12. All have turned aside, together they became useless; there is not one having graciousness; there is not even one.

13. [3is a tomb 2having been opened  1Their throat]; with their tongues they use deceit; the poison of asps is under  their lips;

14. whose  mouth [2of curse 3and 4bitterness 1is full];

15. keen  are their feet to pour out blood;

16. destruction and misery are in  their ways;

17. and the way of peace they knew not.

18. There is no fear of God before  their eyes. 

19.  Justified Without Charge And we know that as much as the law says, [2to the ones 3in 4the 5law 1it speaks]; that every mouth should be shut, and [5subject to trial 4should be 1all 2the 3world]  to God.

20. Because by works of the law [3shall not 4be justified 1all 2flesh] before him; for through the law is full knowledge of sin.

21. But now [4separate 5of the law 1the righteousness 2of God 3has been made apparent], being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

22. even righteousness of God through belief of Jesus Christ, unto all and for all the ones trusting; [3not 1for 2there is] a difference;

23. for all sinned and lack the glory  of God;

24. being justified without charge by his favor, through the release by ransom, of the one by Christ Jesus;

25. whom God set forth as an atonement through the belief, in the one of his blood, for a demonstration  of his righteousness through the letting pass of the preceding sins,

26. in the forbearance  of God, for a demonstration  of his righteousness in the present time; for  his being just and justifying the one of belief of Jesus.

27. Where then is the boasting? It was excluded. Through what kind of law? Of the law of works? No, but through a law of belief.

28. We consider then [3by belief 2to be justified 1a man], separate from works of law.

29. Or [3of Jews  1is God 2only]? But is he not also of nations? Yes, also of nations.

30. Since indeed there is one  God who shall justify the circumcision of belief and uncircumcision through the belief.

31. Law then do we render useless through the belief? May it not be, But [2law 1we establish].  

## Romans 4

1.  Abraham Justified by Trusting What then shall we say Abraham  our father has found according to the flesh?

2. For if Abraham [2of 3works 1was justified], he has boasting, but not towards  God.

3. For what does the scripture say? [3trusted 1But 2Abraham]  in God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.

4. And to the one working, the wage is not considered according to favor, but according to the debt.

5. But to the one not working, but trusts upon the one justifying the impious, [2is imputed  1his belief] for righteousness.

6. Just as also David says about the blessing of the man to whom  God imputes righteousness separate from works.

7. Blessed whom [3were forgiven 1the 2lawless deeds], and whom [3were covered over 1the 2sins].

8. Blessed is a man in whom in no way the Lord should impute sin.

9.  [2blessing 3then 1Is this] upon the circumcision or also upon the uncircumcision? For we say that [3was imputed 4to 5Abraham 1the 2belief] for righteousness.

10. How then was it imputed? [2in 3circumcision 1being], or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

11. And [2the sign 1he received] of circumcision as seal of the righteousness of the belief of the one in the uncircumcision, for  him to be father of all of the ones trusting through uncircumcision, for  [3to be imputed 4also 5to them 1the 2righteousness];

12. and father of circumcision to the ones not of circumcision only, but also to the ones conforming to the tracks of the belief to the ones in the uncircumcision  of our father Abraham. 

13.  The Promise to Abraham For not through law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed,  [3heir 1for him 2to be] of the world, but through righteousness of belief.

14. For if the ones from the law be heirs, [3is empty 1the 2belief], and [3ceases to work 1the 2promise].

15. For the law [2wrath 1manufactures]; for where there is no law, not even is there a violation.

16. On account of this it is of belief, that according to favor, for the [2to be 3firm  1promise] to all the seed, not to the one of the law only, but also to the one of belief of Abraham, who is father of all of us,

17. (as it has been written, that, [3father 4of many 5nations 1I have established 2you],) in front of which he trusted God, of the one restoring [3to life 1the 2dead], and calling the ones not being, as being;

18. who against hope [2upon 3hope 1trusted], for  him to become father of many nations; according to the thing being said, So shall [2be  1your seed].

19. And not being weak in the belief, he did not contemplate  his own body already deadened, [3a hundred years old 2somewhere about 1being], and the deadening of the womb of Sarah.

20. And at the promise  of God he did not examine  by unbelief, but was empowered in the belief, giving glory to God,

21. and having full assurance that what he has promised, he is able also to do.

22. Therefore also it was imputed to him for righteousness.

23. [2it was not 3written 1But] on account of him only, that -- it was imputed to him,

24. but also on account of us, to the ones whom it was about to be imputed, to the ones trusting upon the one having raised Jesus  our Lord from the dead;

25. who was delivered up on account of  our transgressions, and was raised on account of  our justification.  

## Romans 5

1.  Christ Died for Us Having been justified then of belief, [2peace 1we have] towards  God through  our Lord Jesus Christ,

2. through whom also  [2access 1we have] to the belief in  this favor in which we stand and boast upon in hope of the glory  of God.

3. [2not 3only that 1And], but also we boast in the afflictions, knowing that the affliction [2endurance 1manufactures];

4. and the endurance proof; and the proof hope;

5. and the hope does not shame; for the love  of God has been poured out in  our hearts through [2spirit 1holy], of the one having been given to us.

6. For still while [4Christ 2were 1we 3weak 6in due time 7for 8the impious 5died].

7. For hardly for a just man shall one die; for over the good man perhaps someone even dares to die;

8. [3commends 1but  4his own 5love 6for 7us  2God], that yet [2being sinners 1we], Christ [2for 3us 1died].

9. Much more then, having been justified now in  his blood, we shall be delivered by him from the wrath.

10. For if being enemies, we were reconciled  to God through the death  of his son, how much more having been reconciled, shall we be delivered in  his life.

11. [2not 3only that 1And], but also boasting in  God through  our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now [2the 3reconciliation 1we received].

12. On account of this as if through one man the sin [2into 3the 4world 1entered], and through the sin --  death; and thus to all men  death went through, because by which reason all sinned.

13. For until law, sin was in the world; but sin not charged, not being law.

14. But [2reigned  1death] from Adam until Moses, reigning even upon the ones not having sinned in the likeness of the violation of Adam, who is a model of the one being about to come.

15. But shall not as the transgression, so also be the favor? For if in the [2of the 3one 1transgression] the many died, to many more the favor  of God and the gift by favor in the favor of the one man Jesus Christ to the many abounded.

16. And shall not as by one man having sinned the gift be by one man? For indeed the judgment of one was unto condemnation, but the favor of the many transgressions was unto justice.

17. For if in the [2of the 3one 1transgression]  death reigned through the one, how much more the ones [2the 3abundance  4of favor 5and 6the 7gift  8of righteousness 1receiving] [2in 3life 1shall reign] through the one man Jesus Christ.

18. It is so then as through one transgression it was unto all men for condemnation; so also through one right action it was unto all men for justification of life.

19. For as by the disobedience of the one man [3as sinners 2were established  1many]; so also by the obedience of the one man [3as righteous 2shall be established  1many].

20. But law entered privately, that [2should be superabundant  1transgression]. But where [2was superabundant  1sin], [2superabounded  1favor];

21. that as [2reigned  1sin] in  death, so also the favor should reign through righteousness to life eternal through Jesus Christ  our Lord.  

## Romans 6

1.  Dying to Sin What then shall we say? Shall we remain in  sin that  favor should be superabundant?

2. May it not be. We who died  to sin, how shall we still live in it?

3. Or do you not know that as many as we were immersed unto Christ Jesus, unto  his death we were immersed?

4. We were buried together then with him through the immersion into  death; that as [2arose 1Christ] from the dead by the glory of the father, so also we in newness of life should walk.

5. For if [2planted together 1we have become] in the likeness  of his death, so also of his resurrection we shall be.

6. Knowing this, that  our old man was crucified along with him, that [4should cease work 1the 2body  3of sin], that [2no longer 3are to be a slave 1we]  to sin.

7. For the one having died has been justified from  sin.

8. And if we died with Christ, we trust that also we shall live together with him;

9. knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, no longer dies; death [3him 1no longer 2dominates].

10. For the fact he died,  [2sin 1he died to] once for all; but the fact he lives, he lives  to God.

11. So also you impute yourselves [2dead 3indeed 1to be] to the sin, but being alive to God, in Christ Jesus  our Lord.

12. [3not 1Then 2let 5reign  4sin] in  your mortal body! for the obeying it in  its desires.

13. Nor present  your members as weapons of iniquity to sin! But render yourselves to God! as [2from out of 3the dead 1one living], and  your members as weapons of righteousness  to God.

14. For sin [3you 1shall not 2dominate]; [3not 1for 2you are] under law, but under favor.

15. What then, should we sin that we are not under law, but under favor? May it not be.

16. Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves servants to obedience, servants you are to whom you obey; either sin unto death, or obedience unto righteousness?

17. But favor to God, for you were slaves  of sin, but you obeyed from the heart in which [3you were delivered by 1model 2of teaching].

18. And having been set free from  sin, you were enslaved to righteousness.

19. Humanly I speak, on account of the weakness  of your flesh; for as you rendered  your members subservient  to uncleanness and  to lawlessness unto  lawlessness; so now render  your members subservient to the righteousness unto sanctification!

20. For when you were servants  of sin, you were free in the righteousness.

21. What fruit therefore had you then, in the things in which now you are ashamed? For the end of those things is death.

22. But now having been set free from the sin, and having been enslaved to God, you have  your fruit unto sanctification, and the end -- life eternal.

23. For the rations  of sin are death; but the favor  of God is life eternal in Christ Jesus  our Lord.  

## Romans 7

1.  Free from the Law Or do you not know, brethren, (for to the ones knowing law I speak), that the law dominates the man over as much time as he lives?

2. For the married woman [3to the 4living 5husband 1is tied 2by law]. But if [3should die 1the 2husband], she is cleared from the law of the husband.

3. Surely then [3living 1with the 2husband], [2as an adulteress 1she shall be treated], if she becomes [2man 1to another]; but if [3should die 1the 2husband], she is free from the law,  for her to not be an adulteress, having become [2man 1to another].

4. So that, my brethren, also you were put to death to the law through the body of the Christ; for  you to become to another, to the one [2from 3the dead 1being arisen], that we should bear fruit to God.

5. For when we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins, the ones through the law exerted energy in  our members for the bearing fruit to death.

6. But now we were cleared from the law, having died by which we were held; so as for us to serve in newness of spirit, and not oldness of contract.

7. What then shall we say? Is the law sin? May it not be. But the sin I knew not, except through the law;  for also lust I knew not, except the law said, You shall not lust.

8. [4an opportunity 1But 3taking  2sin] through the commandment, manufactured in me every lust; for separate from the law sin was dead;

9. and I was alive separate from the law at some time or other; [4having come 1but 2the 3commandment],  sin was revived, and I died.

10. And [5was found 6by me 1the 2commandment  3for 4life], for this to be to death.

11.  For sin [2opportunity 1having taken] through the commandment, cheated me, and through it killed me.

12. So that the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.

13. The thing then good, [3to me 1has it become 2death]? May it not be. But the sin, that it should appear sin, through the good in me manufacturing death, that [2should become 3excessively 4sinful  1sin] through the commandment.

14. For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, having been sold under the sin.

15. For what I manufacture, I do not know; for not what I want to do, this I practice; and what I detest, this I do.

16. But if what I do not want to do, this I do, then I assent to the law that it is good.

17. But now, no longer I manufacture it, but it is [2living 3in 4me 1the sin].

18. For I know that there does not live in me (that is to say in  my flesh) good. For the will is present with me, but the manufacturing the good I do not find.

19. [3not do 1For 5which 6I want to do 2I do 4the good], but [2which 3I do not 4want to do 1the evil], this I do.

20. But if what [2do not 3want to do 1I], this I do; no longer I manufacture it, but it is [2living 3in 4me 1sin].

21. I find then the law, in the one wanting in me to do the good, that with me the evil is present.

22. For I delight in the law  of God according to the inside man.

23. But I see another law in  my members, undertaking an expedition against the law  of my mind, and captivating me to the law of the sin, to the one being in  my members.

24. O miserable man am I. Who shall rescue me from  [2body  3of death 1this]?

25. I give thanks to God because of Jesus Christ  our Lord. It is so then, I myself indeed to the mind serve the law of God, but to the flesh the law of sin.  

## Romans 8

1.  The Law of the Spirit In nothing then is there now condemnation to the ones in Christ Jesus, not [2according to 3the flesh 1walking], but according to spirit.

2. For the law of the spirit of the life in Christ Jesus freed me from the law of the sin and  of death.

3. For the powerlessness of the law in which it was weak through the flesh,  God  [2his own 3son 1sent forth] in the likeness of flesh of sin, and concerning sin condemned the sin in the flesh,

4. that the ordinance of the law should be fulfilled in us, to the ones not [2according to 3flesh 1walking], but according to spirit.

5. For the ones [2according to 3flesh 1being] [2the things 3of the 4flesh 1think]; but the ones according to spirit think the things of the spirit.

6. For the thought of the flesh is death, but the thought of the spirit is life and peace.

7. Because the thought of the flesh is hatred to God; for to the law  of God it does not submit, for neither is it able;

8. and the ones [2in 3flesh 1being 7God 6to please 4are not 5able].

9. But you are not in flesh, but in spirit, if indeed spirit of God lives in you. But if anyone [3spirit 4of Christ 1does not 2have], this one is not of him.

10. But if Christ is in you, indeed the body is dead on account of sin, but the spirit is life through righteousness.

11. And if the spirit of the one raising Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one having raised the Christ from the dead shall restore to life also  [2mortal 3bodies 1your] on account of  [3dwelling 1his 2spirit] in you.

12. It is so then, brethren, [3debtors 1we are 2not] to the flesh,  [2according to 3flesh 1to live].

13. For if [2according to 3flesh 1you live] you are about to die. But if in spirit [2the 3actions 4of the 5body 1you put to death] you shall live.

14. For as many as [2in spirit 3of God 1are led], these are sons of God.

15. [3not 1For 2you received] a spirit of slavery again unto fear, but you received a spirit of adoption, in which we cry out, Abba,  Father.

16. [3itself 1The 2spirit] bears witness together to our spirit, that we are children of God.

17. And if children, also heirs; heirs indeed of God, but joint-heirs of Christ; if indeed we suffer together, that also we should be glorified together. 

18.  The Sufferings of the Present Time For I consider that [6are not 7worthy to be compared 1the 2sufferings 3of the 4present 5time] to the [2about to be 1glory] uncovered unto us.

19. For the earnest expectation of the creation [2the 3uncovering 4of the 5sons  6of God 1awaits].

20.  For to vanity the creation was submitted, not willingly, but through the one submitting it, upon hope;

21. that even [3itself 1the 2creation] shall be freed from the slavery  of corruption, unto the freedom of the glory of the children  of God.

22. For we know that all the creation groans together, and suffers distress together, as far as the present.

23. [2not 3only that 1And], but also ourselves [2the 3first-fruit 4of the 5spirit 1having], even we ourselves in ourselves moan, [2adoption 1awaiting] -- the release by ransom  of our body.

24. For in the hope we were delivered. But hope being seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why also does he hope?

25. But if [2for what 3we do not 4see 1we hope], [2by 3endurance 1we await].

26. And likewise also the spirit aids in our weaknesses. For the thing -- what we pray for according to necessity, we do not know; but [3itself 1the 2spirit] intercedes for us [2moanings 1with unutterable].

27. But the one searching the hearts knows what the thought of the spirit is, for according to God it intercedes for the holy ones.

28. But we know that to the ones loving  God all things work together for good, to the ones [3according to 4purpose 2called 1being].

29. For of whom he foreknew, also he predefined conformable to the image  of his son, for  him to be first-born among many brethren.

30. But the ones whom he predefined, these also he called. And whom he called, these also he justified. And whom he justified, these also he glorified. 

31.  God's Everlasting Love What then shall we say to these things? If  God is for us, who is against us?

32. The one who indeed  [2his own 3son 1spared not], but [2for 3us 4all 1delivered him up], how [2not 3also 7with 8him 5all things 6to us 1shall he 4grant]?

33. Who accuses against the chosen of God? God is the one justifying.

34. Who is the one condemning? Christ is the one having died, and more also being arisen, who also is at the right of God, who also intercedes for us.

35. Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? affliction, or straits, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

36. As it has been written, that, Because of you we are put to death the entire day; we are considered as sheep for slaughter.

37. But in all these things we are completely victorious through the one having loved us.

38. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor sovereignties, nor powers, nor things present, nor things about to be,

39. nor height, nor depth, nor any [2creation 1other], shall be able to separate us from the love  of God, of the one in Christ Jesus  our Lord.  

## Romans 9

1.  Paul's Grief for His Brethren [2truth 1I speak] in Christ, I do not lie, (bearing witness with me  is my conscience in [2spirit 1holy],)

2. that [2distress 3is with me 1great], and continual grief  in my heart.

3. For I would make a vow, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ for  my brethren,  of my relatives according to flesh;

4. the ones who are Israelites, whom is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the legislation, and the service, and the promises,

5. whom are the fathers, and of whom the Christ came  according to flesh, the one being over all -- God blessed into the eons. Amen.

6. [2not 3such as 1But] that [4has fallen 1the 2word  3of God]; for not all the ones of Israel are these Israel;

7. and not that [3are 4seed 5of Abraham 1all 2children]; but, In Isaac [2shall be called 3to you 1a seed].

8. That is to say, not the children of the flesh are these children  of God; but the children of the promise are imputed for seed.

9. For of promise  is this word, According to  this time I will come, and [2will be  3to Sarah 1a son].

10. [2not 3only this 1And], but also Rebecca from out of one marriage-bed had Isaac  our father

11. (for not yet being born, nor having done anything good or bad, that  [3according to 4choice  2of God 1the intention] should abide, not from works, but of the one calling),

12. and it was said to her that, The greater shall serve the lesser.

13. As it has been written,  Jacob I loved,  but Esau I detested.

14. What then shall we say? There is no injustice with  God? May it not be.

15.  For to Moses he says, I will show mercy on whom ever I should show mercy, and I shall pity whom ever I should pity.

16. So then it is not of the one wanting, nor of the one running, but of the showing mercy of God.

17. [4says 1For 2the 3scripture] to Pharaoh that, For this same thing I awakened you, so that I should demonstrate in you  my power, and so that I should declare  my name in all the earth.

18. So then whom he wants, he shows mercy; but whom he wants, he hardens.

19. You will say then to me, Why yet does he complain?  For [3his will 1who 2has opposed]?

20. Certainly, O man, [3you 1who 2are] the one answering to God? Shall [3say 1the 2thing shaped] to the one shaping, Why have you made me thus?

21. Or has not [3authority 1the 2potter] of the clay, from out of the same batch, to make the one indeed for [2of honor 1a vessel], and the other for dishonor?

22. And if God wanting to demonstrate the wrath, and to make known  his might, he bore with much leniency vessels of wrath being readied for destruction;

23. and that he should make known the riches  of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,

24. whom also he called us not only from out of Jews, but also from out of the nations,

25. (as also in  Hosea he says, I will call the one not my people, My people; and the one not being loved, One being loved;

26. and it will be in the place where it was said to them, [2not 3my people 1You are], there they shall be called Sons of the living God;

27. and Isaiah cries out over  Israel, saying, Though [6should be 1the 2number 3of the 4sons 5of Israel] as the sand of the sea, the vestige shall be preserved,)

28. [3a reckoning 1for 2completing], and rendering it concise in righteousness; that [4reckoning 3a concise 2will make 1the Lord] upon the earth.

29. And as Isaiah described before, Unless the Lord of Hosts left behind for us a seed, [2as 3Sodom 1we would have become], and as Gomorrah we would be like.

30. What then shall we say? That nations, the ones not pursuing righteousness, overtook righteousness; but righteousness, the one of belief.

31. But Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, [2unto 3the law 4of righteousness 1attained not].

32. Why? Because it was not of belief, but as of works of law. For they stumbled against the stone  of stumbling;

33. as it has been written, Behold, I put in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; and every one  trusting upon him shall not be disgraced.  

## Romans 10

1.  Deliverance Offered to Jews and Greeks Brethren, indeed the good-pleasure, of the one of my heart, and the supplication, the one towards  God for  Israel is for deliverance.

2. For I bear witness to them that [2zeal 3of God 1they have], but not according to full knowledge.

3. For being ignorant of the thing of the righteousness of God, and  [3their own 4righteousness 1seeking 2to establish], [3to the 4righteousness  5of God 1they did not 2submit].

4. [3is the end 1For 6of the law 2Christ 4for 5righteousness] to every one  trusting.

5. For Moses writes about the righteousness, the one of the law, that, The [2observing 3them 1man] shall live by them.

6. But of the [2of belief 1righteousness] thus he says, You should not say in  your heart, Who shall ascend unto the heaven? that is to say, [2Christ 1to lead] down;

7. or, Who shall go down into the abyss? that is to say, [2Christ 3from 4the dead 1to lead].

8. But what does it say? [4near 5you 1The 2word 3is], in  your mouth and in  your heart; (that is to say the word of the belief which we proclaim;)

9. that if you should acknowledge in  your mouth the Lord Jesus, and should trust in  your heart that  God raised him from the dead, you shall be delivered.

10. For the heart trusts unto righteousness; and the mouth acknowledges to deliverance.

11. [4says 1For 2the 3scripture], Every one  trusting upon him shall not be put to shame.

12. [3no 1For 2there is] difference [2of Jew 1both] and Greek; for the same Lord of all is being rich unto all the ones calling upon him.

13. For every one who ever should call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered.

14. How then should they call unto whom they do not trust? And how shall they trust of whom they heard not? And how shall they hear separate from one proclaiming?

15. And how shall they proclaim if there should not be one sent? As it has been written, How beautiful the feet of the ones announcing good news of peace; of the ones announcing good news of  good things.

16. But not all hearkened to the good news; for Isaiah says, O Lord, who trusted  our report?

17. So the belief is from report, and the report through the word of God.

18. But I say, Did they not hear? Certainly, for [3unto all 4the 5earth 2went forth  1their knell], and [2went unto 3the 4ends 5of the 6habitable world  1their words].

19. But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy over that not a nation; by [2nation 1a senseless] I will provoke you to anger.

20. And Isaiah was very bold, and he says, I was found by the ones [3me 1not 2seeking]; [2apparent 1I became] to the ones [3for me 1not 2asking].

21. But to  Israel he says, The entire day I spread forth  my hands to a people resisting persuasion and disputing.  

## Romans 11

1.  The Remnant of Israel I say then, Did God thrust away  his people? May it not be. For even I am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

2. [2did not 3thrust away  1God]  his people whom he foreknew. Or do you not know in Elijah what [3says 1the 2scripture], how he intercedes  with God according to  Israel, saying,

3. O Lord,  [2your prophets 1they killed], and  your altars they razed, and I [2am left 1alone], and they seek  my life.

4. But what says [3to him 1the 2divine answer]? I left behind to myself seven thousand men, the ones who have not bent a knee  to Baal.

5. So then also in the present time a remnant according to choice of favor takes place.

6. But if by favor, no longer of works; else the favor no longer becomes favor. But if of works, no longer is it favor; else the work no longer is work.

7. What then? What Israel seeks anxiously for, this it did not succeed in; but the chosen succeeded, and the remaining were callous,

8. (as it has been written, [2gave 3to them  1God] a spirit of vexation, of eyes  to not see, and ears  to not hear,) until  today's day.

9. And David says, Let [2become  1their table] for a snare, and for a trap, and for an obstacle, and for a recompense to them!

10. Let [2be darkened  1their eyes]  to not see, and  their back always bent downwards! 

11.  The Engrafted Branches I say then, did they stumble that they should fall? May it not be. But in their transgression the deliverance came to the nations, for the provoking them to jealousy.

12. But if  their transgression was for the wealth of the world, and  their vanquishing for the wealth of nations, how much more  their fullness?

13. [3to you 1For 2I speak], to the nations; upon as much as indeed I am [2of the nations 1an apostle],  [2my service 1I glorify],

14. if by any means I should provoke to jealousy the ones of my  flesh, and shall deliver some from among them.

15. For if the casting off of them be for the reconciliation of the world, what will be the reception of them, unless life from the dead.

16. And if the first-fruit be holy, also the batch; and if the root be holy, also the branches.

17. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you being a wild olive tree were engrafted in them, and [2fellow-partakers 3of the 4root 5and 6the 7fatness 8of the 9olive tree 1became],

18. glory not over the branches! But if you gloried over them, know that you do not [2the 3root 1bear], but the root bears you.

19. You will say then, [3were broken off 1the 2branches] that I should be engrafted.

20. Well,  by unbelief they were broken off, and you in the belief stand. Be not high-minded, but fear.

21. For if  God  [3according to 4nature 2the branches 1spared not], perhaps not even you he shall spare.

22. Behold then the graciousness and severity of God! indeed upon the ones having fallen -- severity; but upon you -- graciousness, if you should remain in the graciousness; else also you shall be cut off.

23. [2also 3those 1And] if they do not remain in the unbelief, shall be engrafted; [4able 1for 3is  2God] again to engraft them.

24. For if you, [2from  4according to 5nature 1were cut off 3the wild olive tree], and contrary to nature were engrafted into the fruitful olive tree; how much more these, the ones according to nature, shall be engrafted into their own olive tree? 

25.  Future Deliverance for Israel For I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren,  of this mystery, that you should not be [2in 3yourselves 1intelligent], that callousness [2in part 3to 4Israel 1has happened] until of which time the fullness of the nations should enter in.

26. And so all Israel shall be delivered, as it has been written, [3shall come 4from out of 5Zion 1the one 2rescuing], and he shall turn impious deeds from Jacob.

27. And this [3to them 1is the 4by 5me 2covenant], whenever I should remove  their sins.

28. Indeed according to the good news, enemies for your account; but according to the selection, beloved on account of the fathers.

29. For irrevocable are the favors and the calling  of God.

30. For as also you at some time or other resisted persuasion to God, but now you were shown mercy in the [2of these 1disobedience];

31. so also these now resisted persuasion to your mercy, that also they should be shown mercy.

32. [3closed up 1For  2God] all of the ones in disobedience, that all of the ones he should show mercy.

33. O the depth of wealth and wisdom and knowledge of God; as unsearchable  are his judgments, and untraceable  are his ways.

34. For who knew the mind of the Lord, or who [2his counselor 1became]?

35. Or who first gave to him and he shall recompense to him?

36. For from out of him and through him and unto him are all things. To him be the glory into the eons. Amen.  

## Romans 12

1.  Living Sacrifices Then I exhort you, brethren, by the compassions  of God, to present  your bodies [2sacrifices 1living], holy, well-pleasing to God, the rational service of yours.

2. And be not conformed to this eon, but be transformed in the renewal  of your mind, in the trying of yourselves, in what is the [6will  7of God  1good 2and 3well-pleasing 4and 5perfect]!

3. For I say by the favor  being given to me, to every one  being among you, to not be high-minded above what you must think; but to think to  be of a sound mind; to each as  God portioned a measure of belief. 

4.  Many Members but One Body For just as in one body [3members 2many 1we have], [3the 1but 4members 2all] do not [2the 3same 1have] action;

5. thus [2the 3many 4are one 5body 1we] in Christ, and each one [2of one another 1members].

6. But having [2favors 3according to 4the 5favor  6being given 7to us 1diverse]; whether prophecy, let it be according to the ratio of the belief;

7. whether service, in the service; whether the teaching, in the instruction;

8. whether the comforting, in the comfort; the sharing, in simplicity; the being in charge, with diligence; the showing of mercy, with happiness;

9. the love, unpretentious; abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good;

10. in the brotherly affection, [2for 3one another 1having a strong natural affection]; in the honor, [2for one another 1giving preference];

11. in the diligence, not lazy; in the spirit, bubbling; to the Lord, serving;

12. in the hope, rejoicing; in the affliction, enduring; in the prayer, constantly attending to;

13. in the needs of the holy ones, participating in; the hospitality, pursuing.

14. Bless the ones persecuting you! bless and do not curse!

15. Rejoice with ones rejoicing! and weep with ones weeping!

16. [2the 3same 4to 5one another 1Be thinking]; not the high thinking, but [2the 3lowly 1associating with]; do not become intelligent for yourselves!

17. To no one [2bad 3for 4bad 1rendering]. Thinking beforehand good things before all men.

18. If possible, as to yourselves, with all men being at peace;

19. not by yourselves avenging, beloved, but give place  to wrath! For it has been written, Vengeance is mine, I will recompense, says the Lord.

20. If then [2should hunger  1your enemy], feed him! If he should thirst, give him a drink! For this doing [2coals 3of fire 1you shall heap] upon  his head.

21. Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome [3by 4the 5good 1the 2evil]!  

## Romans 13

1.  Submission to Authorities Every soul [2to authorities 3being superior 1be submitted]! [3no 1For 2there is] authority unless from God; and the ones being authorities [2by  3God 1are ordered].

2. So that the one rebelling against the authority, [2in the  3disposition of God 1opposes]; and the ones opposing, [3to themselves 2judgment 1shall receive].

3. For the rulers are not a fear of the ones of good works, but of the ones of evils. [2you should 4want 1But 3not] to be fearful of the authority; by the [2good 1doing] even you shall have high praise from it.

4. [3of God 1For 2it is a servant] to you for  good. But if  [2evil 1you should do], fear! for it does not [4in vain 2the 3sword 1wear]. [4of God 1For 3a servant 2it is], punishing for wrath to the one  [2evil 1doing].

5. Therefore it is a necessity to be submitted, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience.

6. [2on account of 3this 1For] also [2paying the tribute 1fulfill]! [3ministers 1for 4of God 2they are] in this same thing attending to constantly.

7. Render then to all the debts! to the one for the tribute -- the tribute; to the one for the tax -- the tax; to the one  commanding fear -- the fear; to the one  commanding honor -- the honor.

8. To no one owe anything, unless it be loving one another. For the one loving the other [2the law 1has fulfilled].

9. For the commandment, you shall not commit adultery; you shall not murder; you shall not steal; you shall not lust; and if any other commandment, in this the word is recapitulated, in the saying You shall love  your neighbor as yourself.

10. The love to the neighbor [2evil 1works no], [3then is the fullness 4of the law 1the 2love]. 

11.  Clothe on The Lord Jesus Christ Also this, knowing the time, that the hour we already from out of sleep arise; for now [2is nearer 3us  1deliverance] than when we trusted.

12. The night progressed, and the day approached. We should put aside then the works  of darkness, and put on the weapons of the light.

13. As [3by 4day 2decently 1we should walk]; not in debaucheries and in intoxications; not in beds and in lewdnesses; not in strife and in jealousy.

14. But clothe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and [6of the 7flesh 3forethought 1do not 2have 4for 5desire].  

## Romans 14

1.  Receive the Weak But the one being weak in the belief take to yourselves! not for distinction of arguings.

2. Indeed one trusts to eat all things; and the one being weak [2vegetables 1eats].

3. The one eating, [2the one 3not 4eating 1treat not with contempt]! and the one not eating, [2the one 3eating 1judge not]!  for God received him to himself.

4. [3you 1Who 2are], the one judging a stranger's servant? To his own master he stands or falls, but he shall be established; [4able 1for 3is  2God] to establish him.

5. The one who indeed judges a day over a day, and who judges every day -- [2each 4in  5his own 6mind 1let 3have full assurance]!

6. The one regarding the day, regards it to the Lord; and the one not regarding the day, [2to the Lord 1regards it not]. The one eating, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and the one not eating, [2to the Lord 1eats not], and he gives thanks to God.

7. For not one of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.

8. [2if 3both 1For] we should live, [2to the 3Lord 1we should live]; and if we should die, [2to the 3Lord 1we should die]. If both then we should live, and if we should die, [2of the 3Lord 1we are].

9. For, for this Christ both died, and rose up, and lived, that both the dead and living he should lord over.

10. But you, why do you judge  your brother? or also why do you treat with contempt  your brother? for all of us shall stand before the rostrum of the Christ.

11. For it has been written, As I live, says the Lord, that to me [3shall bend 1every 2knee], and every tongue shall make acknowledgment to God.

12. So then each of us concerning himself [2account 1shall give] to God. 

13.  The Law of Love No longer then [2one another 1should we judge]. But this judge rather!  to not put an occasion of stumbling to the brother or an obstacle!

14. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is profane of itself; except to the one considering anything to be profane, to that one it is profane.

15. But if on account of food  your brother frets, no longer [2according to 3love 1do you walk]. Do not  [3by your food 2that one 1destroy], for of whom Christ died!

16. Let not be blasphemed then your  good!

17. For not is the kingdom  of God food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in [2spirit 1holy].

18. For the one [4in 5these things 1serving 2the 3Christ] is well-pleasing  to God, and approved  by men.

19. So then the things  of peace we should pursue, and the things of the edifying the thing for one another.

20. Do not [5because of 6food 1destroy 2the 3work  4of God]. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil to the man  [2by 3an occasion of stumbling someone 1who eats].

21. It is good  to not eat meats, nor to drink wine, nor anything in which  your brother stumbles against, or be caused to stumble, or is weak.

22. You [2belief 1have]? According to yourself have it before  God! Blessed is the one not judging himself in what he distinguishes.

23. But the one scrutinizing, if he should eat, has been condemned, for it is not of belief; and everything which is not of belief is sin.  

## Romans 15

1.  Bear One Another's Weaknesses [5ought 1But 2we 3the ones 4able] [2the 3weaknesses 4of the ones 5disabled 1to bear], and not to please just ourselves.

2. [3each 1For 4of us  6his neighbor 2let 5please] for  good and for edifying!

3. For even the Christ [2not 3himself 1pleased]; but as it has been written, The scornings of the ones berating you fell upon me.

4. For as much as was written beforehand, [2for  3our 4instruction 1it was written beforehand], that through the endurance and on account of the comfort of the scriptures  [2hope 1we should have].

5. And the God  of patience and  comfort, may he give to you the same regard with one another according to Christ Jesus;

6. that with one accord, in one mouth you should glorify  God and father  of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7. Therefore take to yourself one another! as also the Christ took you to himself, for the glory of God.

8. But I say, Christ Jesus [2a servant 1has become] of the circumcision for the truth of God, for the firming the promises of the fathers;

9. and the nations for mercy to glorify  God, as it has been written, saying, Because of this I will make acknowledgment to you among the nations, and to your name I will strum.

10. And again it says, Be glad, O nations, with  his people!

11. And again, Praise the Lord, all the nations, and praise him all  peoples!

12. And again Isaiah says, There will be the root  of Jesse, and the one rising up to rule nations, upon him nations shall hope.

13. And the God  of hope, may he fill you with all joy and peace in  trusting, for  you abounding in the hope, in power [2spirit 1of holy]. 

14.  Ministry to the Nations But I am persuaded, my brethren, even I myself, concerning you, that you also are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge, being able even [2others 1to admonish].

15. But more daring I wrote to you, brethren, in part, as reminding you, through the favor, the one being given to me by  God,

16. for  me to be a minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, administering in sacred service the good news  of God, that [5should be 1the 2offering 3of the 4nations] well-received, having been sanctified in [2spirit 1holy].

17. I have then a boasting in Christ Jesus -- the things about  God.

18. [3not 1For 2I dare] to speak anything which [2did not manufacture 1Christ] through me for the obedience of the nations -- by word and work,

19. in the power of signs and miracles, in the power of spirit of God; so as for me from Jerusalem and round about unto  Illyricum to accomplish the good news  of Christ.

20. And so striving earnestly to announce good news, [3was not 1where 4named 2Christ], that [2not 4upon 5another's 6foundation 1I should 3build];

21. but as it has been written, To the ones to whom it was not announced concerning him, they shall see; and the ones who have not heard, they shall perceive.

22. Therefore also I was hindered the many times  to come to you.

23. But now no longer [2a place 1having] in  these regions, [3a longing 1and 2having]  to come to you for many years,

24. whenever I should go into  Spain I will come to you; for I hope traveling by to see you, and by you to be sent forward there, if I should [5by you 1first 3in 4part 2be filled up].

25. But now I go unto Jerusalem, serving to the holy ones.

26. [5think well 1For 2Macedonia 3and 4Achaia 8fellowship contribution 7a certain 6to make] unto the poor of the holy ones, of the ones in Jerusalem.

27. For they take pleasure in it, and [2debtors 1they are their]. For if to the [3spiritual things 2they participated in their  1nations], they ought also in the fleshly things minister to them.

28. This then completing, and having sealed to them  this fruit, I will go forth by you into  Spain.

29. And I know that coming to you, [2in 3fullness 4of blessing 5of the 6good news 7of the 8Christ 1I shall come].

30. But I appeal to you, brethren, through  our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the spirit, to be companion at arms with me in the prayers for me to  God,

31. that I should be rescued from the ones resisting persuasion among the Jews; and that  my service, the one for Jerusalem, [2well-received 1should be] by the holy ones;

32. that in joy I should come to you by the will of God, that I should be refreshed together with you.

33. And the God  of peace be with you all. Amen.  

## Romans 16

1.  Greeting to the Assembly But I commend to you Phoebe  our sister, being a servant of the assembly, of the one in Cenchrea;
