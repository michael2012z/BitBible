# Job

## Job 1

1.  Job's Character and Possessions [2a certain man 1There was] in the land of Uz, Job was the name to him. And [2was  1that man] true, unblemished, [2man 1a sincere], and upright, and fearing  God, at a distance from every wicked thing.

2. And there were to him [2sons 1seven] and [2daughters 1three].

3. And [2were  1his animals] -- [2sheep 1seven thousand], [2camels 1three thousand], [2teams 3of oxen 1five hundred], and [4donkeys 3female 2grazing 1five hundred], and for service [2many 1exceedingly], and [3works 2great 1there were] of his upon the land. And [2was 1that man] great of the ones from [2sun 1the east].

4. [3going 1And  2his sons] to one another prepared a banquet, each  of his own day, taking along together also  [2three 3sisters 1their] to eat and to drink with them.

5. And whenever they completed the days of the banquet, Job sent and purified them, rising up in the morning, and offering for them a sacrifice according to  their number. [3said 1For 2Job], Lest at any time [2sinned 3and 4raved against 5God 6with 7their heart  1my sons]. Thus then Job did all the days. 

6.  The Devil Comes to The LORD And it came to pass  this day, and behold, [4came 1the 2sons  3of God] to stand before the lord, and the devil came in the midst of them.

7. And [3said 1the 2 lord] to the devil, From what place have you come? And [3answered 1the 2devil]  to the lord, and said, Going around the earth, and walking about the [2under 3heaven 1place at hand].

8. And [3said 4to him 1the 2 lord], Have you been attentive then in your consideration to  my attendant Job, that there is none likened to him of the ones upon the earth, [2man 1a blameless], a man sincere and upright and fearing  God, at a distance from every wicked thing?

9. [4answered 1And 2the 3devil], and said, Before the lord, does Job freely fear  God?

10. Have you not enclosed him, and the things inside  his household, and the things outside? And all of the things being to him round about -- the works  of his hands you blessed, and  [2his cattle 3many 1you made] upon the earth.

11. But send  your hand, and touch all which he has, and assuredly [2in 3your face 1he will rave] against you.

12. Then [3said 1the 2 lord] to the devil, Behold, all as much as is his I put into  your hand; but he himself you shall not touch. And [3went forth 1the 2devil] from the lord.

13. And it was on  this day the sons of Job and  his daughters were drinking wine in the house  [3brother 1of their  2elder]. 

14.  Job Loses His Children and Possessions And behold, a messenger came to Job, and said to him, The teams  of oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were grazing next to them.

15. And Sabeans fell upon and captured them, and the servants they killed by swords. [4escaped 1And 2I 3alone], and I came  to report to you.

16. Yet speaking this, there came another, and said to Job, Fire from  God fell from out of the heaven, and it incinerated the sheep; and the shepherds were devoured up in like manner; and having escaped, I alone came  to report to you.

17. While speaking this, there came another messenger, and said to Job, The Chaldeans put three companies, and encircled the camels, and captured them; and the servants they killed by swords, [4escaped 1and 2I 3alone], and I came  to report to you.

18. While this one was speaking, another messenger came, saying  to Job,  Your sons and  your daughters were eating and drinking with  [3brother 1their  2elder].

19. Suddenly [2wind 1a great] came upon them from out of the wilderness, and it touched the four corners of their house, and [3fell 1the 2house] upon  your children, and they came to an end; [4escaped 1and 2I 3alone], and I came  to report to you.

20. Thus rising up, Job tore up  his garments, and sheared the hair  of his head, and falling to the ground he did obeisance.

21. And said, I myself [2naked 1came forth] from out of [2belly 1my mother's], and naked I shall go forth there. The lord gave, the lord removed, as to the lord it seemed good, so also it came to pass. May [4be 1the 2name 3of the lord] blessed.

22. In all these things  coming to pass against him, in nothing Job sinned before the lord, and he imputed not folly to God.  

## Job 2

1.  The Devil Touches Job's Health And it came to pass as  this day occurred, and [4came 1the 2sons  3of God] to stand before the lord. And the devil came in the midst of them to stand before the lord.

2. And [3said 1the 2 lord] to the devil, From what place come you? Then [3said 1the 2devil] before the lord, Traveling over the place under heaven, and walking about  the whole the place at hand.

3. [4said 1And 2the 3 lord] to the devil, Have you taken heed then to my attendant Job, that there is not according to him of the ones upon the earth, a man not wicked, true, blameless, godly, and at a distance from all evil? But still he has innocence, but you spoke  [2his substance 3without cause 1to destroy].

4. [4undertaking 1But 2the 3devil], said to the lord, Skin for skin, and all as much as exists to a man [2for  3his life 1he will give].

5.  But in fact, but you send  your hand to touch  his bones and  his flesh, assuredly [2in 3your face 1he will rave].

6. [4said 1And 2the 3 lord] to the devil, Behold, I deliver him to you, only  [2his life 1you guard]!

7. And [3went forth 1the 2devil] from the lord, and smote  Job [2sore 1with a severe] from feet unto head.

8. And he took to himself a potsherd so as [2the 3pus 1to scrape]; and he sat down within the ashes.

9. And [2said 3to him  1his wife], Until how long will you persevere? But speak any word to God, and come to an end!

10. And he, looking to her said, Why as one of the foolish women did you speak? If [2the 3good things 1we looked for] from the hand of the lord, [3the 4bad 1shall we not 2endure]? In all these things, the ones coming to pass to him, not one thing Job sinned with his lips before the lord. 

11.  Job's Friends Comfort Him [5hearing 1And  3three 4friends 2his 7the 8bad things 6all]  coming upon him, came each from their own place to him. Eliphaz the Temanite -- a king, Baldad the Shuhite -- a sovereign, Zophar the Minaean -- a king. And they came to him with one accord  to comfort and visit him.

12. And seeing him at a distance, they did not recognize him. And they yelled [2voice 1with a great], and wept, [2tearing 1each]  his own apparel, and strewing earth.

13. And they sat beside him seven days and seven nights, and not one of them spoke to him a word; for they saw the [2calamity 1awful] being, and [2great 1it was exceedingly].  

## Job 3

1.  Job Curses the Day of His Birth And after this Job opened  his mouth and cursed  his day,

2. saying,

3. May [6be destroyed 1the 2day 3in 4which 5I was born], and the night in which they said, Behold, a male.

4.  [2that night 1May 3be] darkness, and [4not 1may 5search 7out 6it 2the 3 lord] from above, nor may [2come 3into 4it 1brightness].

5. [2may 7take 1But 8it 3darkness 4and 5the shadow 6of death]. May [2come 3upon 4it 1dimness]. And may [3be disturbed  2day 1that],

6. and  that night. May [2have carried 4away 3it 1darkness]. May it not be for the days of the year, nor may it be counted for the days of the months.

7. But  [2that night 1may] be grief, and may [2not 3come 4upon 5it 1gladness], nor a cause for joy.

8. But may [5curse 6it 1the 2one cursing  4day 3that], the ones being about to awaken  Leviathan.

9. May [4be enveloped in darkness 1the 2stars  3of that night], and not remain, and [3for 4illumination 1not 2come]. And may [3not 4be seen 2morning star 1the arising].

10. For it did not close up the gates [2womb 1of my mother's], [3dismissed 1for 2it would have] misery from my eyes.

11. For why in the belly did I not come to an end? [3from 4the womb 1But instead 2I came forth], and was not straightway destroyed?

12. And why did [3meet 4me 1the 2knees]? And why did [2on the breasts 1I nurse].

13. Now going to bed I should be stilled; and having slept rested;

14. with the kings, the counselors of the earth, who prance with swords;

15. or with rulers, whose [2was abundant  1gold], who filled  their houses with silver.

16. Or as if a miscarriage going forth from out of [2womb 1a mother's], or as infants who beheld not light.

17. There the impious ceased the rage of anger; there [3are rested 1the exhausted  2in body].

18. But with one accord the ones being bound do not hear the voice of the tribute-gatherer.

19. Small and great are there, even the attendant being in awe  of his master.

20. For why has [2been given 3to the ones 4in 5bitterness 1light], and life to the [2in 3griefs 1souls]?

21. the ones who long for  death, and do not attain; rooting it up as if for treasures;

22. [3overjoyed 1and 2they become] if they should attain it. Death to a man is rest.

23. [4not 1The 2way 3was] concealed, [3hemmed in 1for  2God] against him.

24. [5before 1For  6my grain 2moaning 3comes 4to me], and shall be poured as waters roaring.

25. For the fear which I thought about, came to me; and which I had in awe, met with me.

26. Neither was I at peace, nor still, nor I rested; [3came 1but 4to me 2wrath].  

## Job 4

1.  Eliphaz Blames Job's Trials on Sin And undertaking, Eliphaz the Temanite says,

2. If we take to speak to you, will you tire? But the strength of your words, who shall endure?

3. For since you admonished many, and [2the hands 3of the weak 1comforted],

4. [3the ones being weak 1and also 2raised up] with words, [5in knees 1and 4to the ones powerless 3courage 2you invested],

5. but now [2comes 3upon 4you 1misery], and touched you; and now you are hurried.

6. Is it not that your fear is in folly, and  your hope, and the evil  of your way?

7. Do you remember then who being pure was destroyed? or when the true ones [2entirely from the root 1were destroyed]?

8. As in which manner I beheld the ones plowing the unnatural places, then the ones sowing them [2griefs 1shall harvest] for themselves.

9. By the order of the lord they shall perish, and by the breath of his anger they shall be obliterated.

10. The strength of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the prancing of dragons shall be extinguished.

11. The small lion is destroyed by  not having game; and the cubs of lions forsook one another.

12. [2to 3me 1And] it was spoken clandestinely in stealth; shall not [3receive 1my  2ear] extraordinary things by him,

13. in amazement from [3vision 1my 2nightly] falling fear upon men?

14. But a shuddering awe met with me, and trembling, and [4greatly 1my  2bones 3quaked].

15. And a spirit [2upon 3my face 1came], [6shuddered 1and 2my 3hair 4and 5flesh].

16. I rose up, and knew not; I saw and [3no 2was 1there] appearance before my eyes, but only a breeze; and [2a voice 1I heard], saying,

17. For what, Shall [3pure 2be 1a mortal] before the lord? or [3from  4his works 2be blameless 1shall a man]?

18. If [2even 4his servants 1he does not 3trust], and even considers his angels as crooked in what he thinks about,

19. then the ones dwelling in houses of clay, of whom also we [2from out of 3the 4same 5mortar 1are] -- he smites them [2of a moth 1in the manner].

20. And from morning until evening [2no longer 1they are]; by their not being able [3themselves 1to help themselves 2they] perish.

21. You raised up together  their vestige in them; they perished by  [2not 3having 1their] wisdom.  

## Job 5

1.  Eliphaz Continues to Speak But call, if any one will hearken to you; or if [2any 4angels 3holy 1you shall see].

2. For even [3a fool 2does away with 1anger], [4one having wandered 1and 3puts to death 2zeal].

3. And I have seen fools [2root 1laying]; and I cursed  their attractiveness immediately.

4. [4at a distance 1May 3be  2their sons] from safety, and they shall be crushed at the doors of lesser men, and there shall not be  one rescuing.

5. [3which 1For 2those things] they harvested, one hungering shall eat; but they [2to 3ones armed 1shall be carried]; may [3be siphoned off 1their  2strength].

6. [4not 1For 3can 5come forth 6out of 7the 8earth 2toil], nor [3from 4the mountains 2sprout up 1shall misery].

7. But a man is born to toil, and the young eagles [2the 3high places 1to fly];

8. [2nevertheless 1but] I shall beseech of the lord, [3the lord 1and 4the 5master of all 2I shall call upon],

9. the one doing great things, and untraceable, honorable things also, and extraordinary, which there is no number;

10. the one giving rain upon the earth, sending water upon the places under heaven;

11. the one appointing the humble unto the height, and [2the ones perishing 1raising up],

12. effacing counsels of clever ones, that in no way should [2perform  1their hands] true;

13. the one overtaking the wise with the intellect; and the counsel of the crafty ones he amazes.

14. By day [2shall meet 3them 1darkness],  and at midday may they grope equally as at night.

15. And may they perish in war; and may the powerless come forth from out of the hand of the mighty one.

16. And may there be [2to the poor 1hope]; [4of the unjust 1but 3the mouth 2may] be obstructed.

17. And blessed is the man whom [3reproved 1the 2 lord], [4the admonition 1and 5of the almighty 2does not 3refuse].

18. For he [2one to ache 1causes], and again he restores; he smites, and  his hands heal.

19. Six times [2from out of 3your distresses 1he rescues you], and in the seventh time in no way will he touch you for bad.

20. In famine, he will rescue you from death, [2in 3war 1and 6from out of 7the hand 8of iron 4he will untie 5you].

21. [2from 3the whip 4of the tongue 1He shall hide you], and in no way shall you be fearful from [2evils 1the coming].

22. The unjust and lawless you shall ridicule, and from [2beasts 1wild] in no way shall you be fearful;

23. for the beasts of the wild shall make peace with you.

24. Then you shall know that [3shall be at peace 1your  2house]; and he shall visit your beauty, and in no way should it have sinned.

25. And you shall know that [2shall be many  1your seed], and your progeny will be as the abundant herbage of the field.

26. And you shall come unto the grave as grain in season, according to the time of harvesting; or as a heap of the threshing-floor according to the hour of its being collected.

27. Behold, these things thus we tracked out, these things are what we have heard; but you, know in yourself if you acted in anything!  

## Job 6

1.  Job Laments His Affliction And undertaking, Job says,

2. For if anyone stationing weight would set my  wrath, and [3griefs 2my 1lift] onto a yoke balance scale, they would be in one accord.

3. For indeed of the sand of the coast it will be heavier; upon this  my sayings were trampled.

4. For arrows of the worthy one [2in  3my body 1are], which  their rage drinks up my  blood. Whenever I begin to speak, they sting me.

5. For what -- will [3ineffectually 4cry out 2donkey 1the wild] if he is not  [2grain 1seeking], no. And shall then [3tear loose 1the voice 2of the ox] at the stable while having  foods, no.

6. Shall [2be eaten 1bread] without salt, no. and is there taste in [2words 1empty], no.

7. [4is not 5able 1For 2my 6to cease  3soul]; for groaning I see  my grain as the scent of a lion.

8. For if only he might give and [3might come 1my  2requests], and that  [4my hope 3might grant 1the 2 lord].

9. Beginning, [2the 3 lord 1let] pierce; [5unto 6the end 1but 3me not 2let 4be done away with]!

10. [2may 4be 1But 5my 6city 3the grave], upon [2of which 4upon 1the walls 3I leaped]; upon it I shall not spare; [3not 1for 2I lied] about [2sayings 1the holy] of my God.

11. For what is my  strength, that I remain? or what is my  time, that [3endures 1my  2soul]?

12. Is [2the strength 3of stones  1my strength]? or  [2my flesh members 1are] of brass?

13. Or not upon him to yield? but help [2from 3me 1was departed];

14. [2is forbidden 3me 1mercy]; and the visit of the lord overlooked me.

15. [2looked not at 3me  1My brothers]; [3as if 4a rushing stream 5dissipating 6or 7as if 8a wave 1they went by 2me].

16. The ones who revered me, now fall upon me as if snow or ice banked up,

17. and as the melting away [2of heat 1by the coming], it was not recognized of where it was.

18. So I also was left by all; and I am destroyed, and [2homeless 1I became].

19. Behold the ways of the Temanites, [3the short cuts 4of the Sabaeans 1O ones 2seeing clearly].

20. And for shame they shall owe -- the ones in cities and the things relied upon there.

21. But nevertheless, even you mounted against me mercilessly; so that beholding  my wound you are fearful.

22. For what -- [2anything 3of you 1did I ask], or  [3from 4you 2strength 1do I want],

23. so as to deliver me from enemies, or [3from out of 4the hand 5of mighty ones 1to rescue 2me]?

24. Teach me, and I will be silent! If in anything I have wandered, expound to me!

25. But as it seems, [3are vile 2of a true man 1the words]; [3not 1for 6from 7you 5strength 2I do 4ask].

26. Nor  will your reproof [2my words 1cause me to cease]; for neither your utterance of a word will I endure.

27. Besides that, [2upon 3an orphan 1you fall], and you assail against your friend.

28. But now, having looked into your faces, I will not lie.

29. Sit indeed, and may there not be anything unjust, and again [2with the 3just 1come together]!

30. [3no 1For 2there is 5on 6my tongue 4unjust thing]; or, does not  my throat meditate on understanding?  

## Job 7

1.  Job Questions His Existence In either way [2not 9a trial 1is 3the 4existence 5of man 6upon 7the 8earth], and [2as 4hireling 3the daily  1his life],

2. or as an attendant in awe  of his master, and attaining for shade; or as if a hireling awaiting  his wage?

3. So I also waited months in vain; and nights of griefs [2given 3to me 1are].

4. When I should go to bed, I say, When will it be the day? and whenever I rise up, again I say, When will it be evening? [3full 1And 2I am] of griefs, from evening unto morning.

5. [4is befouled 1And 2my  3body] in rottenness of worms, and I melt away with clods of earth [2of 3pus 1scraping].

6. And my existence is lighter than speech, and has perished in vain hope.

7. Remember then that my breath  is life; and no longer shall [2return back 1my eye] to behold good.

8. [4shall not look round about 1The eye 2of the one seeing 3me];  your eyes are on me, and I am not.

9. I am as a cloud being cleared away from the heaven; for if a man should go down into Hades, no longer in any way should he ascend;

10. and neither in any way shall he return unto  his own house, nor [3in any way 1shall 4recognize 5him 6any more  2his place].

11. Nevertheless then, nor will I spare  my mouth; I will speak [2in 3distress 1being]  of my spirit; I will open the bitterness of my soul being held in.

12. Is it that I am a sea or a dragon, that you delegated [2over 3me 1a guard]?

13. I said that [2shall comfort 3me  1my bed], and I shall offer to myself my own word  in my bed.

14. You frighten me with dreams, and with visions you strike terror in me.

15. You will dismiss [2from 3my spirit  1my soul], [3from 1and 4death  2my bones].

16. [3not 1For 5into 6the 7eon 2I shall 4live], that I should patiently wait. Depart from me, [4is empty 1for 2my  3livelihood]!

17. For what is man that you magnified him? or that you heed the mind in him?

18. Or [2him a visit 1will you make] until the morning; and [2for 3rest 1shall you judge him]?

19. For how long do you not allow me, nor let me go, until whenever I should swallow down  my spittle in grief?

20. If I sinned, how am I able [2against you 1to act out], O one having knowledge of the mind  of men? Why did you establish me as your accuser, and I am [2unto 3you 1a load]?

21. And why did you not appoint  of my lawlessness to forgetfulness, and for a cleansing  of my sin? But now into the earth I shall go forth, [4for rising early 1and 3no longer 2I am].  

## Job 8

1.  Baldad Implies Job has Sinned And undertaking, Baldad the Shuhite, says,

2. Till when shall you speak these things [2spirit 1by a talkative]  of your mouth?

3. Will the lord transgress judging? or the one  making all things disturb the just?

4. If  your sons sin before him, he sent them away in hand because of their lawlessness.

5. But you, rise early to the lord almighty beseeching him!

6. If you are pure and true, [3supplication 1he will heed 2your], and he will restore to you the habitation of righteousness.

7. It will be then that as your first shall be little,  yet your last will be an untold amount.

8. For ask [2generation 1the first], and trace according to the race of the fathers!

9. [3of yesterday 1For 2we are], and have not known; [8a shadow 1for 2our 7is  3existence 4upon 5the 6earth];

10.  shall these not teach you, and announce to you, and from out of the heart lead forth sayings?

11. Does [2flourish 1papyrus] without water? or shall [2rise up high 1the flowering rush] without drinking?

12. Yet being upon the root, and in no way harvested, [3before 4the 5drinking 6of all 7pasturage 1shall it not 2be dried]?

13. So therefore will it be for the last of all the ones forgetting the lord; for the hope of the impious shall perish.

14. [5uninhabited 1For 2his 4will be  3house], [5as for 6a spider 1and 2his 4will turn out to be  3tent].

15. If one should overlook  his house, in no way shall it stand; and grasping it, in no way shall it remain.

16. [3wet 1For 2it is] under the sun, and [3out of 4his rottenness  1his tender branch 2shall come forth].

17. Upon a gathering of stones he goes to bed, and in the midst of gravel he shall live.

18. And if [3should swallow him 1the 2place], it shall lie to him, saying, Have you not seen such a thing?

19. For the undoing of the impious is such, and from out of the earth another shall sprout up.

20.  For the lord in no way will undo the guileless, and every gift of the impious he will not receive.

21. [3of the true ones 1But 2the mouth] he will fill with laughter,  and their lips with acknowledgment.

22.  But their enemies shall put on shame; and the habitation of the impious will not be.  

## Job 9

1.  Job Responds to Baldad And undertaking, Job says,

2. In truth I know that it is so; for how shall there be a just mortal before the lord?

3. For if he should want to enter into judgment with him, in no way shall God obey him, so that he shall not contradict with one word of his from out of a thousand.

4. [3wise 1For 2he is] in thought, fortified also, and great. Who [2hard 1being] before him even made peace?

5. The [2of old 1mountains] even do not know the one eradicating them in anger.

6. The one shaking the thing under heaven from its foundations, and the columns of it shake.

7. The one speaking to the sun, and it does not rise; and accordingly [2the stars 1he seals up].

8. The one stretching the heaven alone, and walking [3as 4upon 5a floor 1upon 2the sea].

9. The one making Pleiades and Hesperus and Arcturus, and the chambers of the south.

10. The one doing great and untraceable things; honorable also, and extraordinary things which there is no number.

11. If he should pass over me, in no way shall I behold it; and if he should go by me, neither thus I knew it.

12. If he dismisses, who returns? or who shall say to him, What did you do?

13.  God will not turn away the anger, [2under 3him 1but 7were bent 4the whales  5under 6heaven].

14. But then should he obey me, or shall he litigate  my things?

15. [2even if 1For 4just 3I should be] shall he listen not to me?  his equity I will beseech.

16. And if I should call and he should hearken, I do not trust that he has listened to my  voice.

17. [2not 4by dimness 1He should 3obliterate me]; but many of my  bruises he has made without cause.

18. [4not 2he allows 1For 3me] to breathe, and he filled me with bitterness.

19. For indeed by strength he prevails; who then [2his judgment 1shall oppose]?

20. For if I might be just,  my mouth will be impious; and though I might be blameless, [2perverse 1I shall turn out].

21. For whether I was impious, I do not know in soul; besides, [2is removed 3from me  1life].

22. Therefore I said, [2the great 3and 4mighty one 1he destroys] in wrath.

23. For the vile [2in 3death 1are extraordinary], but the just are ridiculed.

24. For they are delivered into the hands of the impious; [2the faces 3of her judges 1he covers up]; but if not he, who is it?

25.  But my existence is lighter than a runner; my days ran away, and they knew it not.

26. Or also is there [2of ships 1a trace] in the way? or a trace of an eagle flying seeking prey?

27. For if also I said, I shall forget about speaking, I will stoop down  my countenance and I will moan.

28. I shake in all  my limbs, for I know that [2not 4me be innocent 1you will 3let].

29. But since I am impious, for why is this [2in vain 1I labor]?

30. For if I should wash myself off with snow, and should clear away my hands clean,

31. fittingly in my filth you dipped me; [3abhorred 1and 4me  2my apparel].

32. [3not 1For 2you are] a man like me, with whom I can judge by comparison, that we should come with one accord for judgment.

33. If indeed [2was present  1our mediator], and the one reproving, and the one hearing between both,

34. let him dismiss [3from 4me 1the 2rod], [3the 1and 4fear 5of him 2let not] whirl about,

35. and in no way shall I fear, but I will speak, for I am not thus conscious of guilt.  

## Job 10

1.  Job Claims Innocence Being weary in my soul, in moaning I will let loose upon myself  my sayings; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul, being constrained.

2. And I will say to the lord, [3not 2me 4to be impious 1Teach]! and why [3me 1have you so 2judged]?

3. Or is it good to you that I should transgress? that I should forbid the works of your hands? [3the counsel 1and 4of the impious 2did you heed]?

4. Or as a mortal sees -- do you look? or as [2sees 1a man] -- shall you see?

5. Or  your existence -- is it mankind? or  your years -- a man's?

6. For you searched out  my lawlessnesses, and  [2my sins 1you traced].

7. For you know that I did not act impious; but who is the one [2from out of 3your hands 1rescuing]?

8.  Your hands shaped me and made me; after these things in turning you smote me.

9. Remember that [2of clay 1you shaped me], and unto the earth [3me 1again 2you return].

10. Or [2not 5as 6milk 4me 1did you 3extract], and curdled me equal to cheese?

11. But skin and meat you put on me, and with bones and nerves you entwined me.

12. And life and mercy you put upon me,  and by your overseeing you guarded my  spirit.

13. Having these things in yourself, I know that [2all things 1you are able to do]; [3is impossible 1and 4with you 2not one thing].

14. For if I should sin, you guard me; but from lawlessness [2not 5innocent 4me 1you have 3appointed].

15. For if I should be impious, alas; but if I might be just, I am not able to lift up the head, [3full 1for 4of dishonor 2I am].

16. For I am caught as a lion for slaughter; and again in turning [3awfully 2me 1you destroy];

17. renewing upon me  my chastisement; [4anger 1and 3in great 2you dealt with me], and you brought [2against 3me 1trials].

18. Why then in the belly did you lead me out, and I did not die, that an eye [3me 1did not 2see],

19. and that [2as if 3one not 4being 1I became]? For why [3from 4the womb 5unto 6the tomb 1was I not 2dismissed]?

20. Or [2not 6little 1is 3the 4time  5of my existence]? Allow me to rest a little!

21. before  my going from where I shall not return, unto a land dark and dim;

22. unto a land [2darkness 1of eternal], where there is no brightness, nor seeing the life of mortals.  

## Job 11

1.  Sophar Claims Job's Afflictions Are Deserved And undertaking, Sophar the Minean says,

2. The one  [2many things 1saying] also shall listen in turn; or does the well-spoken imagine himself to be just? Blessed be the one born of woman short-lived.

3. [2not 3many 4in 5words 1Become]; [3no one 1for 2there is]  judging you by comparison.

4. For do not say that, I am pure  in works, and blameless before him.

5. But how ever is the lord to speak to you, and open his lips with you;

6. then he shall announce to you the power of wisdom, that it will be double to the things of yours? And then you shall know that what is worthy to you resulted from the lord whom you have sinned.

7. Or [2the trace 3of the lord 1will you find]? or [2unto 3the 4latter end 1did you arrive] which [3prepared 1the 2almighty]?

8. [2is high  1Heaven], and what will you do? And there are deeper things than in Hades, what do you know?

9. or longer than the measure of the earth, or the breadth of the sea.

10. And if he shall eradicate all things, who will say to him, What did you do?

11. For he knows the works of the lawless; and beholding [3the things out of place 1he shall not 2overlook].

12. But man otherwise shall be over-confident with words; but a mortal born of a woman is equal [2donkey 1to a recluse].

13. For if you [3clean 1established  2your heart], and turned up and opened your hands to him;

14. if [3lawless thing 2any 1there is] in your hands, [3to be at a distance 1cause 2it]! [3injustice 1and 5in 6your habitation 2let not 4lodge]!

15. For thus [3shall illuminate 1your  2face] as if [2water 1pure]; and you shall strip off filth, and in no way shall you be fearful.

16. And  [2trouble 1you shall forget] as a wave going by; and you shall not be terrified.

17.  And your vow will be as the morning star; and from midday [2shall arise 3to you 1life].

18. [3complying 1And 2you shall be], for it is hope to you; and from anxiety and bewilderment [2shall appear 3to you 1peace].

19. For you shall be tranquil, and there will not be  one waging war against you; and turning, many will beseech you.

20. But deliverance shall leave them,  for their hope is destruction; and the eyes of the impious shall melt away.  

## Job 12

1.  Job Reproves His Friends And undertaking, Job says,

2. So then you are men, then [3with 4you 2comes to an end 1wisdom]?

3. [2also to me 3indeed 4a heart 5like 6yours 1There is].

4. For a just man, and blameless, was born for an object for taunts.

5. [2at 4time 1For 3an appointed] man had been prepared to fall under others; [3house 1also for 2his] to be pillaged by lawless ones. But let not however any one [3rely on 2wicked 1being] he shall be considered innocent;

6. as many as provoke [3to anger 1the 2 lord], as if [2not 4also 5their chastisement 1there will 3be].

7. But indeed ask the four-footed beasts! if they should speak to you, or birds of the heaven, if they were able to report to you.

8. [2let 4tell in detail 1And 3the earth]! if it should expound to you; and [5shall describe 6to you 1the 2fishes 3of the 4sea].

9. Who knew not among all these, that the hand of the lord made these?

10. Except in his hand is the life of all the living, and the breath of every man.

11. [2the ear 3indeed 1For 5words 4scrutinizes], and the throat [2grains 1tastes].

12. In a long time is wisdom; and in a long existence is higher knowledge.

13. By him is wisdom and power; with him counsel and understanding.

14. If he should throw down, who shall build up? If he locks against man, who opens?

15. If he should restrain the water, he shall dry the earth; and if he should let it loose, he destroys it by eradication.

16. By him is might and strength; in him is higher knowledge and understanding,

17. leading counselors as captives; and judges of the earth he amazes;

18. sitting kings upon thrones, and ties a belt on their loins;

19. sending priests as captives; and the mighty ones of the earth he eradicates;

20. reconciling the lips of the trustworthy; [2the understanding 1and] of the elders he knew;

21. pouring out dishonor upon rulers, but the humble he healed;

22. uncovering the deeps from out of darkness, and he leads [3into 4light 1the shadow 2of death];

23. wandering nations, and destroying them; prostrating nations, and directing them;

24. reconciling the hearts of the rulers of the earth, but wandering them in the way which they do not know.

25. May they handle darkness, and not light; may they be wandering as if one being intoxicated.  

## Job 13

1.  Job's Reproof Behold, [4these things 3has seen 1my  2eye], and [2has heard  1my ear].

2. And I know as much as even you know; and [2not 3more senseless 1I am] than you.

3. But nevertheless, I [2to 3the lord 1will speak]; and I will reprove before him, if he should be willing.

4. But you are [2physicians 1unjust], and [3healers 2bad 1are all].

5. But it may be good for you to be silent, and it shall turn out to you for wisdom.

6. Hear the reproof of my mouth; [3the judgment 1and 4of my lips 2heed]!

7. Is it not against the lord you speak, and before him you utter a sound of deceit?

8. Or will you keep back? But you yourselves [2judges 1become]!

9. Is it good if he should track you; for as if [2all things 1the ones doing] shall you be added to him;

10. in not one thing less shall he reprove you; but if also [2secretly 4at persons 1you shall 3wonder].

11. Is it not  in his awfulness that he shall whirl you, and fear of him shall fall upon you?

12. [4shall turn out 1But 2your  3prancing] equal to ashes, and the body to clay.

13. Be silent, that I shall speak, and rest my rage!

14. Taking  my flesh in my teeth, [4life 1even 3my 2I shall put] in my hand.

15. Though [4me 3should lay hands against 1the 2mighty one], since even he begins,  in fact I shall speak and reprove before him.

16. And this [4to me 1shall result 2in 3deliverance]; [4not 1for 6before 7him 2treachery 3shall 5enter].

17. Hear, hear  my words! for I will announce in your hearing.

18. Behold, I am near  my judgment; I know that [2just 1I shall appear].

19. For who is the one passing judgment to me, that now I shall be silent and shall cease?

20. But two things you shall furnish to me, then from  your presence I will not hide.

21. Let your hand [2from 3me 1be at a distance]! and [3in the 4fear 5of you 1let me not 2be struck with terror]!

22. Then you shall call, and I will hearken to you; or you shall speak, and I will give you an answer.

23. How many are  my sins, and  my lawless deeds? Teach me what they are!

24. Why [2from 3me 1do you hide]; and esteem me contrary to you?

25. Or as a leaf moving by the wind, will you be cautious of me? or as grass borne by the wind, will you be adverse to me?

26. For you wrote down against me bad things, and you invested to me youthful sin.

27. And you put my  foot under restraint; and you watched all my  works; and into the roots of my feet you attained.

28. I am the one turning old equal to a leather bag, or as [2garment 1a moth-eaten].  

## Job 14

1.  Life Is Short and Full of Wrath For a mortal born of a woman is short-lived and full of wrath.

2. Or as the flower blooming he falls off; and he runs away as a shadow, and in no way stands.

3. Have you not also [2an account of this one 1made], and made this one to enter before you in judgment?

4. For who will be clean from filth? but no one;

5. if even [2be one 3day  1his existence] upon the earth, [3are counted 1and 2his months] by you. [2for 3a time 1You appointed him], and in no way shall he pass beyond.

6. Separate from him! that he should be still, and he shall think well of the existence as the hireling.

7. For there is [2for a tree 1hope]; for if it should be cut down, still it will bloom again, and  its tender branch in no way shall fail;

8. for if [2should grow old 3in 4the earth  1its root], [4in 1and 5the rock 3should come to an end  2its trunk];

9. from the scent of water it shall bloom, and shall produce a harvest as if newly planted.

10. But a man coming to an end is undone; [3falling 1and 2a mortal] is no longer.

11. For in time [2is depleted 1a sea], and a river being made desolate is dried up.

12. But man going to sleep shall certainly not rise up, until whenever the heaven in no way shall be sewn together, and they shall not wake up from their sleep.

13. For ought in Hades you guarded me, and hid me until whenever [3should cease 1your  2anger]; and should have ordered for me a time in which [2mention 3of me 1you shall make].

14. For if [2should die 1a man], shall he live again having completed the days  of his existence? I shall wait until [2again 1I should exist].

15. Then you shall call, and I will hearken to you; but the works  of your hands do not undo.

16. But you counted my  practices, and in no way shall there go by you even one  of my sins.

17. And you set a seal upon my  lawless deeds in a bag, and marked if in anything [2unwillingly 1I violated].

18. And moreover a mountain falling shall fall into ruin, and a rock shall be worn old from out of  its place.

19. [3stones smooth 2ground 1Waters], and [2flooded 1waters] the steeps of the embankment of the earth; and [2the endurance 3of man 1you destroyed].

20. You thrust him through unto the end, and he is undone; you set [2against him  1your face], and send him out.

21. And though there are many [2being born  1of his sons], he knows it not; if also [2few 1they become], he knows not.

22. But  his flesh aches,  and his soul mourns.  

## Job 15

1.  Job Held Liable for His Words And undertaking, Eliphaz the Temanite says,

2. Is it that a wise man [2an answer 1will give] of an understanding spirit, and filled up the misery of the womb,

3. reproving in sayings [3in which 4must not be spoken 1with 2words], in which no one benefits?

4. And did you not undo fear, and complete [2sayings 1such] before the lord?

5. You are liable by the sayings of your mouth, of which you litigated sayings of mighty ones.

6. May [3reprove 4you  1your 2mouth], and not I.  And your lips, may they bear witness against you.

7. For what, are you the first man born? or [2before 3the hills 1were you banked up]?

8. [2the arranged order 3of the lord 1have you heard]? and unto you [2arrived 1wisdom]?

9. For what do you know, which we do not know? or what do you perceive, which [2do not 3also 1we]?

10. And indeed an elder, and indeed an old one is among us, more weighty than  your father, in days.

11. [2but little 3for 4your sins 1You have been whipped], but greatly above measure have you spoken.

12. What did [2dare  1your heart]? or what have [2added to see  1your eyes],

13. that your rage tore before the lord, and [3led forth 4from out of 5your mouth 2sayings 1such]?

14. For who, being a mortal, still will be blameless? or [3as 4being 5just 1who is born 2of a woman]?

15. forasmuch as [2the holy ones 1he trusts not], and the heaven is not pure before him.

16. Alas then, [2is abhorrent 3and 4unclean 1man], drinking iniquity equal to a beverage.

17. But I will report to you, hear me! What indeed I have seen, I will report to you --

18. what the wise men shall say, and what was not hidden from their fathers.

19. To them alone [3was given 1the 2earth], and no [2came 1foreigner] upon them.

20. All the existence of the impious is spent in bewilderment; and the years [3are counted 1being given 2to the mighty one],

21.  and his fear is in his ears. Whenever the impious should seem already at peace, [3shall come 1his  2undoing].

22. Let him not trust to return from darkness, for he has been given charge already unto the hands of iron.

23. And he has been delegated for the grain of vultures, and he knows in himself that he waits for being a corpse; [3day 1and 2a dark] shall whirl him away.

24. And distress and affliction shall hold him down. [2is as 3a commandant 4of the front rank 1His falling down].

25. For he has lifted hands against the lord, and before the almighty he stiffened his neck.

26. And he ran against his insolence with the thickness of the back of his shield.

27. For he covered  his face with his fat, and made a cleft upon the thighs.

28. And may he be lodged [2cities 1in desolate], and enter [2houses 1uninhabited]; and what these prepared, others shall carry away.

29. Nor shall he be enriched, nor shall [3remain 1his  2possessions]; in no way shall he cast [2upon 3the earth 1a shadow].

30. Neither shall he flee from the darkness;  [4his bud 1may 3wither 2wind], [2may 5fall off 1and 3his  4flower].

31. Let him not trust that he will remain behind, for emptiness shall result to him.

32.  His pruning [2before 3its season 1shall be corrupted], and  his tender branch in no way shall become dense.

33. And may he be gathered as an unripe grape before its season; and may he fall off as the flower of the olive.

34. [3is the testimony 1For 4of an impious man 2death], and fire shall burn the houses of the ones taking bribes.

35. [4in 5the womb 1And 2he shall conceive 3griefs], and there shall result unto him emptiness,  and his belly shall endure deceit.  

## Job 16

1.  Job's Friends Are Bad Comforters And undertaking, Job says,

2. I have heard [2such things 1many]. [3comforters 2bad 1You are all].

3. For what,  [2order 1is there] in words of wind? or what shall it trouble you that you answer?

4. I also [2as 3you 1could speak] if [3laid 1indeed  2your life] instead of  my life. So then I shall assail against you with words, and I will shake [2as 3you 1my head].

5. And may that there be strength in  my mouth, [4the movement 1then 5of my lips 2I would not 3spare].

6. For if I shall speak [2shall not 3ache  1my wound]; and if also I keep silent, how less will I be pierced?

7. But now, [2me exhausted 1he has made], [2moron 1a festering], and it took hold of me.

8. For [2a testimony 1I became], and [2rose up 3in 4me  1my lie]; according to my face it was answered.

9. In anger the one dealing with me cast me down; he gnashed against me with his teeth; the arrows of his marauders [2upon 3me 1have fallen];

10. [3points 4of his eyes 1he assailed me 2with the sharp]; he smote me onto my knees; and with one accord they ran upon me.

11. [4delivered 1For 5me 2the 3 lord] into the hands of the unjust, and unto the impious he tossed me.

12. Making peace he effaced me; taking me by the hair of the head he plucked it out; he placed me as if an exemplar.

13. They encircled me with lances, casting into my kidney, not sparing; they poured out [2onto 3the 4earth  1my bile].

14. They threw me down, downfall upon downfall; they ran against me prevailing;

15. [2sackcloth 1they sewed] upon my hide;  and my strength [2in 3the ground 1was extinguished].

16.  My belly burns from weeping, and upon my eyelids a shadow of death.

17. [4unjust thing 1And 3not one 2there was] in my hands, [3vow 1and 2my] is pure.

18. O earth, you should not cover over the blood  of my flesh, nor may there be a place  for my cry.

19. And now behold, [2is in 3the heavens  1my witness],  and my joint witness is in the highest.

20. May [3arrive 1my  2supplication] unto the lord, and before him may [3drip tears 1my  2eye].

21. And may it be reproof to man before the lord, and to a son of man to his neighbor.

22. [3years 1But 2counted] have come; and in the way in which I shall not be returned -- I shall go.  

## Job 17

1.  Job Loathes His Life I am destroyed, [2by a wind 1being borne]; and I beseech a burial, and attain it not.

2. [2I implore 1In wearying], for what shall I do? [3stole 1and 4my  5possessions 2strangers].

3. Who is this to my hand tied together?

4. For [2their heart 1you hid] from intellect; on account of this, in no way shall you exalt them.

5.  [3in portion 1He shall announce 2evils]; and eyes upon sons were melted away.

6. But you appointed me for a common topic among the nations, [3as laughter 1and 4for them 2I resulted].

7. [3are calloused 1For 4from 5wrath  2my eyes]; I have been assaulted greatly by all.

8. Wonder held true men over these things; [3the just 1and 5against 6the lawbreaker 2may 4rise up].

9. [2may 4hold 1But 3the trustworthy]  his own way; [3the clean 1and 4hands 2may] take courage.

10. But however, let all be established and come indeed! [3not 1for 2I do 4find] among you a true one.

11.  My days go by in groaning, [5were torn 1and 2the 3articulations  4of my heart].

12. [2night 3for 4day 1I put]; the light is near from the face of darkness.

13. For if I remain, Hades is my  house; and in dimness I will make my  strewn bed.

14. [2death 1I called upon 4father 3to be my]; [5mother 1and 4my 3to be 6and 7sister 2rottenness].

15. Where then is my  hope? or  [2my good 1shall I see]?

16. or [2with 3me 4into 5Hades 1will they go down]? or with one accord [2unto 3the embankment 1shall we go down]?  

## Job 18

1.  Baldad's Discourse on the Impious And undertaking, Baldad the Shuhite says,

2. Until when will you cease? Wait! that also [2to these things 1we should speak].

3. Why as if four-footed beasts do we keep silent before you?

4. [2has dealt with 3you 1Anger]. For what if you should die, will it be uninhabited  under heaven? or shall [2be eradicated 1mountains] from their foundations?

5. But the light of the impious shall be extinguished, and [3shall not turn out to be 1their  2flame];

6.  his light will be darkness in his habitation, and the lamp over him shall be extinguished.

7. May [2hunt 1the least of men]  his possessions; [2may 5trip him 1and 3his  4counsel].

8. [2may 4be put 1And  3his foot] in a snare; [2in 3a net 1may he be coiled];

9. and may there come upon him snares; [2shall grow strong 3against 4him 1ones thirsting].

10. [2is hidden 3in 4the 5earth 1His line], and the thing seizing him is upon the roads.

11. [5round about 1May 3destroy 4him 2griefs], [3many things 1and 5around 6his foot 2may 4come].

12. [2in 3hunger 5severe 6downfall 1But 8for him 7is prepared 4an extraordinary].

13. And may [3be devoured 1the soles of his 2feet], [3shall devour 1and 4his  5beautiful things 2death].

14. [2may 4be torn 1And 5from 6his habitation 3healing]; and may he have himself distress by reason of a royal decree.

15. It shall encamp in  his tent in his night; [2shall be scattered  1his beautiful things] with sulphur.

16. [3from beneath  1His roots 2shall be dried], and on top [2shall fall 1his harvest].

17.  [2his memorial 1May] be destroyed from the earth, and what exists to his name upon the face outer.

18. May one thrust him from light unto darkness; and from the inhabitable world they displaced him.

19. He will not be well known among his people, nor [2be preserved 3in 4the place 5under 6heaven  1will his house].

20. But in  his house [2shall live 1others]; [3for 4him 2moaned 1the last], and the first had wonder.

21. These are the houses of the unjust, and this is the place of the ones not knowing the lord.  

## Job 19

1.  Job Questions The LORD And undertaking, Job says,

2. For how long [3weary 1will you make  2my soul], and demolish me with words? Know only! that  the lord did thus with me.

3. You speak ill of me; not being ashamed by me, you press upon me.

4. Yes indeed, in truth I was misled, [4in 5me 1and 3lodges 2delusion], to speak a word which must not be said;  but my words mislead, and are not in time.

5. But alas, for [2against 3me 1you magnify yourselves], and you assail me in scorn.

6. Know then! that the lord is the one disturbing; [3fortress 1and 2his 5against 6me 4he raised up high].

7. Behold, I laugh at scorn, and I shall not speak; I shall have cried out, and not at all is there judgment.

8. [2round about 1I have been enclosed], and in no way shall I pass over; [3upon 4my face 2darkness 1he put].

9. And the glory of mine [2from 3me 1he took off], and removed the crown from my head.

10. He pulled me apart round about, and I am set out; and he cut down [2as if 3a tree  1my hope].

11. [4awfully 1And 3me 5in anger 2he treated], and he led me as if an enemy.

12. And with one accord [2came  1his marauders] against me; in my ways [2encircled 3me 1ones lying in wait].

13. [4me 2brothers 1My 3left]; they know strangers rather than me; [3friends 1and 2my 5unmerciful 4have become].

14. [5not to know 4pretend 6me 1The ones 2near 3me], and the ones knowing my  name forgot me.

15. As for the neighbors of the house, [3female attendants 1and also 2my], I was foreign before them.

16. [2attendant 1I called my], and he obeyed not; [3mouth 1and 2my] beseeched him.

17. And I entreated  my wife; and I called -- flattering the sons of my concubines.

18. But they [2into 3the 4eon 1undid me]; whenever I rise up, [2against 3me 1they speak].

19. [4abhorred 5me 1The ones 2knowing 3me]; whom indeed I had loved, rose up against me.

20. [3in 4my skin 2festers  1My flesh];  and the things of my bones [2in 3teeth 1are held].

21. Show mercy on me, show mercy on me, O friends! [3the hand 1for 4of the lord  5touching 6me 2it is].

22. And why do you pursue me as also the lord, [4with 1and 5my flesh 2you are not 3filled up]?

23. For what that [2might be given 3to be written  1my words], and to put them in a scroll for the eon;

24. written with a stylus of iron and on lead, or [2on 3a rock 1being engraved].

25. For I know that [6everlasting 5is 1the one 3to enfeeble 4me 2being about] upon the earth,

26. to raise up  my skin  being fatigued by these things. For by the lord these things was exhausted on me,

27. which I myself am conscious of, which my eye has seen, and not another; but all [2on me 1has been exhausted] in my bosom.

28. But if even you shall say, What shall we say before him, and [2the root 3of the matter 1so find] in him?

29. Venerate even to yourselves from a covering! For rage [2upon 3the lawless ones 1shall come], and then they shall know where [3is 1their  2material].  

## Job 20

1.  Sophar Addresses the Lawbreakers And undertaking, Sophar the Minean says,

2. Not so far have I undertook to contradict you in these things, and neither do you perceive more than I.

3. [2instruction 3for making me ashamed 1I will hearken to]; and the spirit of  understanding answers me.

4. Have [2these things 1you known] from the yet of which time [2was put 1man] upon the earth?

5. For the gladness of the impious [2downfall 1is an extraordinary]; and a cause for joy of the lawbreakers is destruction.

6. If [3should ascend 4into 5heaven 1his  2gifts],  and his sacrifice [2the clouds 1should touch];

7. for whenever he should seem already firmly fixed, then [2unto 3the end 1he shall perish]; and the ones knowing him shall say, Where is he?

8. As if a dream spreading forth, in no way shall he be found; so he flys as if [2manifestation 1a nightly].

9. The eye overlooked, and does not proceed, and [2no longer 3pays attention to 4him  1his place].

10.  [4his sons 1May 3destroy 2his inferiors],  and may his hands light the fire of griefs.

11. His bones were filled with the vigor of his youth, and [2with 3him 4upon 5the embankment 1it shall go to bed].

12. Though [2should be sweet 3in 4his mouth 1evil], he shall hide it under  his tongue,

13. and he shall not spare it, and will not abandon it, but brings it in the midst  of his throat.

14. Yet in no way shall he be able to help himself; the bile of an asp is in his belly.

15. His riches unjustly brought together shall be vomited forth. From out of his house [2shall drag him away 1an angel].

16. [3the rage 1And 4of dragons 2may he nurse]; [2may 5do away with 1and 6him 3the tongue 4of a serpent].

17. May he not behold the milking of grazing animals, nor the pastures of honey and butter.

18. For [3in emptiness 4and 5vanity 1he tired 2for riches], of which he shall not taste; it is as if tough, unchewable, and impotable.

19. [4of many 1For 5of the disabled 3the houses 2he crushed]; and a habitation he seized by force, and he established it not.

20. [3is not 1His 2safety] in the possessions; by his desire he will not escape.

21. There is no leftover  of his foods; on account of this [3shall not 4bloom 1his  2good things].

22. And whenever it should seem urgent to accomplish something, he shall be afflicted; and all distress [2upon 3him 1shall come].

23. If by any means he might fill his belly, let God send as a successor upon him the rage of anger; may [2wash 3over 4him 1griefs].

24. And in no way shall he be delivered from the hand of iron; may [3pierce 4him 1the bow 2of brass];

25. [2may 4go completely 1and 5through 6his body 3the arrow]; [3the stars 1and 5on 6his habitation 2may 4walk]; [2upon 3him 1may fears be].

26. [3all 1And 4darkness 6for him 2may 5wait]; [3shall devour 4him 2fire 1inextinguishable]; [2may 4inflict evil on 1and 5his 3a stranger]  house.

27. [2may 5uncover 1And 6his 3the 4heaven]  lawless deeds; and the earth rise up against him.

28. May [2draw  3his house 1destruction] unto the end; [2the day 3of anger 1may] come upon him.

29. This is the portion [2man 1of an impious] from the lord, and the possession of his substance given to him by the overseer.  

## Job 21

1.  Job Recounts How the Wicked Prosper And undertaking, Job says,

2. Hear, hear my  words! that there should be to me [3from 4you 1this  2comfort].

3. Lift me! and I will speak, then you shall not ridicule me.

4. For what, is [3from man 1my  2rebuke]? or why shall I not be enraged?

5. O ones looking at me, wonder [2your hand 1while putting] upon your jaw.

6. For even if I should remember, I hurry, [3hold 1and 4the things of my 5flesh 2griefs].

7. Why do the impious live, and they grow old, and in riches?

8.  Their sowing is according to their soul's desire;  and their children in eyes.

9.  Their houses prosper, and fear is not to them at all; and the whip of the lord is not upon them.

10.  Their ox does not bring forth prematurely, [5are preserved 1and 2their 4ones 3pregnant] to have, and not to trip.

11. And they remain as [2sheep 1everlasting],  and their children play before them,

12. taking up the psaltery and harp, and they are gladdened at the sound of a psalm.

13. And they complete [2with 3good things  1their existence], and in the rest of Hades they go to sleep.

14. And he says to the lord, Separate from me! [4your ways 3to know 1I do not 2want].

15. What is fit that we shall serve him? and what benefit, that we shall meet with him?

16. [2in 3hands 1For 6were not 7to him 4the 5good things]; but works of the impious he does not inspect.

17. But in fact, even [2of the impious 1the lamp] shall be extinguished, and there shall come upon them the final event, and pangs from them they shall have from anger.

18. And they will be as straw before the wind, or as a cloud of dust which [2took up 1the tempest].

19. May [2fail 3his sons 1his possessions]; and God shall recompense to him, and he shall know it.

20. May [2behold  1his eyes]  his own slaughter; and by the lord may he not be delivered.

21. For  his will is in his house with him, and the numbers of his months were divided.

22. Is it not the lord who is the one teaching understanding and higher knowledge? And is it not he who [2the wise 1litigates].

23. This one shall die in the might of his singleness of purpose, but entirely enjoying pleasure and prospering;

24.  and his insides are full of fat, [3marrow 1and 2his] is diffused in him.

25.  And another one comes to an end in bitterness of soul, not eating anything good.

26. But in one accord upon the earth they sleep, and rottenness covers them.

27. So as I know you, that you daringly press upon me;

28. that you shall say, Where is the house of the ruler? and where is the protection of the tents of the impious?

29. Ask the ones passing by the way, and  [2their signs 1you shall not separate from].

30. For unto the day of destruction [3lightens 1the 2wicked one]; for the day of his anger he shall be taken away.

31. Who will report unto his face  his way? And what he did, who shall recompense to him?

32. And he [2unto 3the tombs 1was carried away]; and [2upon 3the heaps 1stayed awake].

33. [3was sweet 4to him 1The gravel 2of the rushing stream], and after him every man shall go forth, and in front of him there are innumerable ones.

34. And how do you comfort me in vain?  but for me to rest from you is nothing.  

## Job 22

1.  Eliphaz Accuses Job of Injustice And undertaking, Eliphaz the Temanite says,

2. Is it not the lord that is the one teaching understanding and higher knowledge?

3. For what does it concern the lord if you were  [2in works 1blameless], or what benefit that you simplify  your way?

4. or [2your word 1making] will he reprove you? and will he enter together with you for judgment?

5. Is it not that your evil is much, [5innumerable 1and 2your 4are  3sins]?

6. And you took security  of your brethren without cause, [3clothing 1and 4of the naked 2you removed].

7. Nor [2water 4for the thirsting 1did you give 3to drink], and [3of ones hungering 1you deprived 2a morsel].

8. And you admired the faces of some; you resettled the poor upon the earth;

9. [3widows 1and 2you sent out] empty, [3on orphans 1and 2you inflicted evil].

10. Accordingly [2encircled 3you 1snares], and [3hurried 4you 2war 1an extraordinary].

11. The light [3for you 2darkness 1resulted in]; and in going to sleep water covered you.

12. Is it not that the one [2the 3high places 1inhabiting] inspects? [3the ones 1and 5insolence 4bearing 2he humbled]?

13. And you said, What does [3know 1the 2mighty one]? or [2in 3the 4dark 1does he judge]?

14. A cloud is his concealment, and he shall not be seen; and the curve of heaven he travels over.

15. [2not 5road 4the eternal 1Will you 3guard] which [3trod 2men 1unjust]?

16. The ones who were seized untimely are as a river overflowing  their foundations.

17. The ones saying, The lord, what will he do to us? or what will [3bring upon 4us 1the 2almighty]?

18. And he is the one who filled up  their houses with good things; but the counsel of the impious is at a distance from him.

19. In beholding, the just laugh; and the blameless one sneers at them.

20. Except [2vanished  1their support], and  [3their vestige 2shall devour 1fire].

21. Become firm indeed! if you should remain, so that  your fruit will be for good things.

22. And take [2from out of 3his mouth 1an utterance]! and take up  his sayings in your heart!

23. And if you should turn and humble yourself before the lord, [3to be a distance 1then you made 4from 5your habitation 2wrongdoing].

24. You shall put upon an embankment in rock, even as a rock of a rushing stream of Ophir.

25. [4will be 1Then 5your 2the 3almighty] helper from the enemies, [4clean 1and 2he will render 3you] as [2silver 1purified].

26. So then, you shall speak openly before the lord, looking up into the heaven happily.

27. [3vowing 1And 2of your] to him, he will listen to you; and he will give to you power to render the vows.

28. And he will restore to you a habitation of righteousness, and upon your ways will be brightness.

29. For one humbled himself; and you shall say, He is prideful, but the one having downcast  eyes, he shall deliver.

30. He shall rescue the innocent; but be delivered in [2cleanness 3of hands 1your]!  

## Job 23

1.  Job's Justification And undertaking Job says,

2. For indeed I know that [3out of 4my hand  1my rebuke 2is]; and  his hand [2heavy 1has become] over my moaning.

3. But who is it that may know that I might find him, and that I might come to the end of the matter?

4. And I might speak [2for myself 1judgment],  and with my mouth I shall fill up reproofs.

5. And then I may know the cure which he shall speak to me, and then I may perceive what he shall report to me.

6. And if in much strength he shall come upon me, so then [4with 5intimidation 3me 1he shall not 2treat].

7. For truth and reproof are from him; and may he bring [2unto 3my end  1equity].

8. For at first I shall go, and no longer am I; and the things of the latter end, what do I know?

9. [2with the left h  and 1In his acting], I cannot hold back; he covers the right hand, and I shall not see it.

10. For he knows [2already 1my way]; he examined me as the gold.

11. And I shall go forth in his precepts, [3ways 1for 2his] I kept; and in no way shall I turn aside from his precepts;

12. and in no way shall I pass by them; and in my bosom I hid  his sayings.

13. But if even he judged thus, who is the one contradicting him;  for he wanted and did.

14. On account of this, [2unto 3him 1I have hastened]; and being admonished, I thought of him.

15. Over this  [2his face 1I should take] seriously; I shall contemplate and shall be terrified of him.

16. But the lord softened  my heart, and the almighty hastened me.

17. [3not 1For 2I knew] that [2shall come upon 3me 1darkness]; [4before 6face 1and 5my 3covered 2dimness].  

## Job 24

1.  Job Questions the Actions of the Impious And why did [4by the lord 2not 3escape notice 1the seasons]?

2. And the impious [2the border 1passed over], [2a flock 3with 4shepherd 1seizing].

3. [2a beast of burden 1And] of orphans they took away, and oxen of widows for security.

4. They turned aside the disabled from [2way 1the just]; with one accord [3was hidden 1the gentle 2of the earth].

5. And they resulted as if donkeys in the field [2for 3me 1going forth] on their own action; [5is delicious 1their 2bread 3for 4the young].

6. [2a field 5before 6its season 3not 4being their own 1They harvested]; and the disabled [2the vineyards 3of the impious 4without pay 5and 6without eating 1worked].

7. [3naked 2many 1They rested] without clothes; [3clothing 1and 4necessary for their life 2they removed].

8. From the mists of the mountains they are wetted; from  [2not holding 3to them 1protection] [2with rock 1they covered themselves].

9. They seized the orphan from the breast, [3the one falling off 1and 2they humbled].

10. And of naked ones they rested wrongfully, and of ones hungering [2the 3morsel 1they removed].

11. In narrows they wrongly lie in wait; and the way of the just they knew not.

12. The ones from the city and [2houses 1the ones of their own] they cast out; and the soul of the infants moaned greatly.

13. [3did he 1But 2why 5these 4in overseeing] not act [2upon 3the earth 1in their being]? and they did not recognize, and the way of righteousness they knew not, nor [2by their short-cuts 1were gone].

14. But knowing their  works he delivered them unto darkness; and night will be as a thief.

15. And the eye of the adulterer watched for the darkness, saying, [2will not 3think of me beforehand 1The eye]; and [2a concealment 3for his face 1he put].

16. [3he dug through 1In 2darkness] houses; by day they seal up themselves. they do not know the light.

17. For with one accord to them in the morning is the shadow of death; for each shall realize the disturbances of the shadow of death.

18. He is light upon the face of the water; may [2be cursed  1their portion] upon the earth; [2may 4appear 1and  3their plants

19. 6upon 7the earth 5dry]; for armfuls of orphans they seized by force.

20. So then [3is called to mind 1his  2sin], and as fog of dew [2vanishes 1he]; and may it be recompensed to him what he acted; [2may 5be destroyed 1and 3every 4unjust one] equally [2wood 1as incurable rotten].

21. For the sterile woman [2not 4well 1he did 3do], and on the helpless woman he did not show mercy.

22. And in rage he overturned the disabled; [2in rising up 1accordingly], in no way shall he trust in  his own life.

23. In being infirm, let him not hope to be healed! but he shall fall in disease.

24. [4many 1For 3afflicted  2his arrogance]; but he withered as a mallow plant in sweltering heat, and as an ear of corn [2from 3the stubble 4by itself 1falling off].

25. But if not, who is the one saying [3falsely 1for me 2to speak], and he renders [2as 3nothing  1my words]?  

## Job 25

1.  Baldad Recounts Man's Rottenness And undertaking, Baldad the Shuhite says,

2. For what retort or fear is his -- the one making  all things in the highest?

3. For let not any undertake the thought that there is deferment for marauders. [2upon 3whom 1And] will there not come an ambush from him?

4. For how shall [2be 3just 1a mortal] before the lord? or who may cleanse himself born of a woman?

5. If [2the moon 1he should order], then it does not shine; and the stars are not pure before him.

6. But alas, man is rottenness, and the son of man a worm.  

## Job 26

1.  By Order All Things Are Made And undertaking, Job says,

2. To whom do you lie near to, or to whom are you about to help? Is it not the one who has much strength, and whose arm is fortified?

3. By whom have you been advised, is it not to the one who has all wisdom? or to whom will you follow after, is it not the one who has greatest power?

4. To whom did you announce words? [3breath 1and 2whose] is it that comes forth from you?

5. Shall giants act as midwife from beneath the water, and  for his neighbors?

6. [2is naked  1Hades] before him, and there is no wrap-around garment  for destruction.

7. He stretches out the north wind upon nothing, and hangs the earth upon nothing;

8. binding water in his clouds, and [2is not 3torn 1the cloud] underneath it;

9.  holding back the front of his throne, spreading [2over 3it 1his cloud].

10. By order he made the curvature upon the face of the water till the completion of light with darkness.

11. The columns of heaven are spread out, and are startled at  his reproach.

12. By strength he rested the sea, and by higher knowledge he spread forth for the whale.

13. And the bolts of heaven are in awe of him; [3order 1and 2by his] he put to death the dragon defector.

14. Behold, these are the parts of his way; and at the exhalation of his word we hearken to him; [6the strength 1and 7of his thunder 2who 3knows 4when 5he will execute]?  

## Job 27

1.  Job Claims Innocence And still Job proceeded and said in the retort.

2. [2lives  1God] who thus has judged me, even the almighty, the one embittering my  soul;

3. is it not yet  of my breath to be in me, [3breath 1and 2the divine]  remains to me in my nostrils?

4. [2shall not 3speak  1My lips] lawless things, nor  [2my soul 1shall] meditate upon wrongdoing.

5. May it not be to me [3as just ones 2you 1to sentence]. Until whenever I die [3not 1for 2I will] dismiss from me  my innocence,

6. [3to my righteousness 1and 2taking heed] in no way will I let it go; [3not 1for 2I am 5fully conscious 4myself] [2out of place 1of acting].

7. No rather, but may [2be  1my enemies] as the undoing of the impious, and the ones [2against 3me 1rising up] as the destruction of the lawbreakers.

8.  For what is the hope of the impious that he waits for? [2in yielding 3upon 4the lord 1Is it] that he shall be delivered?

9. or  [4his supplication 1will 3listen to  2God]? or when [2comes upon 3him 1necessity],

10. shall he hold any confidence before him? or as one calling upon him, shall he listen to him?

11. But indeed, I will announce to you what is in the hand of the lord; the things which are by the almighty I shall not lie about.

12. Behold, you all know that [2vanity 3upon vanity 1you put].

13. This is the portion [2man 1of an impious] from the lord, and the possession of mighty ones shall come from the almighty upon them.

14. And if [3many 2become  1his sons], [2for 3slaughter 1they will be]; and if even they should arrive at manhood they shall beg.

15. And the ones remaining of his [2in plague 1shall come to an end]; [5widows 1and 4on their 2no one 3shall show mercy].

16. If he should have gathered together [2as 3earth 1silver], and equally [3as mortar 1shall prepare 2gold],

17. all these things the just shall procure,  and of his things the true ones will control.

18. [3turned out to be 1And  2his house] as if for a moth, and as if for a spider.

19. The rich man shall sleep, and shall not proceed; his eyes are opened wide, and he is no longer.

20. [2meet up with 3him 4as if 5water  1Griefs]; and by night [2takes 3him 1the dark].

21. [2takes 3him 1A burning wind], and he shall go forth; and it shall winnow him from out of  his place.

22. And he shall cast upon him, and shall not spare; [3from out of 4his hand 2exile 1he shall flee into].

23. He shall cause man to clap [2against 3him 1his hands], and he shall whistle at him from out of  his place.  

## Job 28

1.  Job Examines Wisdom and Knowledge For there is [2for silver 1a place] from where it exists, and a place for gold from where it is refined.

2. [2iron 1For 4from out of 5the earth 3comes], and brass equally [2like stone 1is quarried].

3. [2an order 1He established] for darkness, and every limit he determines exactly; [5is as a stone 1darkness 2and 3the shadow 4of death].

4. There is a breach of the rushing stream from powder; and the ones forgetting [2way 1the just] are weakened; of mortals -- they are shaken.

5. As for the earth, out of it shall come forth bread; underneath it, it was turned as fire.

6. [2are the place 3of the sapphire  1Her stones]; and [2an embankment 1her gold].

7. There is a road [4not 2knows 3it 1the bird]; and [3looked not over 4it 1the eye 2of the vulture],

8. [5not 3trod 4it 1the sons 2of ostentatious ones]; [3not 2went 4upon 5it 1a lion].

9. [3in 4a chiseled place 1He stretched forth 2his hand], and overturned [2by 3the roots 1mountains];

10. and the hill of rivers he tore up; [5every 1and 6valuable thing 4beheld 2my  3eye].

11. And the depths of the rivers he uncovered, and he shows his power in light.

12.  But [2is wisdom 1from what place] found? and of what place is  higher knowledge?

13. [2knows not 1A mortal] her way, in no way is she found among men.

14. The abyss said, She is not in me; and the sea said, She is not with me.

15. One shall not give an investment for her, and shall not set silver as a bargain for her.

16. And she shall not be compared with the gold of Ophir, with [2onyx 1valuable] and sapphire.

17. [4shall not 5be equal 6to her 1Gold 2and 3glass], nor  [3as barter 4for her 1items 2of gold].

18. Meteorites and crystal shall not be mentioned; but draw on wisdom above the innermost things.

19. [3shall not 4be equal 5to her 1The topaz 2of Ethiopia]; [4gold 3pure 1she shall not 2be compared with].

20. But concerning wisdom, from what place shall she be found? and of what kind of place is  understanding?

21. She has escaped notice of every man; and from the birds of the heaven she was hid.

22.  Destruction and  death said, We have heard of her  fame.

23. God [4well 1commended 2her  3way]; and he knows  her place.

24. For he  [2under 3heaven 1inspects all things], knowing the things in the earth;

25. all which he made, [2of the winds 1even the weight], [2of water 1and the measures].

26. When he made them, thus seeing he counted them, and made a way for the vibration of sound.

27. Then he beheld it, he described it; preparing he tracked it out.

28. And he said to man, Behold,  godliness is wisdom;  and being at a distance from evils is higher knowledge.  

## Job 29

1.  The Righteous State But still Job proceeding spoke the retort.

2. O that he might have put me according to the month before the days of which [3me  1God 2guarded];

3. as when [2shone  1his lamp] over my head; when  [4by his light 1I went 2through 3darkness];

4. when I was in the days of my youth; when  God overseeing dealt with  my house;

5. when I was [2flush 1exceedingly], and round about me  were my children;

6. when [2poured forth  1my ways] butter,  and my mountains poured forth milk;

7. when I went forth at daybreak into the city, [5in 1and 6the squares 2they placed 3my  4chair].

8. In beholding me, the young men hid, [3the old men 1and 2all] stood.

9. And the stout men ceased speaking, [2their finger 1placing] to their mouth.

10. And the ones hearing declared me blessed; and their tongue [2to 3their throat 1cleaved].

11. For the ear heard, and blessed me; and the eye beholding me, turned aside.

12. For I delivered the poor from out of the hand of the mighty one; and the orphan in whom there was no helper, I helped.

13. [2the blessing 3of the one perishing 5upon 6me 1May 4come]; for the mouth of the widow blessed me.

14. And righteousness I had put on, and I clothed on judgment equal to a double garment.

15. I was the eye of the blind, and the foot for the lame.

16. I was the father of the disabled; [3the cause 1and 4which 5I knew not 2I tracked out].

17. And I broke the molars of unjust ones; and from out of the midst  of their teeth [2the prey 1I pulled out].

18. And I said,  My stature shall grow old as the trunk of a palm; [2with much 3time 1I shall spend life].

19. The root was widened upon the water, and the dew lodged among  my harvest.

20.  My glory was new with me, and  my bow [2in 3his hand 1went forth].

21. Men hearing of me took heed, and kept silent over  my counsel.

22. At  my word they proceeded not; [3overjoyed 1but 2they became] when I spoke to them.

23. As the earth thirsting, favorably receiving the rain, so were these  at my speech.

24. If I should have laughed on them, in no way should they have trusted the thing; and the light  of my face was not fallen away.

25. I chose their way, and I sat as ruler; and I encamped as king among armed ones, in which manner [2mourners 1comforting].  

## Job 30

1.  Job Is Treated with Contempt And now [2ridicule 3me 1the least of them]; now they admonish me in turn -- whom I treated [2with contempt  1their fathers], whom I did not esteem to be worthy of dogs  of my grazing flocks.

2. And indeed, [2is the strength 3of their hands 1what profit] to me? [2of 3them 1It was destroyed] to completion.

3. In lack and hunger one is barren, as the ones fleeing waterless yesterday in conflict and misery.

4. The ones breaking off the marine plant upon the sounding shore, whose marine plants were for their  grain; and were without honor, and being treated as worthless, lacking of every good thing; and the roots of trees gnawed because of [2hunger 1great].

5. [2rose up against 3me 1Thieves],

6. whom  their houses were burrows of rocks.

7. [7in the midst 9of distinct places 6shall yell 1the ones who 3under 5stick dwellings 4wild 2pass life].

8. [2of fools 1They are sons] and [2without honor 1have a name], and fame extinguished from the earth.

9. And now [4harp 1I 2am 3their], and [2me 3for a common topic 1they have].

10. And they abhorred me, separating far from me; and from my face they spared not spittle.

11. For having opened his quiver he afflicted me; and [2the bridle  3of my presence 1sent away].

12. [2on 3the right hand 4of their offspring 1They rose up against me]. [2his feet 1He stretched out] and opened against me; with paths of their destruction

13. they obliterated my paths; for he took off my  apparel; with his spear he ran me through;

14. and he has judged me as he wills; in griefs I am befouled.

15. [3return 1My  2griefs]; [3was set out 1my  2hope] as if the wind, and [3as if 4a cloud  2deliverance 1my].

16. And now [3upon 4me 2shall be poured out  1my soul]; [4suffice 1and 5me 2days 3of griefs].

17. And at night  my bones burn,  and my nerves are parted.

18. With great strength it took hold of my  robe; as the cleft  of my garment it compassed me.

19. And you have esteemed me equal to clay; in earth and ashes is my  portion.

20. And I have cried out to you, and [3not 1you hear 2me]; they stood and contemplated me.

21. And you mounted against me mercilessly; [3hand 2with a strong 1you whipped me].

22. And you arranged against me with griefs; and you threw me away from deliverance.

23. For I know that death will obliterate me; for the house of every mortal is ground.

24. For ought that I should be able [2myself 1to lay hands upon], or indeed beseech another and he should do this to me.

25. And I [2over 3every 4disabled man 1wept]; and I moaned beholding man in necessities.

26. I waited for good things, and behold [3met 4with me 5instead 2days 1bad].

27.  My belly erupted, and would not keep silent; [3anticipated 4me 1days 2of poorness].

28. [2moaning 1I went] without a rein; and I have stood in the assembly crying out.

29. [2a brother 1I have become] of sirens, and companion of ostriches.

30.  My skin is darkened greatly,  and my bones from sweltering heat.

31. [4turned 1And 5into 6mourning 2my  3harp],  and my psalm into weeping for me.  

## Job 31

1.  Job's Covenant [2a covenant 1I made]  with my eyes, and I will not take notice upon a virgin.

2. And what portion is from  God above, and [2inheritance 1what fit] is from the highest?

3. Woe, destruction to the unjust, and alienation to the one committing lawlessness.

4. Will he not see my way, and [2all  3my footsteps 1count out]?

5. But if I was going with jokesters, or even hurrying  my foot for treachery;

6. (for I stand in [2yoke balance scale 1a just], [4knew 1and 2the 3 lord]  my innocence);

7. if [2turned aside  1my foot] from out of the way, or if even  [3my eye 2follows after  1my heart], and if even  my hands touched bribes;

8. [2may I sow 1then], and others eat; [3rootless 1and 2may I become] upon the earth.

9. If [2followed after  1my heart] the wife [2man 1of another], and if [2laid in wait 1I had] at her doors;

10. [2may 5please 1then 4even  3my wife] another;  and [2my infants 1may 3be humbled].

11. For the rage of anger is unrestrained in the defiling of a man's wife.

12. [3a fire 1For 2it is] burning upon all the parts; and whomever it may come upon [2from 3the roots 1it destroyed].

13. And if even I treated as worthless the equity due my male attendant or female attendant, in their pleading with me,

14. what then shall I do if [4chastisement 5for me 3shall appoint 1the 2 lord]? and if also he should visit, what answer shall I make?

15. Were they not even as I, born in a womb? and these were born, and we were born in the same belly.

16. But the disabled [2whatever need 4at some time or other 3they had 1missed not]; [5of the widow 1and 3the 4eye 2I wasted not].

17. And even if  [2my morsel 1I ate] alone, and [4not 5with an orphan 1I shared 2of 3it],

18. (for from my youth I nourished them as a father, and from the womb of my mother I guided);

19. and even if I overlooked the naked perishing, and clothed him not;

20. and the disabled, unless they blessed me, and of the shearing wool of my lambs [2were not heated  1their shoulders];

21. and if I lifted up [2against an orphan 1a hand], (relying that much [3to me 1help 2remained]);

22. [2may 4separate 1then  3my shoulder] from the collar-bone,  and [2my arm 4from 5the 6elbow 1may 3be broken].

23. For the fear of the lord constrained me; from  his concern I shall not endure.

24. If I ordered up gold for my strength; and if even [3stone 2very costly 1I relied upon];

25. and even if [2gladness 1great] in riches was coming to me; and if also [3upon 4innumerable things 1I put 2my hand];

26. (or do we not see [3sun 1the 2shining] subsiding, and the moon waning? [3no power 1For 4to 5them 2there is]).

27. And if [2was deceived 3in private  1my heart]; and if [3hand 2placing my 4upon 5my mouth 1I was fond of];

28. then let this be [2so to me 5lawlessness 3as the 4greatest 1imputed]; for I lied before the lord of the highest.

29. And even if [2gratified 1I became] at the calamitous downfall of my enemies; and said in my heart, Well done!

30. Let [3hear 1then  2my ear]  my curse, and may I then be a common topic  by my people for my inflicting evil.

31. And if even often [2said  1my female attendants], Who ever might give to us  his flesh to satisfy? exceedingly of my being gracious.

32. [4outside 1for 3lodged not 2the stranger],  and my door [2to all 3that came 1was open].

33. And if even of sins, unintentionally I hid  my sin,

34. (for I was not diverted [2multitude 1by a great]  to not openly declare before them); and if even I allowed a disabled man to go forth from my door [2bosom 1with an empty],

35. (oh that there might be given one to hear me), [4of the hand 1but 5of the lord 2unless 3I was in awe]; and as to a writ which I had against anyone,

36. [3upon 4even my shoulders 1putting it on 2a crown] I read it.

37. And unless tearing it I gave it back [2nothing 1having received] from a debtor.

38. If [5against 6me 1perhaps 2the 3earth 4moaned], and even if  her furrows wept with one accord;

39. and even if  of its strength I ate alone without value; and if even [2of the life 3of the master 4of the 5land 1in taking anything] I fretted him;

40. instead of wheat then may there come forth to me nettles; and instead of barley a bush. And Job ceased words.  

## Job 32

1.  Elihu Speaks in Anger And they were quiet, and  [2three 3friends 1his] no longer contradicted Job, [3was 1for 2Job] righteous before them.

2. [3was provoked to anger 1And 2Elihu], the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the kin of Ram, of the place of Ausis; and he was provoked to anger against Job exceedingly, because he sentenced himself as righteous before the lord.

3. [2even 3against 4the 5three 1But] friends he was provoked to anger exceedingly, for they were not able to answer contrary to Job; and they established him to be an impious man.

4. And Elihu waited to give an answer to Job, for [2older 3than he 1they were] in days.

5. And Elihu saw that there is no answer in the mouths of the three men, and [2was enraged 1his anger].

6. And undertaking, Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, said, [3younger 1Forasmuch as 2I am] in time, and you are older; therefore I was still, fearing  to announce to you the [2of myself 1higher knowledge].

7. And I said, [2not  3time 1It is]  for speaking; [2in 3many 1but] years men have not known wisdom.

8. But there is a spirit in mortals, and the breath of the almighty is the one teaching.

9. [4not 1The 2long-lived 3are] wise as such; and neither do the aged know equity.

10. Therefore I said, Hear me! and I will announce to you what I know.

11. Give ear to my  sayings! for I will speak in your hearing, as far as of which time you should examine the words;

12. and until you shall perceive; and behold, there was no one  reproving Job, in answering his words from you,

13. that you should not say, We found wisdom being added by the lord.

14. [3man 1And 2you commissioned] to speak such words.

15. And they were terrified. They answered not any longer; [2were old 3coming from 4them 1words].

16. I waited, for I did not speak, for they stood, they answered not.

17. And undertaking, Elihu says, Again I shall speak,

18. [3full 1for 2I am] of words, [6destroys 1for 7me 2the 3wind 4of the 5belly];

19.  and my belly is as if a leather bag of sweet new wine bubbling, being tied up; and as if the bellows of a brazier tearing forth.

20. I will speak that I shall rest myself in opening  my lips.

21. [4by man 1For 2in no way 3shall I be shamed], and in fact, nor [2from a mortal 1shall I in any way feel shame].

22. [3not 1For 2I know] to admire a person; but if not, even [3me 1moths 2shall devour].  

## Job 33

1.  Elihu Proposes The LORD Recompenses Justice But in fact, hear, O Job,  my words, and [3speech 1give ear 2to my]!

2. For behold, I opened  my mouth, and [2spoke  1my tongue].

3. [3is pure 1My  2heart] in words, and the understanding of my lips [2pure 1shall purpose].

4. [3spirit 2divine 1The] made me, and the breath of the almighty is what is teaching me.

5. If you should be able, give to me an answer for these things! Wait, stand against me, and I against you!

6. From out of clay you were molded as also I; [2from out of 3the 4same clay 1we were molded].

7. [3not  5in the fear 6of me 1You 2shall 4whirl about], nor  [2my hand 4heavy 1shall 3be] upon you.

8. Except you said in my ears, [2the voice 3of your words 1I have heard], for you say,

9. I am pure, not having sinned; [3blameless 1for 2I am], for I did not act lawlessly.

10. [3a complaint 1But 4against 5me 2he found], and he has esteemed me as if an opponent.

11. And he put [2in 3stocks of wood  1my foot], and guarded all my  ways.

12. For how say you, I am righteous, and he has not heeded me? [6eternal 1For 5is 2the one 3above 4mortals].

13. But you say, Why  of my righteousness has he not heeded every word?

14. For when  [4once 3speaks 1the 2 lord], or a second time,

15. sending a dream or in [2meditation 1a nightly], or as whenever [3falls 1an awful 2fear] upon men, in slumberings upon a bed;

16. then he uncovers the mind of men in sights of fear; with such he frightens them,

17. to turn a man from iniquity,  and [2his body 3from 4a calamitous downfall 1he rescues].

18. And he spares  his soul from death, and spares [2so as to not 3fall 1him] in war.

19. And again he reproves him by infirmity upon his bed, and [2a multitude 3of his bones 1he paralyzed].

20. [5any 1And 6eatable 7grain 2in no way 3shall he be able 4to favorably receive], even though  his soul [2food 1desires];

21. until whenever [3should fester 1his  2flesh], and [2should be exposed  1his bones] bare;

22. [3approached 1and 4unto 5death  2his soul],  and his life unto Hades.

23. If there might be a thousand messengers causing death, one of them in no way shall pierce him, if he should purpose in his heart to turn towards the lord, and announce to man  his own complaint,  and [2his lawlessness 1should show];

24. he shall hold him  to not fall into death; and he shall renew his  body as new plaster upon a wall;  and [2his bones 1he will fill up] with marrow.

25. He will make tender his  flesh as an infant, and he shall restore him to manhood among men.

26. And one vowing to the lord, and [2accepted 3for him 1it will be]; and he shall enter [2face 1with a clean], with an utterance of praise; and he will recompense [2to men 1righteousness].

27. Even then shall [2blame 1a man] himself, saying, What things have I completed? and [3not 4worth 1he chastised 2me] what I sinned.

28. Deliver my soul!  to not come unto corruption, that  my life [2light 1shall see].

29. Behold, all these things [3works 1the 2strong one 5ways 4three] with a man.

30. And he rescued  my soul from death, that  my life in light should praise him.

31. Give ear, O Job, and hear me! Be silent! for I myself shall speak.

32. If there are words in you, answer me! Speak! for I want justice to be done for you.

33. If not, you hear me! Be silent! and I will teach you wisdom!  

## Job 34

1.  Elihu Proposes that The LORD Inspects Men And undertaking, Elihu says,

2. Hear me! O wise men. O ones having knowledge, give ear to the good!

3. For the ear [2words 1tries], and the throat tastes food.

4. Judgment we should take up for ourselves; we should know between ourselves what is good.

5. For Job has said, I am righteous; the lord has dismissed my  judgment.

6. And he lied in my judgment; [2is violent  1my spear] without injustice.

7. What man is as Job, drinking sneering as if water?

8. Not sinning, nor being impious, nor wholly participating with ones committing  lawless deeds,  to go with the impious.

9. [3not 1For 2you should] say that there will not be an overseeing of a man -- and there is an overseeing of him by the lord.

10. Therefore, O discerning of heart, hear me! [2not 4to me 1May it 3be] before the lord to be impious, and before the almighty to disturb  justice.

11. But he gives back to man as [3does 1each 2of them], and by a path man will find him.

12. And do you imagine the lord [2something out of place 1doing], or that the almighty will disturb a judgment -- the one who made the earth?

13. And who is the one acting  under heaven, and [2the things 3being in it 1all]?

14. For if he might want to constrain, and [2the 3spirit 4by 5himself 1to hold down],

15. [3would come to an end 1all 2flesh] with one accord. Every mortal [2into 3the earth 1shall go forth] from where even he was shaped.

16. But if he should not admonish, then hear these things! Give ear to the sound of words!

17. Behold then the one detesting lawless deeds, and the one destroying the wicked, being eternally righteous.

18. Impious is the one saying to a king, You act unlawfully, and saying, O impious one, to the rulers,

19. who was not feeling of respect for the person of honor, nor knows [2honor 1to appoint] to the stout men, to admire their persons.

20. [3in vanity 1But 4to them 2it shall result],  to cry out and to beseech a man; for they dealt unlawfully, turning aside the disabled.

21. For he is an observer of the works of men, [5has escaped 1and 6him 2nothing 3of how 4they act];

22. nor is there a place  to hide for the ones doing  lawless deeds.

23. For [2not 4upon 5a man 1he will 3put] any longer.

24. For the lord inspects all; He is the one perceiving untraceable things, honorable things also, and extraordinary things which there is no number;

25. the one knowing their  works, and he shall turn night upon them, and they shall be humbled.

26. And he extinguishes the impious, for they are visible before him.

27. For they turned aside from the law of God; [4ordinances 3his 1they did not 2recognize],

28. so as to bring unto him the cry of the needy; for [2the cry 3of the poor 1he will listen to];

29. and he [2rest 1will furnish], and who will condemn? and he will hide his face, and who shall see him? even against a nation and against a man together;

30. giving reign to a man who is a hypocrite, because of the discontent of people,

31. that to the mighty one  saying, I have received blessings; I will not take anything for security.

32. [2apart from 3myself 1I will see]; you show to me, if [2iniquity 1I practiced]! then in no way shall I proceed.

33. Will [3on 4you 1he pay 2it], in that you should have thrust it away; for you shall choose, and not I, and what you know -- speak!

34. Therefore the discerning in heart shall say these things, [3man 1and 2a wise] hears my  word.

35. But Job [2not 3with 4understanding 1spoke];  and his words are not with higher knowledge.

36. But in fact, learn Job! No [2give 1longer] an answer as the fools,

37. that we should not add upon our sins; for lawlessness [2against 3us 1may be imputed 5many 4in speaking] words before the lord.  

## Job 35

1.  Elihu Urges Job to Plead with The LORD And undertaking, Elihu says,

2. What is this you esteem in equity? You, who are you, that you said, I am righteous before the lord?

3. For you shall say, How should I have committed sinning?

4. I shall give to you an answer, and to [2three 3friends 1your].

5. Look up into the heaven, and behold! Study the clouds, how high they are from you!

6. If you sinned, what will you do? And even if in many things you acted lawlessly, what are you able to do?

7. Since then you are righteous, what shall you give to him, or what [2from out of 3your hand 1shall he take]?

8. To a man  likened to you --  of your impiety; and to a son of man --  of your righteousness.

9. [2by 3a multitude 1The ones being extorted] shall cry out; they shall yell because of the arm of many.

10. And one said not, Where is the God  who made me, the one delegating [2watches 1the nightly];

11. the one separating me from the four-footed beasts of the earth, and from the birds of heaven.

12. There they shall cry out, and in no way shall one listen, even because of the insolence of wicked men.

13. For things out of place [3does not want 4to behold 1the 2 lord], for he is the almighty.

14. He is an observer of the ones completing  lawless deeds, and he will deliver me; and you plead before him! if you are able to praise him, as he is.

15. And now that he is not numbering his anger, and he knows not [2transgressions 1exceeding],

16. even Job acting in folly opens  his mouth; in ignorance [2words 1he weighs down].  

## Job 36

1.  Elihu Proposes to Teach And proceeding still, Elihu says,

2. Wait for me a little more! that I shall teach you. [3still 1For 5in 6me 2there is 4speech].

3. Having taken up  my higher knowledge from afar, and to works of mine,

4. [2righteous things 1I will speak] in truth, and [2not 5unjust 6words 3unjustly 1you shall 4perceive].

5. But know! that the lord in no way shall undo the guileless man; the mighty in strength of heart.

6. The impious in no way will he restore to life; and [2equity 3for the poor 1he shall impute].

7. He will not remove [2from 3the righteous 1his eyes], and they shall be with kings on a throne; he shall seat them into victory, and they shall be exalted.

8. And the ones being shackled in manacles shall be held together by rough cords of poverty.

9. And he shall announce to them  their works, and  their transgressions, for they are prevalent.

10. But [2the 3righteous 1he will listen to]; and he spoke that they shall turn from unrighteousness.

11. If they shall hear and serve, they shall complete  their days among good things, and  their years among beautiful things.

12. But the impious are not preserved -- by  [2not 3willing 1their] to behold the lord, and because being admonished they were unhearing.

13. And hypocrites in heart shall order rage; they shall not yell, for he bound them.

14. [2may 4die 1Therefore 5in 6youth  3their soul],  and their life being pierced by messengers,

15. because they afflicted the weak and disabled; [3judgment 1and 4for the gentle 2he will expound].

16. And from when he beguiled from out of the mouth of the enemy, an abyss for throwing down underneath it, that [2went down 1your table] full of fatness.

17. [3shall not fail 1but 4from 5the righteous 2judgment];

18. and rage [2upon 3the impious 1will be], because of the impiety of bribes which they received for iniquities.

19. [2not 7you 1Let 6turn 8aside 5willingly 3the 4mind] of the supplication [3in 4necessity 1of the ones being 2disabled]! And all the ones fortifying strength.

20. You shall not drag away by night,  [2should ascend 1so that others] instead of them.

21. But guard lest you act out of place! [2of 3these things 1for] you took up because of poorness.

22. Behold, the strong one shall conquer by his strength, for who is as he -- the mighty one.

23. And who is the one examining his  works? or who is the one having said, He acted unjustly.

24. Remember that [4great  2works 1his 3are], which [2command 1men]!

25. Every man beholds in himself how many [3being pierced 2are 1mortals].

26. Behold, the strong one is great, and we shall not know him; [2the number 3of his years 1and] are unlimited.

27. [4shall be counted 1And 5by him 2the drops 3of rain], and shall they be poured for rain in the cloud.

28. [2shall flow 1Things grown old], [3shadow 1and 2clouds] over untold mortals.

29. And should one have perceived the spreading out of the clouds, as equal of his tent?

30. Behold, he stretches out [2upon 3it 1light], and [2the root 3of the 4sea 1he covers].

31. For in them he shall judge peoples; he shall give nourishment to the one being strong.

32. With the hands he covers light, and he gave charge concerning it with the encountering clouds.

33. He will announce [2concerning 3him 1his friend] -- for possession and for injustice.  

## Job 37

1.  Elihu Relates the Sovereignty of The LORD And from this [2is disturbed  1my heart], and was dropped down from out of  its place.

2. Hear a report in anger of rage of the lord! And a meditation from out of his mouth shall come forth.

3. Underneath all the heaven  is his sovereignty, and  his light is upon the wings of the earth.

4. After him [2shall yell out 1a voice]; he shall thunder with the sound of his insult; and he shall not bargain them, that one shall hear his voice.

5. [3will thunder 1The 2strong one 5with 6his voice 4wonders]. [2a season 1He established] for animals, and they know [2of the fold 1the order]. Upon all these things [3is not 4receded 1your  2thought], nor is [3reconciled 1your  2heart] with your body. For he did great things which we knew not;

6. ordering the snow, saying, Be upon the earth; and the winter rain of his command.

7. In the hand of every man he seals up, that [3should know 1every 2man]  his own weakness.

8. [3entered 1And 2the wild beasts] under the protection, and are tranquil in their lair.

9. From out of inner chambers come griefs, and from extremities chilliness.

10. And from the breath of the strong one he appoints ice; and he steers the water where ever he wants.

11. And if a chosen [2plasters over 1cloud], [2disperses 3the cloud 1then his light],

12. and he [2the swirls 1shall turn aside] by his rule for performing their works -- all as much as he should give charge to them.

13. These things were ordered by him upon the earth. Whether for instruction, whether for  his land, whether for an object of his mercy, he shall find it.

14. Give ear to these things, O Job! Stand admonished by the power of the lord!

15. We know that  God established  his works, [2light 1making] out of darkness.

16. And he knows the distinction of clouds, and the extraordinary calamitous downfalls of the wicked.

17. And your  apparel is hot, but there is tranquility upon the earth from the south.

18. Will you solidify with him for things grown old; things which are strong as the vision of a vessel?

19. Why teach me, what shall we say to him? then let us cease [2much 1from saying].

20. Is there a book or scribe standing beside me, that [3a man 1standing 2I should quell]?

21. [6to all 1But 4is not 5visible 2the 3light]; it is radiant among the things grown old, as if  from him upon the clouds.

22. From the north are clouds shining like gold; in these [7is great 1the 2glory 3and 4honor 5from 6the almighty];

23. and we do not find another likened to his strength. The one  [2justly 1judging], do you not imagine that he listens?

24. Therefore [2shall fear 3him  1men]; [6shall fear 1and 7him 2even 3the 4wise 5in heart].  

## Job 38

1.  The LORD Questions Job And after the ceasing [3of Elihu 1of the 2speech], [3said 1the 2 lord]  to Job through a tempest and cloud, saying,

2. Who is this  hiding counsel, and constraining matters in heart, [4from me 1and 2imagines 3to hide]?

3. Tie up [2as 3a man  1your loin]! And I will ask you, and you answer me!

4. Where were you in  my laying the foundation for the earth? And report to me! if you should have knowledge of understanding.

5. Who established the measures of it, if you know? Or who is the one bringing a measuring cord upon it?

6. Upon what  are its hooks pitched on? And who is the one laying [2foundation 3stone 1an angular] upon it?

7. When [2came to pass 1the stars], [3praised 4me 6a great voice 5with 1all 2my angels].

8. And I shut up the sea with gates, when it was led irresistibly [2out of 4belly 3its mother's 1going forth].

9. And I established the cloud for its clothing, and fog for its being swaddled.

10. And I established limits for it, I put in place bolts and gates.

11. And I said to it, Unto this far you shall come, and shall not pass over; and within yourself [3shall break 1your  2waves].

12. Or by you have I ordered [2brightness 1the early morning]? And did the morning star behold  his own order;

13. to take hold of the wings of the earth, to shake off the impious from it.

14. Or did you, having taken earth's clay, shape a living creature, and [2the power of speech 3to it 1establish] upon the earth?

15. And have you removed [3from 4the impious 1the 2light], [3the arm 1and 4of the proud 2broke]?

16. Did you come unto the spring of the sea, [3in 1and 4the tracks 5of the deep 2walk]?

17. [4open 1And 5to you 6in fear 2do the gates 3of death]; and did gatekeepers of Hades, in beholding you, become alarmed?

18. And have you been admonished about the breadth  under heaven? Announce it indeed to me! how great it is.

19. And of what kind of land lodges the light? And darkness, what kind  of place?

20. If you could lead me into their limits, and even if you know their paths.

21. Have you known that it is so then because you were born, and the number of your years great?

22. But did you come unto the treasuries of snow? [3the treasuries 1and 4of hail 2have you seen]?

23. And is it reserved to you for the hour of the enemies, for the day of war and battle?

24. And from what place goes forth the frost, or [2is dispersed 1the south wind] into the place under heaven?

25. And who prepared [3rain 2of the fierce 1the flow], and a way in uproar;

26.  to rain upon the land of which there is no man, the wilderness of which there is no [2existing 1man] in it;

27.  so as to fill the untrodden and uninhabited land, and the causing to sprout forth the issue of tender shoots?

28. Who is the rain's father, and who is the one giving birth to droplets of dew?

29. [2from out of 4womb 1And 3whose] comes forth the ice; [4the frost 1and 5in 6the heaven 2who 3gave birth to],

30. which comes down as if water flowing? [4the face 1And 5of the abyss 2who 3alarmed]?

31. And do you perceive the bond of Pleiades; and [2the barrier 3of Orion 1did you open]?

32. Or will you open Mazuroth in its time? And Hesperus with its tail -- will you lead it?

33. And do you know the circuits of heaven, or the things [3under 4heaven 2with one accord 1taking place]?

34. And will you call a cloud by voice, and in trembling [3water of rain 2the fierce 1will] obey you?

35. And will you send thunderbolts? and will they go forth? and shall they say to you, What is it?

36. And who gave women [2for a woven work 1wisdom], or [2for embroidery 1skill]?

37. And who is the one counting clouds in wisdom, [3the heaven 1and 4unto 5the earth 2leaned],

38. and it is poured as earth's powder, and I have cleaved it as a stone cube?

39. And will you hunt [2for the lions 1a prey]? [3the souls 1and 4of dragons 2fill up]?

40. for they are in awe in their lairs, and they sit in the woods lying in wait.

41. And who prepared [2for the crow 1carrion]? [3young 1for 2its 6to 7the lord 5cry out 4in wandering  9grain 8seeking].  

## Job 39

1. Do you know the time of the birthing of the antelopes of the rock? And did you watch the birth pangs of hinds?

2. And did you count [3months 1their 2full] of birthing? [4birth pangs 1and 3their 2did you untie]?

3. And did you nourish their  offspring outside of fear? [4birth pangs 1and 3their 2will you send away]?

4. [2shall rip forth  1Their young]; they shall be multiplied in offspring; their young will go forth and in no way shall return to them.

5. And who is the one letting [2donkey 1the wild] free? [5bonds 1and 4his 2who 3untied]?

6. For I established  for his habitation a wilderness, and  [2for his tents 1the salt-flats].

7. He ridicules the great multitude of the city, [3the complaint 1and 4of the tribute-gatherer 2hears not].

8. He shall survey the mountains as his pasture, and [2after 3every 4green thing 1he seeks].

9. [2shall 4be willing 1And 6to you 3the unicorn 5to serve], or to sleep at your stable?

10. And will you tie [2with 3straps 1his yoke], or will he draw furrows in the plain?

11. And do you rely upon him, because [2is great 1his strength]? and will you slacken [2for him  1your works]?

12. And do you trust that he will give back to you the seed, and carry it into your  threshing-floor?

13. The wing delighting ostriches; but should [2conceive 1the stork 2and 3feathers]?

14. for she shall let [2go 3unto 4the earth  1her eggs], and [2upon 3the dust 1she shall incubate];

15. and she forgot that the foot will disperse them, and the wild beasts of the field will trample them.

16. She hardened against  her offspring, so as to not bereave herself; in vain she tired without fear.

17. For [2quelled 3her  1God] wisdom, and portioned not to her with  understanding.

18. In time [2in 3height 1she will raise up high]; she will ridicule the horse and  his rider.

19. Or did you invest the horse with power, or clothe his neck in fear?

20. And did you invest in him full armor, and the glory of his breast in daring?

21. [2rooting up 3in 4the plain 1He prances], and he goes forth into the plain in strength.

22. [2meeting up with 3spears 1He ridicules], and in no way turns from an iron weapon.

23. Against him prance the bow and sword;

24. and in anger he shall obliterate the ground. In no way shall he trust until whenever [2signifies 1the trumpet];

25. and with the trumpet signifying, he says, Well done! And at a distance he smells war with leaping and crying out.

26. And from  your higher knowledge [2set 1does the hawk] having the look of effrontery with wings fixed looking down  towards the south?

27. And at  your order [2rise up high 1does the eagle], and does the vulture [3upon 4its nest 1sit 2lodged],

28. upon the prominence of the rock and is concealed?

29. Being at that place he seeks  grain; [3at a distance  1his eyes 2watch],

30. [3young 1and 2his] befoul themselves in blood; and where ever ones dying might be, immediately they are found. 

## Job 40

1. And [3responded 1the lord  2God]  to Job, and said,

2. Shall [2a judgment 3with 4the fit one 1you judge]? One reproving God -- shall he answer to him?

3.  Job Responds to The LORD And undertaking, Job says to the lord,

4. Why still do I plead, being admonished and reproved by the lord? Hearing such things, and being nothing; and I, what answer shall I give to these things? [2a hand 1I shall put] upon my mouth.

5. Once I have spoken, but for  a second time I will not proceed.

6. And again undertaking, the lord spoke  to Job from out of the cloud, saying,

7. But no, tie up [2as 3a man  1your loin]! and I will ask you, then you answer me!

8. Or should you undo my  judgment? And do you imagine me otherwise executing things with you? or that you should appear just?

9. or [2your arm 1is] as the arm of the lord? or [2with a voice 3as 4his 1do you thunder]?

10. Then lift yourself up in stature and power, [3with glory 1and 4and 5honor 2clothe yourself]!

11. And send angels in anger, [3all 1and 4the arrogant 2humble]!

12. [3the proud man 1And 2extinguish]! [2cause 4to rot 1and 3the impious] immediately!

13. And hide them in the earth with one accord! and the things of their faces [2with dishonor 1fill]!

14. And indeed, I shall acknowledge surely that [2is able  1your right hand] to deliver. 

15.  The Beast But indeed, behold, the wild beast by you; [2grass 3equal to 4oxen 1it eats].

16. Behold indeed,  his strength is in his loin,  and his power is in the navel of his belly.

17. He sets his tail as a cypress;  and his nerves are closely joined.

18.  His sides are sides of brass;  and his spine [2iron 1is as cast].

19. This is the beginning of the thing shaped by the lord; being made to be mocked by  his angels.

20. And coming upon [2mountain 1a chiseled], he produces a cause for joy to the four-footed in the infernal region.

21. Under all kinds of trees he sleeps; by the papyrus, and reed and flowering rush.

22. [3shadow 1And 4in him 2trees] with scions and branches of the chaste tree.

23. If there becomes an inundation, in no way shall it be perceived; he relies that [3will rush up 1the 2Jordan] into  his mouth.

24. In  his eye will one take him? Being caught in a snare will you drill his nose?  

## Job 41

1.  The Dragon And shall you lead the dragon by a hook, and put a halter around his nose?

2. Or will you tie a hook in  his nose, [4for a clasp 1and 2will you make a hole  3in his lip]?

3. And will he speak to you [2supplications 1earnest] softly?

4. [2will he establish 1And 4with 5you 3a covenant]? And will you take him [2servant 1for an everlasting]?

5. And will you play with him as a bird? Or will you bind him as a sparrow for a child?

6. [3feed 1And do 4in 5him 2nations]? [4partition 1And do 5him 3of the Phoenicians 2the nations]?

7. And everything afloat coming together in no way shall bear the hide [2one 3tail 1of his]; nor in the boats of fishermen shall they bear his head.

8. But shall you place a hand on him, remembering the war  taking place in his body, and let it no longer take place?

9. Have you not seen him, nor [2over 3the ones 4speaking 1wondered]?

10. Are you not in awe that it has been prepared by me? For who is the one opposing me?

11. Or who shall oppose me and remain, since all  under heaven is mine?

12. I will not keep silent because of him; and the word of power shall show mercy  equal to him.

13. Who will uncover the front of his clothing? and into the fold of his chest plate who can enter?

14. [3the gates 4of his face 1Who 2will open]? Round about his teeth is fear;

15.  His insides are as shields of brass, [3sinews 1and 2his] are as emery stone.

16. One  of one cleaves together, and wind in no way goes through it;

17. as a man to his brother they shall be cleaved; they are held together, and in no way draw apart.

18. In his sneezing [2shines forth 1brightness],  and his eyes are as the appearance of the morning star.

19. From out of his mouth [3shall go forth 2lamps 1burning], and scattered grates of fire.

20. From out of his nostrils comes forth smoke of a furnace burning [2of fire 1with coals].

21.  His soul is as live coals; and a flame [2from out of 3his mouth 1goes forth].

22. And in his neck lodges power. [3before 4him 2runs 1Destruction].

23. And the flesh of his body cleaves tightly. If one pours down upon him, he will not be shaken.

24.  His heart is fixed as stone, and he stands as an anvil, not malleable.

25. [3turning 1And 2his] gives fear [2wild beasts 1to the four-footed 4upon 5the earth 3leaping].

26. If [2should meet up with 3him 1lances], nothing in any way shall terrify by spear and chest plate.

27. For he esteems iron as straw, and brass as [2wood 1rotten].

28. In no way shall [3pierce 4him 1the bow 2of brass]. He esteems a slinger indeed as grass;

29. [3as 4stubble 2are considered 1hammers]; and he ridicules the quaking of a fire-bearer.

30.  His strewn bed [2points 1is of sharp]; and all the gold of the sea under him is as [2mud 1untold].

31. [3breaks out 1The 2abyss] as a brazen cauldron; and he esteems the sea as an ointment jar.

32. And the infernal region of the abyss is as if a captive; he considers the abyss for a promenade.

33. There is not anything upon the earth likened to him, being made, to be mocked at by  my angels.

34. Every lofty thing he sees; and he is king of all the things in the waters.  

## Job 42

1.  Job's defense And undertaking, Job [2to the 3 lord 1says],

2. I know that in all things you are able, [3is powerless 1and 4to you 2nothing].

3. For who is the one hiding you counsel, and sparing words, and [3you 1imagines 2to hide]? And who announces to me things which I knew not, great and wonderful, things which I had no knowledge?

4. But hear me, O lord! for I also shall speak. And I will ask you, and you teach me!

5. Hearing indeed in my ear, I heard of you  formerly; but now  my eye sees you.

6. Therefore I treated [2as worthless 1myself], and I was melted away; and I esteem myself earth and ashes. 

7.  Job Acquitted And it came to pass after the [2speaking  1 lord] all  these words  to Job, [3said 1the 2 lord] to Eliphaz the Temanite, You sinned and  [2two 3friends 1your], [3not 1for 2you spoke 5before 6me 7true 4anything], as  my attendant Job.

8. And now, take seven calves, and seven rams, and go to  my attendant Job! and he shall offer a yield offering for you, for in no way [2of his face 1shall I receive], for but on account of him I would have destroyed you. [3not 1For 2you did] speak true concerning  my attendant Job.

9. And they went -- Eliphaz the Temanite, and Baldad the Shuhite, and Sophar the Minean. And they went as [3ordered 4them 1the 2 lord], and he dismissed  their sin because of Job. 

10.  The LORD Gives Job Double And the lord increased  Job. [3making a vow 1And 2of his] and because of being  his friends he forgave to them the sin. [4gave 1And 2the 3 lord] double, as much as was Job's before, by doubling.

11. [6heard 1And 2all  3his brothers 4and  5his sisters] all the things coming to pass to him. And came to him even all as many as knew him at first. And eating and drinking with him, they comforted him. And they wondered upon all which [3brought 4upon 5him 1the 2 lord]. [2they 4gave 1And 5to him 3each 7ewe-lamb 6one], and a four-drachma [2gold 1piece of unmarked].

12. And the lord blessed the latter end of Job than the former. [4was 1And  3cattle 2his] -- [3sheep 1ten thousand 2four thousand], [2camels 1six thousand], [2teams 3of oxen 1a thousand], [4donkeys 2female 3grazing 1a thousand].

13. And there were born to him [2sons 1seven] and [2daughters 1three].

14. And he called the  first, Day, and the second, Keziah, and the third, Amalthaia's Horn.

15. And there were not found according to the daughters of Job better than they among the places  under heaven. [4gave 1And 5to them 2their 3father] an inheritance among the brethren.

16. [3lived 1And 2Job] after the calamity [3years 1a hundred 2forty]. And Job saw  his sons, and the sons  of his sons, to the fourth generation.

17. And Job came to an end an old man and full of days.
