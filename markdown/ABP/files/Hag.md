## Haggai 1

1.  The Order to Build the House In the second year of Darius the king, in the [2month  1sixth], day one of the month, came the word of the lord by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying, Say to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, from the tribe of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech the [2priest  1great], saying,

2. Thus says the lord almighty, saying,  This people say, [3is not 4come 1The 2time]  to build the house of the lord.

3. And came to pass the word of the lord by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying,

4. Is [2indeed 3time 4for you 1it]  to live in [3houses 1your 2vaulted],  but this house is quite desolate?

5. And now, thus says the lord almighty, Arrange your hearts for  your journeys!

6. You sowed much, and carried in little; you ate and not unto fullness; you drank and not unto intoxication; you clothed yourselves, and were not heated by these; and the one of the ones [2wages 1gathering] gathered them in a bundle having holes being made in it.

7. Thus says the lord almighty, Establish  your hearts for  your journeys!

8. Ascend into the mountain, and cut wood! and you shall build the house. And I will think well by it, and I will be glorified, said the lord.

9. You looked for much, and there became little; and it was carried into the house, and I blew it away. On account of this, thus says the lord almighty, Because  my house is deserted, and you [2pursue 1each] unto  his own house.

10. On account of this [3withholds 1the 2heaven] of dew, and the earth keeps back  its resources.

11. And I will bring the broadsword upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the wine, and upon the olive oil, and as much as [3brings forth 1the 2earth], and upon the men, and upon the cattle, and upon all the toils  of their hands.

12. And they heard (Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel from the tribe of Judah, and Joshua the son of Josedech the [2priest  1great], and all the rest of the people) the voice of the lord  their God, and the words  of Haggai the prophet, in so far as what [3sent 4him 1the lord  2their God] for them. And [3feared 1the 2people] from in front of the lord.

13. And [5said 1Haggai 2the 3messenger 4of the lord] among the messengers of the lord, Say to the people! I am with you, says the lord.

14. And the lord awakened the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel from the tribe of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech the [2priest  1great], and the spirit of the rest of the people. And they entered and did the works in the house of the lord almighty, their God,

15. on the fourth and twentieth day of the [2month  1sixth], in the second year  of Darius the king.  

## Haggai 2

1.  The Glory of the House In the seventh month, one and twentieth day of the month, came to pass the word of the lord by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying,

2. Speak indeed to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel of the tribe of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech the [2priest  1great], and to all the ones left of the people, saying,

3. Who is there of you who beheld  this house in the [2glory 3of it  1former]? And how do you see it now? Is it as not existing before you?

4. And now, take strength, O Zerubbabel, says the lord! And take strength, O Joshua,  son of Josedech the [2priest  1great]! and let [6grow strong 1all 2the 3people 4of the 5land]! says the lord, and act! For I [2with 3you 1am], says the lord almighty.

5. The word which I ordained with you in  your coming forth from Egypt, and  my spirit I set in the midst of you -- take courage!

6. For thus says the lord almighty, Still once I shall shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.

7. And I shall shake all the nations. And [6shall come 1the 2chosen 3of all 4the 5nations], and I will fill  this house with glory, says the lord almighty.

8. Mine is the silver, and mine is the gold, says the lord almighty.

9. For great will be the glory  of this house, the last one above the first, says the lord almighty. And in  this place I will establish peace, says the lord almighty; even peace of soul for the procurement to every one  creating  to raise up  this temple. 

10.  The Defiled Condition of the People In the fourth and twentieth day in the ninth month, in the [2year 1second] of Darius, came to pass the word of the lord to Haggai the prophet, saying,

11. Thus says the lord almighty, Ask indeed of the priests concerning the law! saying,

12. If [2took 1a man 4meat 3holy] with the tip  of his garment, and there touched the tip  of his garment some bread, or stew, or wine, or olive oil, or any food, shall it be sanctified? And [3answered 1the 2priests] and said, No.

13. And Haggai said, If [2should touch 1one being defiled] upon a dead soul of any of these, shall he be defiled? And [3answered 1the 2priests] and said, He shall be defiled.

14. And Haggai answered and said, So  this people, and so  this nation is before me, says the lord; and so all the works  of their hands; and whoever should approach unto there shall be defiled; because of  their concerns of the early morning burdens; they shall grieve from in front of their wickednesses; and you detested the ones [2at 3the doors 1reproving].

15. And now, set it indeed upon  your hearts from  this day and above, before  putting stone upon stone in the temple of the lord,

16. what you were when you put into the granary [3of barley 1twenty 2seahs], and there existed only ten seahs of barley. And you entered into the wine-vat to draw out fifty measures, and there existed only twenty.

17. I struck you with being non-productive, and with being wind-blown, and with hail upon all the works  of your hands; and you did not turn to me, says the lord.

18. Arrange indeed  your hearts from  this day and beyond! From the fourth and twentieth day of the ninth month, and from the day of which [4was laid a foundation 1the 2temple 3of the lord], establish it in  your hearts!

19. Shall yet it be recognized upon the threshing-floor, no. And shall yet the grapevine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the trees of the olive, the ones not bearing fruit be recognized, no. From  this day I shall bless. 

20.  Zerubbabel Chosen And came to pass the word of the lord the second time to Haggai the prophet, the fourth and twentieth day of the month, saying,

21. Speak to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, of the tribe of Judah, saying, I shall shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.

22. And I shall eradicate thrones of kings, and I shall annihilate the power of kings of the nations. And I shall eradicate chariots and riders. And there shall come down horses and their riders, each with a broadsword against  his brother.

23. In  that day, says the lord almighty, I will take you Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel  my servant, says the lord, and I will set you as a seal. For I have selected you, says the lord almighty.
