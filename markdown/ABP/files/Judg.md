## Judges 1

1.  Israel Wars with the Canaanites And it came to pass after the decease of Joshua, that [4asked 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in the lord, saying, Who shall ascend with us against the Canaanite guiding  to wage war against them.

2. And the lord said, Judah shall ascend; behold, I have put the land in his hand.

3. And Judah said to Simeon  his brother, Ascend with me unto  my lot, for we should wage war with the Canaanite, and I shall go also with you unto  your lot. And [2went 3with 4him 1Simeon].

4. And Judah ascended. And the lord gave the Canaanite and the Perizzite into his hand; and they struck them in Bezek -- ten thousand men.

5. And they found  Adoni-bezek in Bezek. And they waged war with him, and they struck the Canaanite and the Perizzite.

6. And Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and took him, and cut off the thumbs  of his hands, and the big toes  of his feet.

7. And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings the thumbs  of their hands, and the big toes  of their feet being cut off were collected together  underneath  my table. As then I did, so [2recompensed 3to me  1God]. And they led him unto Jerusalem, and he died there.

8. And [4waged war 1the 2sons 3of Judah] with Jerusalem, and overtook it, and struck it by the mouth of the broadsword, and the city they burnt with fire.

9. And after these things [4went down 1the 2sons 3of Judah] to wage war with the Canaanite  dwelling the mountainous area, and the south, and the plain country.

10. And Judah went to the Canaanite  dwelling in Hebron; and the name Hebron was  formerly Kirjath-arba. And they struck  Sheshai, and Ahiman, and  Talmai, offspring of the Anak.

11. And they went from there to the ones dwelling in Debir; and the name  Debir was formerly Kirjath-sepher -- City of Letters.

12. And Caleb said, Who ever should strike the City  of Letters, and be first to take it, I will give to him  Achsah my daughter for a wife.

13. And first to take it was Othniel son of Kenaz, [3brother 4of Caleb 1the 2younger]. And he gave to him  Achsah his daughter for a wife.

14. And it came to pass in  her entering, that he stirred her  to ask for [2from  3her father 1a field]. And she grumbled upon  her beast of burden. And [2said 3to her 1Caleb], What is it with you?

15. And [2said 3to him 1Achsah], Give indeed to me a blessing, for into the land of the south you have handed me over, and you shall give to me a ransoming of water. And [2gave 3to her 1Caleb] the ransom of the elevated springs, and the ransom of the ones below.

16. And the sons of Jothor the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, ascended from out of the city of the palms to the sons of Judah, into the wilderness of Judah, the one being in the south upon the descent of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.

17. And Judah went with Simeon  his brother, and they struck the Canaanite  dwelling in Zephath, and they devoted it to consumption, and utterly destroyed it. And they called the name of the city, Devastation.

18. And Judah inherited  Gaza and  her border; and  Ekron and  her border, and  Ashkelon and  her border and  Ashdod and  her outskirts.

19. And the lord was with Judah; and he inherited the mountain, for he was not able to inherit the ones dwelling in the valley, for it was separated to them, and there were chariots of iron to them.

20. And they gave [2to 3Caleb  1Hebron], as Moses spoke. And he removed there the three sons of Anak.

21. And [5the 6Jebusite  7dwelling 8Jerusalem 4did not remove 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin]. And [3dwelt 1the 2Jebusite] with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem until  this day.

22. And [4ascended 1the 2sons 3of Joseph], and indeed they went into Beth-el, and the lord was with them.

23. And they camped, and surveyed Beth-el; and the name of the city was formerly Luz.

24. And [3beheld 1the 2ones keeping guard] a man going forth from out of the city, and they took him, and they said to him, Show to us the entrance of the city, and we will deal [2with 3you 1mercifully].

25. And he showed to them the entrance of the city; and they struck the city by the mouth of the broadsword; but the man and  his kin they sent out.

26. And [3went forth 1the 2man] into the land of the Hittite, and he built there a city, and he called the name of it, Luz; this is its name until  this day.

27. And [2did not 3remove 1Manasseh]  Beth-shean nor  its daughter towns, nor Taanach and  her daughter towns, nor the ones dwelling in Dor and  her daughter towns, nor the ones dwelling Megiddo and  her daughter towns, nor the ones dwelling Ibleam nor  her daughter towns. And [3began 1the 2Canaanite] to dwell in  this land.

28. And it came to pass when Israel grew in strength, that he established the Canaanite for tribute, but by removing he did not remove him.

29. And Ephraim did not remove the Canaanite  dwelling in Gezer; and [3dwelt 1the 2Canaanite] in the midst of him in Gezer.

30. And Zebulun did not remove the ones dwelling in Kitron, and the ones dwelling Nahalol. And [3dwelt 1the 2Canaanite] in the midst of them, and it became for tribute.

31. And Asher did not remove the ones dwelling Accho, and the ones dwelling Sidon, and the ones dwelling Ahlab, and  Achzib, and  Helbah, and  Aphik, and  Rehob.

32. And Asher dwelt in the midst of the Canaanite  dwelling in the land; for he was not able to remove him.

33. And Naphtali did not remove the ones dwelling in Beth-shemesh, and the ones dwelling in Beth-anath. And Naphtali dwelt in the midst of the Canaanite  dwelling in the land. But the ones dwelling in Beth-shemesh and  in Beth-anath became to them for tribute.

34. And [3squeezed out 1the 2Amorite] the sons of Dan into the mountain; for they did not let him go down into the valley.

35. And [3began 1the 2Amorite] to dwell in  mount  Heres of which the bears and the foxes are; and [5was oppressive 1the 2hand 3of the house 4of Joseph] upon the Amorite, and he became for tribute.

36. And the border of the Amorite was from the ascending of Akrabbim, from the rock, and above.  

## Judges 2

1.  An Angel Rebukes the House of Israel And ascended an angel of the lord from Gilgal, unto the Place of Weeping. And he said to them, The lord transported you from Egypt, and brought you into the land which he swore by an oath to your fathers  to give to you. And he said, I shall not efface  my covenant with you into the eon.

2. And you shall not ordain a covenant with the ones lying in wait in  this land, nor [3to 4their gods 1in any way 2shall you do obeisance]; but  their carved idols break, and  their altars raze! And you hearkened not to  my voice, nor [2these things 1did you do].

3. And I said, In no way shall I remove them from your face; and they will be to you for conflict, and  their gods will be to you as an obstacle.

4. And it came to pass as [4spoke 1the 2angel 3of the lord]  these words to all the sons of Israel, that [3lifted up 1the 2people]  their voices, and wept.

5. Therefore he called the name  of that place, Weeping. And they sacrificed there to the lord. 

6.  Joshua Dies And Joshua sent out the people, and [5departed 1the 2sons 3of Israel 4each] to  his place, and to  his inheritance, to inherit the land.

7. And [3served 1the 2people] to the lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders, as many as prolonged their days with Joshua, as many as knew every  [2work 3of the lord  1great] which he did  to Israel.

8. And [4came to an end  1Joshua 2the son 3of Nun], a servant of the lord, a son of a hundred ten years.

9. And they entombed him in the border  of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in mount Ephraim, from the north  of mount Gaash.

10. And indeed all  that generation was added to  their fathers. And [3rose up 2generation 1another] after them which did not know the lord, and indeed the work which he did  to Israel. 

11.  Israel Serves Other Gods And [4acted 1the 2sons 3of Israel]  wickedly before the lord, and they served to the Baalim.

12. And they abandoned the lord  God  of their fathers, the one leading them out of the land of Egypt, and they went after other gods of the gods of the peoples  surrounding them; and they did obeisance to them, and provoked [3to anger 1the 2 lord].

13. And they abandoned the lord, and served to Baal and to the Ashtoreths.

14. And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] with  Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of ones despoiling, and they carried [2away captive 1them]. And he gave them into the hand  of their enemies round about, and they were not able to oppose against the face  of their enemies.

15. In all wherever they went, even the hand of the lord was against them for bad, as the lord said, and as the lord swore to them; and he squeezed them exceedingly.

16. And the lord raised up judges, and [2delivered 3them 1the lord] from the hand of the ones despoiling them. And  [2their judges 1they obeyed not],

17. for they fornicated after other gods, and did obeisance to them, and provoked [3to anger 1the 2 lord]. And they turned aside quickly from the way of which [2went  1their fathers],  listening to the commandments of the lord; they did not do so.

18. And when the lord raised up to them judges, then the lord was with the judge, and he delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For [2was moved to comfort 1the lord] because of  their moaning from in front of the ones assaulting them and afflicting them.

19. And it came to pass as [3died 1the 2judge], that they turned back, and again corrupted themselves above  their fathers, to go after other gods, and to serve them, and to do obeisance to them. They did not disown  their practices, and of  [3way 1their  2recalcitrant].

20. And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] with  Israel. And he said, Because of as much as [2abandoned  1this nation]  my covenant which I gave charge to their fathers, and hearkened not to  my voice,

21. then I shall not proceed  to remove a man before their presence from the nations whom were left behind by Joshua.

22. And he allowed  to test [2by 3him  1Israel], if they guard the way of the lord, to go by it in which manner [2guarded  1their fathers], or not.

23. And the lord left  these nations so as to not remove them  quickly; and he did not deliver them into the hand of Joshua.  

## Judges 3

1.  Nations Are Left to Test Israel And these are the nations which the lord left with them so as to test [2by 3them  1Israel], all the ones not knowing all the wars of Canaan,

2. this was only for the sake of the generations of the sons of Israel,  to teach them war, except the ones before them did not know them,

3. namely the five satrapies of the Philistines, and every  Canaanite, and the Sidonian, and the Hivite  dwelling  in Lebanon, from  mount  Baal-hermon unto Hamath.

4. And it happened so as to test [2by 3them  1Israel], to know if they will hearken to the commandments of the lord which he gave charge to their fathers by the hand of Moses.

5. And the sons of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

6. And they took  their daughters unto themselves for wives, and  their daughters they gave to their sons, and they served  their gods.

7. And [4acted 1the 2sons 3of Israel]  wickedly before the lord, and they forgot the lord  their God, and they served to the Baalim, and to the sacred groves.

8. And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] with  Israel, and he gave them into the hands of Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria Mesopotamia. And [4served 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to him [2years 1eight]. 

9.  Othniel Judges Israel And [4cried out 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord, and the lord raised up a deliver  for Israel, and he delivered them --  Othniel son of Kenaz, brother of Caleb the one younger than him.

10. And [3came 4upon 5him 1spirit 2of the lord], and he judged  Israel, and he went unto the war. And the lord delivered [5into 6his hand  1Cushan-rishathaim 2king  3of Syria]; And he fortified  his hand against  Cushan-rishathaim.

11. And [3was tranquil 1the 2land] forty years, and [4died 1Othniel 2son 3of Kenaz].

12. And [4proceeded 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to do  wickedly before the lord. And the lord strengthened  Eglon king of Moab against  Israel, because  of their acting  wickedly before the lord.

13. And he brought together to himself all the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he went and struck  Israel, and inherited the city of the palms.

14. And [4served 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to Eglon king of Moab eighteen years. 

15.  Ehud Judges Israel And [4cried out 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord; and [2raised up 1the lord] to them a deliverer --  Ehud son of Gera, son  of Benjamin, a man ambidextrous. And [4sent 1the 2sons 3of Israel] gifts by his hand  to Eglon king of Moab.

16. And [2made 3for himself 1Ehud] a knife, double-edged, a span being the length of it; and he girded it under the uniform, upon  [2thigh  1his right].

17. And he brought the gifts  to Eglon king of Moab. And Eglon was a man [2fair weight 1of exceedingly].

18. And it came to pass as Ehud completed bringing the gifts, that he sent out the ones carrying the gifts,

19. and he returned from the carvings by  Gilgal. And Ehud said, [3word 1There is with me 2a secret] for you, O king. And Eglon said to him, Be silent! And went forth from him all the ones standing around him.

20. And Ehud entered to him, and he sat in  [2upper  3harvest room 1his] alone. And Ehud said, There is a word of God with me to you, O king. And [2rose up 3from 4the 5throne 1Eglon] near him.

21. And it happened together  in his rising up, that Ehud stretched out  [2hand  1his left] and took the knife from  [3thigh 1his  2right], and he stuck it into the belly of Eglon.

22. And he brought in addition also indeed the handle after the blade; and [3locked 1the 2fat] onto the blade, for he could not pull out the knife from out of  his belly.

23. And Ehud went forth into the antechamber; and he went forth by the things set in order, and locked the doors of the upper room by him, and wedged them.

24. And he went forth. And  his servants entered, and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were wedged. And they said, Perhaps [2with 3the chair 1he sits] in the voidance of the bedroom.

25. And they remained being ashamed. And behold, there was not  one opening the doors of the upper room. And they took the key, and they opened. And behold,  their master was fallen upon the ground having died.

26. And Ehud came through safe until they made a disruption. And there was not one paying attention to him. And he went by the carvings, and came through safe into Seirath.

27. And it came to pass when he came, that he trumped a horn in  mount Ephraim. and [4went down 5with 6him 1the 2sons 3of Israel] from the mountain, and he in front of them.

28. And he said to them, Come down after me, for [3delivered up 1the lord  2God]  our enemies  of Moab into our hand. And they went down after him, and first took the ford of the Jordan  of Moab, and they did not allow a man to pass over.

29. And they struck  Moab in  that time, about ten thousand men, all the warriors, and every man having power; and not [2came through safe  1a man].

30. And Moab felt shame in  that day under the hand of Israel; and [3was tranquil 1the 2land] eighty years.

31. And after him rose up Shamgar son of Anath, and he struck the Philistines up to six hundred men by the plowshare of the oxen; and he himself delivered  Israel.  

## Judges 4

1.  Deborah and Barak Judge Israel And [4proceeded 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to act  wickedly before the lord; and Ehud died.

2. And [2delivered 3them 1the lord] into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the ruler  of his force was Sisera, and he dwelt in Harosheth of the nations.

3. And [4cried out 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord, because nine hundred chariots of iron were his. And he afflicted  Israel by might for twenty years.

4. And Deborah, a woman prophetess, wife of Lapidoth -- she judged  Israel in  that time.

5. And she sat down under the palm of Deborah, between  Rama and between  Beth-el, in mount Ephraim; and [4ascended 5to 6her 1the 2sons 3of Israel] there  to be judged.

6. And Deborah sent and called  Barak son of Abinoam from out of Kedesh Naphtali. And she said to him, Did not [4give charge 1the lord  2God 3of Israel] to you, that, You shall go forth unto mount Tabor, and you shall take with yourself ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali, and of the sons of Zebulun?

7. And I shall bring to you at the rushing stream Kishon  Sisera ruler of the force of Jabin, and  his chariots, and  his multitude; and I will deliver him into  your hand.

8. And [2said 3to 4her 1Barak], If you should go with me, I will go; and if you should not go, will I not go.

9. And [2said 3to 4him 1Deborah], In going I will go with you. Except know that [3will not be 1the 2honor] yours in the way which you go; for by the hand of a woman the lord will deliver up  Sisera. And Deborah rose up and went with  Barak from out of Kedesh.

10. And Barak summoned  Zebulun and  Naphtali to Kedesh. And ascended by his feet ten thousand men; and Deborah ascended with him.

11. And the near ones of the Kenite were separated from Kena, from the sons of Hobab father-in-law of Moses. And he pitched  his tent by Oak of the ones Resting, which is next to Kedesh.

12. And it was announced to Sisera that [4ascended 1Barak 2son 3of Abinoam] unto mount Tabor.

13. And Sisera called all  his chariots -- nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people  with him, from Harosheth of the nations unto the rushing stream Kishon.

14. And Deborah said to Barak, Rise up! for this is the day in which the lord delivers  Sisera into your hand. Behold is not the lord gone in front of you? And Barak went down from  mount Tabor, and ten thousand men behind him.

15. And the lord startled  Sisera, and all  his chariots, and all  his camp, by the mouth of the broadsword before Barak. And Sisera came down from on top  of his chariot, and he fled by his feet.

16. And Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the camp unto Oak of the Nations. And [4fell 1all 2the camp 3of Sisera] by the mouth of the broadsword; there was not left behind even one.

17. And Sisera withdrew by his feet to the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and between the house of Heber the Kenite.

18. And Jael came forth for a meeting with Sisera, and she said to him, Turn aside, O my master, turn aside to me, do not fear! And he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with  her hide covering.

19. And Sisera said to her, Give a drink please to me, a little water! for I am thirsty. And she opened the leather bag of the milk, and she gave him to drink, and she covered  his person.

20. And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent! And it will be if a man should come to you, and should ask you, and should say to you, Is [2here 1a man]? That you shall say, There is not. 

21.  Jael Kills Sisera And [4took 1Jael 2the wife 3of Heber] the peg of the tent, and put the hammer in  her hand, and she entered to him tranquilly, and she hammered in the peg into  his cheek, and thrust it through into the ground. And he being startled was enveloped in darkness and died.

22. And, behold, Barak was pursuing  Sisera. And Jael came forth for meeting him, and she said to him, Come, and I will show to you the man whom you seek. And he entered with her. And behold, there was Sisera having fallen dead, and the peg in  his temple.

23. And [2abased  1God] in  that day  Jabin king of Canaan in front of the sons of Israel.

24. And [5went forth 1the hand 2of the 3sons 4of Israel] going, and hardening against Jabin king of Canaan, until of which time they utterly destroyed him.  

## Judges 5

1.  The Song of Deborah and Barak And [6sang 1Deborah 2and 3Barak 4son 5of Abinoam] in  that day, and said,

2. In the rule of chiefs in Israel, in resolve of people, bless the lord!

3. Hear, O kings! Give ear, O satraps! I [2to the 3 lord 1shall sing], and I shall strum to the God of Israel.

4. O lord, in  your exodus from Seir, in  your departing from out of the field of Edom, the earth was shaken, and indeed the heaven was disturbed, and the clouds dripped water.

5. Mountains shook from the face of the lord; this Sinai from the face of the lord God of Israel.

6. In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, [2failed 1the ways], and they went by short cuts. They went by ways being turned aside.

7. [5failed 1The 2ones dwelling 3in  4Israel], they failed until of which time Deborah rose up, that [2rose up 1a mother] in Israel.

8. They selected new gods, then [3waged war 1cities 2of rulers]; [3for protection 4of young women 1spears 2appeared], even a spear -- forty thousand in  Israel.

9.  My heart is with the things ordered  to Israel. The mighty of the people -- you bless the lord!

10. O ones mounting upon beasts of burden, upon covered royal chariots, sitting down upon a judgment seat, and going by the way -- utter!

11. A sound of the men playing music in the midst of ones making merry. There they shall give righteousness to the lord. O righteousness grow in strength in  Israel! Then shall go down into  his cities the people of the lord.

12. Awaken, awaken, O Deborah! Awaken, awaken! Speak with an ode! Rise up, O Barak! And take captive your captivity, O son of Abinoam!

13. Then [2was magnified  1his strength]. O lord abase to me the ones stronger than me! People Ephraim punished them in the valley. Your brother Benjamin among your peoples.

14. Ephraim rooted them out among  Amalek. After you, Benjamin, with  your peoples. Of me, Machir, they came down searching out; and from Zebulun growing in strength in chiefdom of the narrative of a scribe.

15. And the rulers were in Issachar with Deborah and Issachar; so Barak in the valley sent out his footmen in the divisions of Reuben -- in great restrictions of heart.

16. Why with me did you settle between the sheepfolds  to listen to whistlings arousing  to go through for the ones  of Reuben -- in great trackings out of heart?

17. Gilead [2on 3the 4other side 5of the 6Jordan 1encamped]. And Dan -- why does he sojourn in boats? Asher sojourns by the shore of seas, and at  his breaches he will encamp.

18. Zebulun -- a people berating their soul to death; and Naphtali was upon the heights of a field.

19. [2came 1Kings] and deployed; then [3waged war 1the kings 2of Canaan] in Taanach, at the water of Megiddo; a desire for wealth of silver they did not have.

20. From the heaven they deployed; the stars from  their order deployed against Sisera.

21. The rushing stream Kishon cast them out, the rushing stream of antiquity, the rushing stream Kishon; [4shall trample 5them 3soul 1my 2mighty].

22. Then they were impeded, the heels of horses [2with diligence 1were hastened] by his mighty ones.

23. Curse Meroz! said the angel of the lord. With a curse, curse every one  dwelling in it! for they came not to the help of the lord. The lord is a helper against warriors.

24. May she be blessed of women -- Jael wife of Heber the Kenite; above the women in the tent may she be blessed.

25. [3for water 1He asked 2her], and [2milk 1she gave] to him in a pan; [3of strong ones 1she drew near 2butter].

26.  [2her hand 3for 4a peg 1She stretched out], and her right for the hammer of a laborer; and she struck [2with a hammer 1Sisera]; she nailed his head; yes, she struck, she nailed his temple.

27. In between  her feet bowing he fell; he slept between her feet; he bent; he fell; in which he bent there he fell miserably.

28. Through the window [4looked 5and 6studied 1the 2mother 3of Sisera] -- through the latticed window. Why was [2late  1his chariot] to arrive? Why did [3pass time 1the track 2of his chariots]?

29. [3wise ladies 2leading 1Her] answered to her, and she returned her words to herself.

30. Shall they not find him dividing the spoils? Befriending friends to [2head ruler 1a mighty]. Spoils of dyed things for Sisera, spoils of dyed embroidery dipped. Dyed embroidered works,  [2for his neck 1spoils].

31. Thus may [3be destroyed 1all  2your enemies], O lord. And the ones loving him be as the rising of the sun in his power. And [3was quiet 1the 2land] forty years.  

## Judges 6

1.  Midian and Amalek Ascend against Israel And [4acted 1the 2sons 3of Israel]  wickedly before the lord, and [2delivered them over 1the lord] into the hand of Midian for seven years.

2. And [3prevailed 1the hand 2of Midian] against Israel. Because of the presence of Midian [4made 5for themselves 1the 2sons 3of Israel]  havens in the mountains, and in the caves, and in the fortresses.

3. And it came to pass when [3sowed 1a man 2of Israel], that there ascended up Midian and Amalek; even the sons of the east were ascending against them.

4. And they camped by them, and they ruined the resources of the land unto the coming unto Gaza. And there was not left behind support for life in Israel, even for the flock, and calf, and donkey.

5. For they and  their livestock ascended and  [2their tents 1they carried about with]; and they came as the locusts by multitude. And for them and  their camels there was no number. And they came in the land of Israel  to ruin it.

6. And Israel became poor, exceedingly, from the presence of Midian.

7. And [4cried out 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord. And it came to pass when [4cried out 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord on account of Midian,

8. the lord sent a man, a prophet, to the sons of Israel. And he said to them, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, I am the one bringing you up from Egypt, and I led you from the house of slavery;

9. and I rescued you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of all the ones afflicting you; and I cast them from your face, and I gave to you  their land.

10. And I said to you, I am the lord  your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in which you dwell in  their land. But you hearkened not to  my voice. 

11.  The Angel Appears unto Gideon And [3came 1an angel 2of the lord] and sat under the oak, the one being in Ophrah, the one of the [2of Joash 1father] of Ezri. And Gideon  his son beat [2with a rod 1wheat] in a wine-vat,  to flee from the face of Midian.

12. And [4appeared 5to him 1the 2angel 3of the lord], and said to him, The lord is with you mighty  in strength.

13. And [2said 3to 4him 1Gideon], Be it to me, O my Lord, and if the lord is with us, then why do [3find 4us 1all  2these bad things]? And where are all  his wonders, as many as [2described 3to us  1our fathers], saying, Is it not from out of Egypt [2led 3us 1the lord]? And now he thrust us away, and delivered us over into the hand of Midian.

14. And [4looked 5towards 6him 1the 2angel 3of the lord], and said to him, Go in  [2your strength 1this]! and you shall deliver  Israel. Behold, I send you.

15. And [2said 3to 4him 1Gideon], Be it to me, O my Lord, by what means shall I deliver  Israel? Behold,  my thousand is humbler in Manasseh, and I am the lesser in the house  of my father.

16. And [2said 3to 4him 1The lord] that, I will be with you, and you shall strike  Midian as [2man 1one].

17. And [2said 3to 4him 1Gideon], And if I found favor in your eyes, then you shall give to me a sign that you spoke with me.

18. In no way should you separate from here until  [2coming 1my] to you, and I shall bring  my sacrifice, and I shall sacrifice before you. And he said, I am settled until  you return.

19. And Gideon entered and prepared a kid of the goats, and an ephah [2flour 1of unleavened], and [2the 3meats 1he put] upon the bin, and the broth he poured into an earthen pot, and he brought it to him under the oak, and did obeisance.

20. And [4said 5to 6him 1the 2angel 3of the lord], Take the meats and the unleavened breads, and put them on  that rock, and [2the 3broth 1pour out]! And he did so.

21. And [4stretched out 1the 2angel 3of the lord] the tip of the rod  in  his hand, and touched of the meats, and of the unleavened breads; and [2was lit 1fire] from out of the rock, and it devoured the meats and the unleavened breads. And the angel of the lord departed from his eyes.

22. And Gideon knew that [2the angel 3of the lord 1it is]. And Gideon said, Alas, O my Lord, O lord, for I beheld the angel of the lord face to face.

23. And [2said 3to him 1the lord], Peace to you, do not fear, in no way shall you die.

24. And [2built 3there 1Gideon] an altar to the lord. And he called it, Peace of the lord, until  this day. It is still being with Ephratah father  of Ezri. 

25.  Gideon Demolishes the Altar of Baal And it came to pass in  that night, that [2said 3to him 1the lord], Take the [2calf  1well fed]  of your father, and the [2calf 1second] of seven years old! And you shall demolish the altar  of Baal which is  of your father; and the sacred grove  by it you shall cut down.

26. And you shall build an altar to the lord  your God, to the one appearing to you upon the top  [2mountain 3of Maoz 1of this] in the battle array. And you shall take with the [2calf  1second], and you shall offer whole burnt-offerings in the trees of the sacred grove which you cut down.

27. And Gideon took ten men from  his manservants, and he did as [2spoke 3to 4him 1the lord]. And it came to pass that he feared the household  of his father, and the men of the city,  so as to not act by day, and he acted it by night.

28. And [5rose early 1the 2men 3of the 4city] in the morning; and behold, [4was razed 1the 2altar  3of Baal], and the sacred grove  by it was cut down; and the [2calf  1well fed] was offered for a whole burnt-offering upon the altar  having been built.

29. And [2said 1each man] to  his neighbor, Who did  this thing? And they investigated and inquired. And they said, Gideon son of Joash did  this thing.

30. And [5said 1the 2men 3of the 4city] to Joash, Lead out  your son and let him die! for he razed the altar  of Baal, and because he cut down the sacred grove  by it.

31. And Joash said to the men  rising against him, Do you now adjudicate for  Baal? or shall you deliver him? Who ever pleaded to him let die in the morning. If [2God 1he is], he shall avenge for himself, for he razed  his altar.

32. And he called him in  that day, Jerubbaal, saying, The court of justice  of Baal, for he razed  his altar.

33. And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east came together at the same place, and they passed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel.

34. And spirit of God empowered  Gideon, and he trumped with the horn; and he called for aid to Abiezer after him.

35. And [2messengers 1he sent] to all Manasseh, and he called also himself others after him. And [2messengers 1he sent out] in Asher, and in Zebulun, and in Naphtali. And they ascended for meeting him. 

36.  Gideon's Fleece And Gideon said to  God, If you deliver [2by 3my hand  1Israel], as you spoke,

37. behold, I fasten the fleece  of wool pieces in the threshing-floor. And if dew comes upon the fleece only, and upon all the earth be dryness, then I will know that you shall deliver [2by 3my hand  1Israel] in which manner you spoke.

38. And it came to pass thus. And Gideon rose early on the next day, and he squeezed out the fleece, and [2dripped 1dew] from the fleece -- a full pan of water.

39. And Gideon said to  God, Let not [2be provoked to anger  1your rage] against me! for I will speak still once more, and I will test still once more by the fleece. And let there become yet dryness upon the fleece only, and upon all the ground let there become dew!

40. And God did so in  that night. And there was dryness upon the fleece only, and upon all the ground became dew.  

## Judges 7

1.  The LORD Chooses Three Hundred Men And Jerubbaal rose early (he is Gideon), and all the people with him. And they camped upon the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was to him from the north of the hill Moreh, in the valley.

2. And the lord said to  Gideon, [5are many 1The 2people  3with 4you] so as [2to not 3deliver up 1for me]  Midian into their hand, lest at any time Israel should boast instead of me, saying,  My hand delivered me.

3. And the lord said to him, Speak indeed into the ears of the people! saying, Any  one fearing and timid return! And they sallied out from  mount Gilead. And returned of the people twenty and two thousand, and ten thousand were left behind.

4. And the lord said to Gideon, Still the people are many, lead them down to the water! and I will try them for you there. And it will be whom ever I should tell to you, This one shall go with you -- he shall go with you. And all whom ever I should say that, He shall not go with you, then he shall not go with you.

5. And [3went down 1the 2people] to the water. And the lord said to Gideon, All who ever laps with his tongue of the water as if [3should lap 1the 2dog], you shall stand him alone. And all who ever bends upon  his knees  to drink, you shall remove him by himself.

6. And was the number of the ones lapping with  their tongue three hundred men. And all the remaining  people bent upon  their knees to drink water.

7. And the lord said to Gideon, By the three hundred men  lapping I shall deliver you, and I will put  Midian into your hand. And all the people ran, each man to  his place.

8. And they took the provision of the people in their hand, and  their horns. And every man of Israel he sent out to  his tent, and the three hundred men he kept. And the camp of Midian was underneath him in the valley.

9. And it came to pass in  that night, that [2said 3to 4him 1the lord], Rise up, go down into the camp! for I delivered it into  your hand.

10. And if you should fear [2by yourself 1to go down], [5go down 1then you 2and 3Phurah  4your servant] into the camp.

11. And you should hearken to what they speak, and after these things [2shall grow in strength  1your hands], and you shall go down in the camp. And he went down, he and Phurah  his servant, into a portion of the fifty companies of the ones in the camp.

12. And Midian and Amalek and all the sons of the east were encamped in the valley as locust in multitude; and [3to 4their camels 1there was no 2number], but they were as if the sand  upon the edge of the sea in multitude.

13. And Gideon came, and behold, a man was describing to his neighbor a dream. And he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream. And behold, a loaf of bread of barley was rolling in the camp of Midian, and it came unto the tent of Midian, and it struck it, and it overturned it, and [3fell 1the 2tent].

14. And [2answered  1his neighbor] and said, [2not 1This is] other than the broadsword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel. God delivered up [2into 3his hand  1Midian], and all the camp.

15. And it came to pass as Gideon heard the description of the dream, and  its interpretation, that he did obeisance to the lord, and he returned into the camp of Israel. And he said, Rise up! for the lord delivered up into your hands the camp of Midian.

16. And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put horns into the hand of all, and [2water-pitchers 1empty], and lamps in the middle of the water-pitchers.

17. And he said to them, Of me you shall see, and thus shall you do. And behold, I will enter into the midst of the camp, and it will be as whenever I shall act, so shall you act.

18. When I shall trump with the horn, I and all with me, then you shall trump with the horns round about the entire  camp, and you shall say, For the lord and  for Gideon.

19. And Gideon entered, and the hundred men, the ones with him, into the rank of the camp command of the guard of the middle watch; furthermore rising they roused the ones guarding. And they trumped the horns, and shook off the water-pitchers, the ones in  their hands.

20. And [4trumped 1the 2three 3companies] with the horns, and they broke the water-pitchers, and took [3in  5hand  4their left 1the 2lamps], and in  [2hand  1their right] was the horns  to trump. And they shouted aloud, A broadsword for the lord and for Gideon.

21. And they stood, each man by himself, round about the camp; and they ran around all the camp, and they signified by an alarm -- and they fled.

22. And they trumped the three hundred horns. And the lord placed [2sword 1every man's] against  his neighbor, even in the whole  camp. And [3fled 1the 2camp] unto  Beth-shittah Zererath, unto the edge of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.

23. And [3called for aid 1the man 2of Israel] of Naphtali, and of Asher, and of all Manasseh; and they pursued after Midian.

24. And [3messengers 2sent out 1Gideon] to every mountain of Ephraim, saying, Go down to meet Midian, and overtake for yourselves the water unto Beth-barah and the Jordan! And [4yelled out 1every 2man 3of Ephraim] and were first to take the water unto Beth-barah and the Jordan.

25. And they seized the two rulers of Midian --  Oreb and  Zeeb; and they killed  Oreb in Sur, and  Zeeb they killed in Jakeb Zeeb. And they pursued  Midian. And the head of Oreb, and of Zeeb they brought to Gideon from  the other side of the Jordan.  

## Judges 8

1.  Conflict with Ephraim And [3said 4to 5him 1a man 2of Ephraim], What  is this thing you do to us,  to not call us when you went to deploy against Midian? And they quarreled with him forcefully.

2. And he said to them, What did I do now as concerning you? Is not [3better 1the gleaning 2of Ephraim] than the gathering the crops of Abiezer?

3. In your hand [2delivered up 1the lord] the rulers of Midian --  Oreb and  Zeeb; and what was I able to do as you? Then [2was spared  1their spirit] towards them in  his speaking with them  this word. 

4.  Succoth and Penuel Refuse to Help And Gideon came upon the Jordan, and he passed over and the three hundred men, the ones with him, faint-hearted and hungering.

5. And he said to the men of Succoth, Give indeed bread loaves for the nourishment  to this people  with me! for they hunger, for I pursue after  Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

6. And [4said 1the 2rulers 3of Succoth], [5is not 1The hand 2of Zebah 3and 4Zalmunna] now in  your hand, that we should give [2to 3your military 1bread loaves].

7. And Gideon said,  Thus in the giving by the lord  Zebah and  Zalmunna into  my hand, that I will rend in shreds  your flesh with the thorn-bushes of the wilderness, and with the Barkenim.

8. And he ascended from there to Penuel, and spoke to them according to these things. And [4answered 5to him 1the 2men 3of Penuel] in which manner [4answered 5to him 1the 2men 3of Succoth].

9. And Gideon said to the men of Penuel, saying, In  my returning with peace, I will raze  this tower.

10. And Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and  their camp with them, about fifteen thousand, all the ones being left in all the camp of the sons of the east. And the ones falling were a hundred and twenty thousand men unsheathing the broadsword.

11. And Gideon ascended the way of the ones dwelling in tents from the east  of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he struck the camp. And the camp was secure.

12. And Zebah fled, and Zalmunna. And he pursued after them, and he took hold of the two kings of Midian,  Zebah and  Zalmunna, and all  their camp was startled.

13. And [4returned 1Gideon 2the son 3of Joash] from the battle from the ascent of Ares.

14. And he seized a servant from the men of Succoth, and he questioned him; and he registered for him the rulers of Succoth, and  their elders -- seventy and seven men.

15. And he came to the rulers of Succoth. And he said to them, Behold, Zebah and Zalmunna, by whom you berated me, saying, Not is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we will give [2to 3your men  4fainting 1bread loaves].

16. And he took the rulers and the elders of the city into the thorn-bushes of the wilderness, and the Barkenim, and he rent with them the men of Succoth.

17. And the tower of Penuel he razed, and he killed the men of the city.

18. And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner are the men whom you killed in Tabor? And they said, As you, so they are likened to you -- likened to them as the appearance of sons of kings.

19. And Gideon said, [3of my brothers 2sons  4of my mother 1They are]. As the lord lives, if you brought them forth alive, I would not have killed you.

20. And he said to Jether  his first-born, In rising up, you kill them! And [3did not 4unsheathe 1the 2boy]  his sword, for he feared, for he was younger.

21. And [4said 1Zebah 2and 3Zalmunna], You rise up indeed yourself and meet us! for as a man is, so also  his power. And Gideon rose up, and did away with  Zebah and  Zalmunna. And he took the crescents  on the necks  of their camels.

22. And [3said 1a man 2of Israel] to Gideon, Rule among us, you and  your son, and the son  of your son! for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.

23. And [2said 3to 4them 1Gideon], [2will not rule 1I] you, and [2will not rule  1my son] among you -- the lord shall rule you.

24. And [2said 3to 4them 1Gideon], I will ask from you a request, and you give to me -- every man an ear-ring of his spoils; for ear-rings of gold was to them, because they were Ismaelites.

25. And they said, In giving we will give. And he unfolded  his garment, and [2tossed 3there 1each man] an ear-ring of his spoils.

26. And was the weight of the ear-rings  of gold which he asked for -- [4shekels 1a thousand 2and 3seven hundred] of gold, besides the ornaments of the crescents, and the wrap around garments of the ones of purple, of the ones upon the kings of Midian, even besides the collars of the ones on the necks  of their camels. 

27.  Gideon's Legacy And [2made 3to himself 1Gideon] for an ephod, and set it in his city, in Ophrah. And [3fornicated 1all 2Israel] after it there. And it became [3to 4Gideon 5and  6his house 1an 2obstacle].

28. And Midian was in remorse before the sons of Israel, and they did not proceed yet to lift their head; and [3was tranquil 1the 2land] forty years in the days of Gideon.

29. And [4went 1Jerubbaal 2son 3of Joash] and dwelt in  his house.

30. And to Gideon there were seventy sons going forth from out of his thighs, for [3wives 2many 1there were] to him.

31. And  his concubine in Shechem, [2bore 3to him 4also 5indeed 1she] a son, and put upon him  his name -- Abimelech.

32. And [4died 1Gideon 2the son 3of Joash] with [2grayness of hair 1good]. And he was entombed in the burying-place of Joash  his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.

33. And it came to pass as Gideon died, that [4returned 1the 2sons 3of Israel] and fornicated after the Baalim, and established to themselves  Baal-berith for a covenant,  [2to be 3to them 1for him] for god.

34. And [4did not 5remember 1the 2sons 3of Israel] the lord  their God, the one rescuing them from out of the hand of all  their enemies round about.

35. And they did not do mercy with the house of Jerubbaal -- Gideon, according to all the goodness which he did with Israel.  

## Judges 9

1.  Abimelech Judges Israel And [5went 1Abimelech 2the 3son 4of Jerubbaal] into Shechem to the brothers  of his mother. And he spoke to them, and to all the kin of the house [2father 1of his mother's], saying,

2. Speak indeed into the ears of all the men of Shechem, saying, Which is best to you,  [3to rule 4you 1for seventy 2men], all the sons of Jerubbaal, or [3to dominate 4you 2man 1for one]? And you should remember that [2of your bone 3and 4of your flesh 1I am].

3. And [4spoke 5concerning 6him 1the 2brothers  3of his mother] in the ears of all of the men of Shechem all  these words. And [2leaned  1their heart] after Abimelech; for they said, [2our brother 1He is].

4. And they gave to him seventy pieces of silver from out of the house of Baal-berith; and [2hired 3for 4them 1Abimelech 8men 5vain 6and 7distraught], and they went behind him.

5. And he entered to the house  of his father at Ophrah, and he killed  his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men upon [2stone 1one]. But [6was left behind 1Jotham 4son 5of Jerubbaal 2the 3younger], for he was hidden.

6. And came together all the men of Shechem, and all the house of Millo, and they went and gave reign to  Abimelech as king at the acorn tree of the station, of the one in Shechem. 

7.  Jotham Addresses Shechem at Mount Gerizim And they announced  to Jotham, and he went, and stood on the top  of mount Gerizim, and he lifted up  his voice, and he called, and he said to them, Hear me men of Shechem! and [2shall hear 3you  1God].

8. In going, [3went forth 1the 2trees]  to anoint for themselves a king. And they said to the olive tree, You reign over us!

9. And [3said 4to them 1the 2olive tree], Allowing  my fatness which [3in 4me 2glorified  1God], and  men, shall I go to rule over the trees?

10. And [3said 1the 2trees] to the fig-tree, Come, you reign over us!

11. And [2said 3to them  1the fig-tree], Allowing  my sweetness and  [3produce 1my  2good], should I go to rule the trees?

12. And [3said 1the 2trees] to the grapevine, Come, you reign over us!

13. And [3said 4to them 1the 2grapevine], Allowing  my wine, the gladness  of God, and of the ones of men, should I go to rule over the trees?

14. And [4said 1all 2the 3trees] to the white-thorn shrub, Come, You reign over us!

15. And [3said 1the 2white-thorn shrub] to the trees, If in truth you anoint me yourselves  to reign over you, come rely in  my protection; and if not may [2come forth 1fire] from the white-thorn shrub, and may it devour the cedars  of Lebanon.

16. And now, if in truth and in soundness you made even Abimelech reign, and if [2well 1you did] with Jerubbaal, and with  his house, and if according to the recompense of his hand you did to him,

17. as [2waged war  1my father] for you, and tossed his life right opposite, and rescued you from out of the hand of Midian;

18. and you rose up against the house  of my father today, and you killed  his sons, seventy men upon [2stone 1one]; and you gave reign to  Abimelech the son  of his maidservant over the men of Shechem, because [2your brother 1he is];

19. and if [2in 3truth 4and 5perfection 1you acted] with Jerubbaal, and  his house in  this day, may you be glad in Abimelech, and may he be glad also indeed himself in you.

20. If not, may [2come forth 1fire] from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house Millo; and may [2come forth 1fire] from the men of Shechem, and from out of the house of Millo, and devour  Abimelech.

21. And Jotham ran away and fled, and went unto Beer, and dwelt there away from the face of Abimelech  his brother.

22. And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. 

23.  Shechem Annuls Allegiance with Abimelech And God sent [2spirit 1a bad] between Abimelech and between the men of Shechem; and [4annulled allegiance 1the 2men 3of Shechem] with the house of Abimelech;

24. so as to bring the injustice done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, and  for their blood to be put upon Abimelech  their brother the one killing them; and upon the men of Shechem, of the ones strengthening  their hands so as to kill  his brothers.

25. And [4put 5for him 1the 2men 3of Shechem] ones lying in wait upon the top of the mountains. And they kidnapped all the ones going along by them in the way; and it was reported  to Abimelech.

26. And [4came 1Gaal 2the son 3of Ebed] and  his brothers, and they went unto Shechem; and [4relied 5in 6him 1the 2men 3of Shechem].

27. And they went forth into the field, and gathered the vintage  of their vineyards, and they treaded, and they made a dance, and they entered into the house of their god, and they ate and drank, and they cursed  Abimelech.

28. And [4said 1Gaal 2son 3of Ebed], Who is Abimelech, and who is the son of Shechem, that we shall serve to him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and Zebul his overseer, his manservant with the men of Hamor, father of Shechem? And why is it that we shall serve to him ourselves?

29. And if any should give  this people into my hand, then I shall remove  Abimelech. And I shall say to Abimelech, Multiply  your force, and come forth!

30. And [6heard 1Zebul 2the 3ruler 4of the 5city] the words of Gaal son of Ebed, and he was enraged in anger.

31. And he sent messengers to Abimelech with bribes, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed, and  his brothers have come unto Shechem; and know, they assault the city against you.

32. And now rise up at night, you and the people  with you, and lie in wait in the field!

33. And it will be in the morning, together with the rising of the sun, that you shall rise early and stretch out against the city. And behold, he and the people  with him go forth against you, and you shall do to him just as [2should find opportunity  1your hand].

34. And Abimelech rose up, and all the people  with him at night, and they laid in wait at Shechem -- four companies.

35. And [4came forth 1Gaal 2son 3of Ebed], and he stood at the door of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and all the people  with him, from the ambush.

36. And [4saw 1Gaal 2son 3of Ebed] the people. And he said to Zebul, Behold, a people coming from the tops of the mountains. And [2said 3to 4him 1Zebul], The shadow of the mountains you see as men.

37. And [2proceeded 3still 1Gaal]  to speak, and said, Behold, a people coming down as a sea from the part next to the navel of the earth, and [2company 1one] arrives from the way of the Oak of the Seers.

38. And [2said 3to 4him 1Zebul], Where is  your mouth, the one saying, Who is Abimelech, that we will serve him? [2not 1Is this] the people whom you treated with contempt? Go forth indeed now and wage war with him! 

39.  Shechem Wars with Abimelech And Gaal went forth from the presence of the men of Shechem, and he made war against Abimelech.

40. And [2pursued 3him 1Abimelech], and he fled from his face, and there fell slain many unto the doors of the city.

41. And Abimelech settled in Arumah, and Zebul cast out  Gaal and  his brethren,  so as to not live in Shechem.

42. And it came to pass in the next day, and came forth the people into the plain, and reported  to Abimelech.

43. And he took the people, and he divided them into three companies, and he laid in wait in the field. And he watched, and behold, a people came forth from out of the city, and he rose up against them and struck them.

44. And Abimelech and companies, the ones with him, stretched out and stood by the door of the gate of the city, and the two companies poured out upon all the ones in the field, and he struck them.

45. And Abimelech made war against the city [2entire  3day 1that]. And they overtook the city, and the people  in it they killed; and he demolished the city and sowed it with salt.

46. And [7heard 1all 2the 3men 4of the 5tower 6of Shechem], and they entered into the fortress of the house of Bethel-berith.

47. And it was announced  to Abimelech that [7were brought together 1all 2the 3men 4of the 5tower 6of Shechem].

48. And Abimelech ascended into mount Zalmon, he and all the people  with him. And Abimelech took the axe in  his hand, and he cut a load of wood, and he took it, and put it upon  his shoulders. And he said to the people  with him, What you see me doing, quickly you do as also I! 

49.  Abimelech Seizes Shechem and Thebez And they felled wood. And indeed to them all each was a load. And they lifted, and they went after Abimelech. And they placed the wood at the fortress, and they set fire to them at the fortress with fire. And all died, the men of the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women.

50. And Abimelech went unto Thebez, and besieged it, and first took it.

51. And [3tower 2a strong 1there was] in the midst of the city. And fled there all the men, and the women, and all the leaders of the city. And they shut up themselves, and ascended upon the roof of the tower.

52. And Abimelech came unto the tower, and they subdued it by war. And Abimelech approached unto the door of the tower  to burn it with fire. 

53.  Abimelech Killed by a Millstone And [2tossed 1a woman] one piece of millstone upon the head of Abimelech, and it fractured  his skull.

54. And he yelled out  quickly to the servant  lifting  his weapons. And he said to him, Unsheathe  my broadsword and kill me! lest at any time they should say that, A woman killed him. And [2stabbed 3him  1his servant], and he died.

55. And [3saw 1each man 2of Israel] that Abimelech died, and [2departed 1each man] to  his place.

56. And God returned the evil of Abimelech, which he did to his father, by killing  [2seventy 3brothers 1his].

57. And all the evil of the men of Shechem, God returned on  their own head. And came upon them the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.  

## Judges 10

1.  Tola and Jair Judge Israel And rose up after Abimelech  to deliver  Israel, Tola son of Phua, son of his uncle, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.

2. And he judged  Israel twenty and three years, and he died, and he was entombed in Shamir.

3. And rose up after him Jair the Gileadite; and he judged  Israel twenty and two years.

4. And there were born to him thirty sons mounted upon thirty foals. And thirty cities were his, and they called them, Properties of Jair until  this day, the ones which are in the land of Gilead.

5. And Jair died and was entombed in Camon. 

6.  Israel Afflicted by the Nations And [4proceeded 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to do  wickedly before the lord, and they served to the Baalim, and to the Ashtaroths, and to the gods of Syria, and to the gods of Sidon, and to the gods of Moab, and to the gods of the sons of Ammon, and to the gods of the Philistines; and they abandoned the lord, and did not serve to him.

7. And [2was enraged 3in anger 1the lord] against  Israel, and he gave them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the sons of Ammon.

8. And they disintegrated and crushed the sons of Israel in  that time -- eighteen years, all of the sons of Israel  on the other side of the Jordan, in the land of the Amorite, in  Gilead.

9. And [4passed over 1the 2sons 3of Ammon] the Jordan to wage war even against  Judah and Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; and they afflicted the sons of Israel exceedingly.

10. And [4cried out 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord, saying, We sinned against you, for we abandoned  our God, and we served to the Baalim.

11. And the lord said to the sons of Israel, Is it not the Egyptians, and the Amorites, and the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and the Philistines,

12. and Sidonians, and Amalek, and Canaan that squeeze you out? and you cried out to me, and I delivered you from out of their hand.

13. And you abandoned me, and served other gods. On account of this I will not proceed  to deliver you.

14. Proceed and yell to the gods whom you chose for yourselves, and let them deliver you in the time of your affliction!

15. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord, We sinned, do to us according to all whatever as much as should be pleasing before you, only rescue us in  this day!

16. And they removed  [3gods 1the 2alien] from their midst, and they served to the lord. And he was faint-hearted over the toil of Israel.

17. And there ascended up the sons of Ammon, and they camped in Gilead. And [4came forth 1the 2sons 3of Israel] and camped in Mizpeh.

18. And [3said 1the 2people], and the rulers of Gilead, each man to  his neighbor, Who is the man who shall begin to wage war with the sons of Ammon, for he shall be head to all the ones dwelling in Gilead?  

## Judges 11

1.  Jephthah Judges Israel And Jephthah the Gileadite was mighty in strength. And he was the son [2woman 1of a harlot]. And she bore [2to 3Gilead  1Jephthah].

2. And [3bore 1the 2wife] to Gilead himself sons. And [5matured 1the 2sons 3of the 4woman], and they cast out  Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit among the house  of our father, for [3a son 5woman 4of a mistress 1you 2are].

3. And Jephthah ran away from the face  of his brothers, and he dwelt in the land of Tob. And [3collected together 4with  5Jephthah 2men 1cheap], and went forth together with him.

4. And it came to pass after some days, that [4waged war 1the 2sons 3of Ammon] against Israel. And it came to pass when [4waged war 1the 2sons 3of Ammon] with Israel,

5. that [4went forth 1the 2elders 3of Gilead] to take  Jephthah from the land of Tob.

6. And they said to Jephthah, Come, and you will be to us as a leader, for we shall make war with the sons of Ammon.

7. And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did you not detest me, and cast me from out of the house  of my father, and sent me from you? And why is it that you came to me now when you are afflicted?

8. And [4said 1the 2elders 3of Gilead] to Jephthah, Not so, now we gathered together to you, and you shall go with us, and we shall wage war against the sons of Ammon, and you will be to us as head to all the ones dwelling in Gilead.

9. And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you return me to yourselves to make war against the sons of Ammon, and [2should deliver 1the lord] them before me, I will be to you for head ruler.

10. And [4said 1the 2elders 3of Gilead] to Jephthah, Let the lord be the one hearing between us! if we do not do according to  your word thus we will do.

11. And Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and [3established 1the 2people] him over them as head, and for leader. And Jephthah spoke all  his words before the lord in Mizpeh.

12. And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, What is it to me and to you, that you come to me  to wage war in  my land?

13. And [4said 1the king 2of the sons 3of Ammon] to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took  my land in  their ascending from out of Egypt, from Arnon unto Jabok, and unto the Jordan. And now return them with peace!

14. And [2added 1Jephthah again], and he sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon.

15. And they said to him, Thus says Jephthah, [2did not 3take 1Israel] the land of Moab, and the land of the sons of Ammon.

16. In  their ascending from out of Egypt, it is that Israel went in the wilderness unto [2sea 1the red], and came to Kadesh.

17. And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, I shall go through  your land. And [3did not 4hearken 1the king 2of Edom], and indeed to the king of Moab Israel sent, and he would not, and Israel settled in Kadesh.

18. And Israel went through in the wilderness, and encircled the land of Edom and the land of Moab. And it arrived according to the rising of the sun of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of Arnon, and did not enter into the border of Moab.

19. And [2sent 3messengers 1Israel] to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon. And [2said 3to him 1Israel], I shall go by through  your land unto  my place.

20. And [2did not 3want 1Sihon]  Israel to go through  his borders. And Sihon gathered all  his people, and they camped at Jahaz, and he waged war with Israel.

21. And [4delivered up 1the lord  2God 3of Israel]  Sihon and all  his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and Israel inherited all the land of the Amorites  dwelling in  that land.

22. And Israel inherited all the border of the Amorites, from Arnon and unto the Jabok, and from the wilderness unto the Jordan.

23. And now the lord  God of Israel lifted away the Amorite from the face of his people Israel, and you, shall you inherit it?

24. Is it not that as much as [3allots 4to you 1Chemosh  2your god], them you will inherit? And all as much as [3inherits 1the lord  2our God] from your person we shall inherit them.

25. And now [3any better 1are 2you] than Balak son of Sephor king of Moab? Did he with battle do combat with Israel, or by war wage war with them?

26. In the living of Israel in Heshbon, and in  her daughter cities, and in Aroer, and in  her daughter cities, and in all the cities  by the Jordan for three hundred years -- Why is it that you did not rescue them in  that time?

27. And I sinned not against you, but you do [2with 3me 1wickedness]  to wage war against me. May the lord judge, the one judging today, between the sons of Israel and between the sons of Ammon.

28. And [4would not 5hearken to 1the king 2of the sons 3of Ammon] the words of Jephthah which he sent to him.

29. And [3became 4upon 5Jephthah 1spirit 2of the lord], and he passed over  Gilead, and  Manasseh, and he passed over the height of Gilead, and from the height of Gilead to the other side of the sons of Ammon. 

30.  Jephthah's Vow And Jephthah vowed a vow to the lord, and he said, If by delivering up you should deliver up the sons of Ammon in my hand,

31. then it will be concerning the one going forth, who ever might come from the doors  of my house for meeting me in  my returning in peace from the sons of Ammon, that it will be to the lord, and I will offer him a whole burnt-offering.

32. And Jephthah passed over to the sons of Ammon  to wage war against them. And [2delivered 3them 1the lord] into his hand.

33. And he struck them from Aroer even unto the coming to Minnith -- twenty cities, and unto the Abel vineyards, [3beating 2great 1an exceedingly]. And [4showed respect 1the 2sons 3of Ammon] in front of the sons of Israel.

34. And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to  his house. And behold,  his daughter went forth for meeting him with tambourines and dancers, and she was an only child. And there was not to him [4besides 5her 1a son 2or 3daughter].

35. And it happened when he beheld her, that he tore  his garments, and said, Alas my daughter you impede me, for [2an impediment 1you became] in my eyes, and I opened  my mouth concerning you to the lord, and I shall not be able  to turn back.

36. And she said to him, If about me you opened  your mouth to the lord, let him do to me in which manner it came forth from out of  your mouth, because [2did 4for you 1the lord 3vengeance] on  your enemies, of the sons of Ammon.

37. And she said to  her father, And do to me  this thing! Allow me two months and I shall go and shall come down upon the mountains, and I shall weep over the tokens of my virginity, I and  my female companions.

38. And he said, Go! And he sent her out for two months. And she went, she and  her female companions. And they wept over the tokens of her virginity upon the mountains.

39. And it came to pass after the end of the two months, that she returned to  her father, and Jephthah completed  his vow which he vowed. And she did not know a man. And it became an order in Israel,

40. from days unto days [4go with one another 1the 2daughters 3of Israel] to wail over the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite  four days in the year.  

## Judges 12

1.  Jephthah Wars with Ephraim And [4gathered together 1the 2sons 3of Ephraim], and they came to Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, Why is it that you went to wage war against the sons of Ammon, and [3us 1you did not 2call] to go with you?  [2your house 1We will burn] over you with fire.

2. And Jephthah said to them, [2a man 3pleading 1I was], and  my people, and the sons of Ammon humbled me exceedingly, and I yelled out to you, and you did not deliver me from out of their hand.

3. And I saw that there was no  one delivering, and I put  my life in  my hand, and I passed over to the sons of Ammon, and [2delivered them over 1the lord] into my hand. And why did you ascend against me in  this day to wage war against me?

4. And Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and waged war against Ephraim. And [3struck 1the men 2of Gilead]  Ephraim; for [4said 1the 2men coming through safe  3of Ephraim], You are Gilead in the midst  of Ephraim, and in the midst  of Manasseh.

5. And Gilead was first to take the ford of the Jordan  of Ephraim. And it came to pass when [4said 5to them 1the 2ones coming through safe  3of Ephraim], We should pass over indeed! That [4said 5to them 1the 2men 3of Gilead], [2not 3of  4Ephraim 1Are you]? And they said, We are not.

6. Then they said to them, Say indeed, Stachys! And if he was not straightly able  to speak thus, then they would take hold of them, and slay them at the ford of the Jordan. And they that fell from Ephraim in  that time were forty and two thousand.

7. And Jephthah judged  Israel six years. Then [4died 1Jephthah 2the 3Gileadite], and he was entombed in his city Gilead. 

8.  Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon Judge Israel And [4judged 6after 7him  5Israel 1Ibzan 2of 3Beth-lehem].

9. And there were to him thirty sons, and thirty daughters  being sent out, and [2thirty 3wives 1he brought in]  for his sons from outside. And he judged  Israel seven years.

10. And Ibzan died, and he was entombed in Beth-lehem.

11. And [4judged 6after 7him  5Israel 1Elon 2the 3Zebulunite], and he judged  Israel ten years.

12. And [4died 1Elon 2the 3Zebulunite], and was entombed in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.

13. And [6judged 8after 9him  7Israel 1Abdon 2son 3of Hillel 4the 5Pirathonite].

14. And there were to him forty sons, and thirty sons  of his sons being mounted upon seventy foals. And he judged  Israel eight years.

15. And [6died 1Abdon 2the son 3of Hillel 4the 5Pirathonite], and he was entombed in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountain of Amalek.  

## Judges 13

1.  The Angel Appears to Manoah and His Wife And [4proceeded 5still 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to act  wickedly before the lord, and [2delivered 3them 1the lord] into the hand of the Philistines -- forty years.

2. And there was [2man 1one] from Zorah, from the tribe  of Dan, and the name to him was Manoah, and  his wife was sterile, and had not given birth.

3. And [3appeared 1an angel 2of the lord] to the woman, and he said to her, Behold indeed, you are sterile, and have not borne; but [2in 3the womb 1you shall have one], and shall bear a son.

4. And now guard and do not drink wine and liquor, and do not eat any unclean thing!

5. For behold, you [2in 3the womb 1have one], and you shall bear a son, and an iron razor shall not ascend upon  his head, for [4a Nazarite  5to God 3will be 1the 2boy] from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver  Israel from out of the hand of the Philistines.

6. And [3went in 1the 2woman] and said  to her husband, saying, A man  of God came to me, and  his appearance was as the appearance of an angel  of God -- [2prominent 1very]. And I did not ask him from what place he is, and  his name he did not report to me.

7. And he said to me, Behold, you [2in 3the womb 1have one], and you shall give birth to a son. And now do not drink wine and strong drink, and do not eat any uncleanness! for [4a Nazarite 5of God 3will be 1the 2boy] from the womb until the day of his death.

8. And Manoah besought of the lord. And he said, Be to me, O lord, the man  of God whom you sent, let him come yet once more to us and enlighten us! what we should do with the boy to be born.

9. And God heeded the voice of Manoah; and [4came 1the 2angel  3of God] again to the woman. And she sat in the field, and Manoah  her husband was not with her.

10. And [3hastened 1the 2woman], and ran, and reported  to her husband, and she said to him, Behold, [3has appeared 4to me 1the 2man], the one coming  in this day to me.

11. And [2rose up 3and 4went 1Manoah] after  his wife. And he came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man  speaking to the woman? And [3said 1the 2angel], I am.

12. And Manoah said, Now, [2going through  1your word], what will be  the distinguishing manner of the boy, and  his works?

13. And [4said 1the 2angel 3of the lord] to Manoah, Of all which I spoke to the woman, let her guard!

14. From every thing which goes forth from out of the grapevine, she shall not eat, and wine and liquor she shall not drink, and every thing unclean she shall not eat; all as much as I gave charge to her, let her guard!

15. And Manoah said to the angel of the lord, We should indeed force you to stay, and shall prepare before you a kid of the goats.

16. And [4said 1the 2angel 3of the lord] to Manoah, If it should hold me I will not eat from  your bread loaves. And if you should offer a whole burnt-offering, [3to the 4 lord 1you shall offer 2it]. For [2did not 3know 1Manoah] that [2an angel 3of the lord 1he was].

17. And Manoah said to the angel of the lord, What is the name to you, that whenever [2should come to pass  1your word] that we should glorify you?

18. And [4said 5to him 1the 2angel 3of the lord], Why is this you ask  of my name, for it is Wonderful?

19. And Manoah took the kid of the goats, and the sacrifice offering, and he offered it upon the rock to the lord, to the wonderful thing being done; and Manoah and  his wife were viewing. 

20.  The Angel Ascends in a Flame And it happened in the [2ascending  1flame] on top of the altar unto the heaven, that [4ascended 1the 2angel 3of the lord] in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and  his wife were viewing, and they fell upon their face upon the ground.

21. And [4did not 5proceed 6any longer 1the 2angel 3of the lord] to appear to Manoah and to  his wife. Then Manoah knew that [2an angel 3of the lord 1this was].

22. And Manoah said to  his wife, To death we shall die, for we have looked at God.

23. And [2said 3to him  1his wife], If [2wanted 1the lord] to kill us, he would not have received from  our hand a whole burnt-offering and a sacrifice offering, and he would not have enlightened us all these things, even as this time, and he would not [3audible 1have made 4to us 2these things]. 

24.  The Birth of Samson And [3bore 1the 2woman] a son, and she called  his name Samson. And [3grew 1the 2boy], and [2blessed 3him 1the lord].

25. And [3began 1spirit 2of the lord] to go forth with him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and between Eshtaol.  

## Judges 14

1.  Samson Takes a Wife from the Philistines And Samson went down unto Timnath, and he saw a woman in Timnath from the daughters of the Philistines.

2. And he ascended, and reported to his father and to his mother. And he said, [2a woman 1I have seen] in Timnath from the daughters of the Philistines. And now take her to me for wife!

3. And [2said 3to him  1his father], and  his mother, Is it that there is not [2of 3the 4daughters  5of your brethren 6and 7among 8all  9my people 1a woman], that you should go to take a wife from the [2Philistines  1uncircumcised]? And Samson said to  his father, Take this one for me! for she pleases in my eyes.

4. And  his father and  his mother did not know that [2from 3the lord 1it is], that [3recompense 1he 2required] of the Philistines. And in  that time the Philistines dominated the sons of Israel.

5. And Samson went down, and  his father and  his mother unto Timnath. And he came to the vineyards of Timnath. And behold, a cub of a lion was roaring in meeting him.

6. And [3straightened 4upon 5him 1spirit 2of the lord], and he tore it apart as a kid of the goats, and nothing was in  his hand. And he did not report to his father and to his mother what he did.

7. And they went down and spoke to the woman, and she was pleasing before Samson.

8. And he returned after some days to take her, and he turned aside to behold the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm as of an apiary of bees was in the mouth of the lion, and honey.

9. And he took of it into  his mouth, and went forth going and eating. And he went to  his father and to  his mother, and he gave to them, and they ate, and he did not announce to them that [4from 5the 6manner 7of the 8lion 1he took 2the 3honey].

10. And [2went down  1his father] to the woman, and [2prepared 3there 1Samson] a banquet for seven days; for thus [3did 1the 2young men].

11. And it came to pass in  their fearing him, that they posted in front to him thirty companions, and they were with him. 

12.  Samson's Riddle And [2said 3to them 1Samson], I will propound indeed to you  a riddle, and if by reporting you should report it to me in the seven days of the banquet, and you should find the solution, I will give to you thirty pieces of fine linen, and thirty robes of clothes.

13. And if you should not be able to report the solution to me, then you shall give to me yourselves thirty pieces of fine linen, and thirty robes of clothes. And they said to him, Propound  your riddle, and we shall hear it!

14. And he said to them, From the one eating came forth food, and from the strong came forth sweetness. And they were not able to explain the riddle for three days.

15. And it came to pass in the [2day  1seventh], and they spoke to the wife of Samson, saying, Deceive indeed  your husband! and let him explain to you the riddle, lest at any time we should burn you and the house  of your father by fire; or [3to make us poor 1did you call 2us]?

16. And [4wept 1the 2wife 3of Samson] to him, and said to him, You detest me, and do not love me, because the riddle which you propounded to the sons  of my people, you did not explain even it to me. And [2said 3to her 1Samson], Behold, to my father and to my mother I did not report it, and should I report to you?

17. And she wept upon him for the seven days in which [3was 4to them 1the 2banquet]. And it came to pass on the [2day  1seventh] he explained to her, for she troubled him. And she reported to the sons  of her people.

18. And [5said 6to him 1the 2men 3of the 4city] on the [2day  1seventh] before [3going down 1the 2sun], What is sweeter than honey, and what is stronger than a lion? And [2said 3to them 1Samson], Unless you plowed by  my heifer, you would not have found  my riddle.

19. And [3straightened 4upon 5him 1spirit 2of the lord], and he went down unto Ashkelon, and smote from there thirty men, and took  their robes, and gave them to the ones explaining the riddle. And [2was enraged 3in anger 1Samson], and he ascended into the house  of his father.

20. And [4lived with 1the 2wife 3of Samson]  his groomsman who was his companion.  

## Judges 15

1.  Samson is Denied His Wife And it came to pass after some days, at the days [2harvest 1of the wheat], that Samson visited  his wife, carrying a kid of the goats. And he said, I shall enter to  my wife into the bedroom. But [2would not 3grant 4him  1her father] to enter.

2. And [2said  1her father], In saying, I said that, By detesting you detested her; and I gave her to your companion. [3not 1Behold  6sister 4her  5younger 7better 8than she 2is]? Let her be to you instead of her! 

3.  Samson Burns the Fields of the Philistines And [2said 3to him 1Samson], I am innocent this once concerning the Philistines, that I myself should do [2with 3you 1evils].

4. And Samson went and seized three hundred foxes, and took lamps, and tied together tail to tail, and put [2lamp 1one] between the two tails, and guided them.

5. And he kindled fire in the lamps, and he sent them out in the ears of corn of the Philistines. And he burned the ears of corn from the threshing-floor, and unto [2ears of corn 1the straight standing], and unto the vineyard, and olive orchards.

6. And [3said 1the 2Philistines], Who did these things? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took  his wife, and he gave her to his male companion. And [3ascended up 1the 2Philistines] and burnt her and the house  of her father by fire.

7. And [2said 3to them 1Samson], Since you should do thus, I shall not think well, but  [2my vengeance 3against 5one 4each 6of you 1I will execute].

8. And he struck them leg on thigh [2beating 1with a great]. And he went down and sat at the hole in the rock of Etam.

9. And [3ascended 1the 2Philistines] and camped in Judah, and cast forth about Lehi.

10. And [4said 5to them 1every 2man 3of Judah], Why have you ascended against us? And [3said 1the 2Philistines], [2to tie up  3Samson 1We ascended], and to do to him in which manner he did to us.

11. And [5went down 1three thousand 2men 3of 4Judah] unto the hole in the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Do you not behold that [3dominate 1the 2Philistines] us? Then why [2these things 1did you do] to us? And [2said 3to them 1Samson], In which manner they did to me, so I did to them.

12. And they said to him, [2to tie 3you 1We came down],  to deliver you up into the hands of the Philistines. And [2said 3to them 1Samson], Swear to me by an oath to not kill me yourselves, that lest at any time you should meet up with me yourselves.

13. And they swore by an oath to him, saying, No, but only by a bond will we tie you, for we should deliver you up into their hands; but to death we will not kill you. And they tied him with two [2ropes 1new], and bore him from the rock.

14. And he came unto Jaw, and the Philistines shouted and ran to meet him. And [3straightened 4upon 5him 1spirit 2of the lord], and [5became 1the 2ropes  3in  4his arms] as hemp when  [2smells 1fire], and [3melted away 1the 2bonds] from  his arms. 

15.  Samson Strikes with the Jawbone of a Donkey And he found a jaw bone of a donkey having been tossed. And he stretched out  his hand, and took it, and struck with it a thousand men.

16. And Samson said, By the jaw bone of a donkey, in wiping away, I wiped them away, for by the jaw bone of the donkey I struck a thousand men.

17. And it came to pass when he finished speaking, that he tossed the jaw bone from  his hand, and he called  that place, Removal of the Jaw.

18. And he thirsted exceedingly, and he yelled to the lord, and said, You gave by the hand  of your servant  [3deliverance  2great 1this], and now shall I die in thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?

19. And God opened the gash, the one in  Jaw, and there came forth from out of it waters, and he drank, and [2was restored  1his spirit], and he lived. Because of this [2is called  1its name], Spring of the Calling Upon, which is in Jaw until  this day.

20. And he judged  Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.  

## Judges 16

1.  Samson Carries Away the Gates of the City And Samson went into Gaza, and saw there a woman harlot, and he entered to her.

2. And it was reported to the Gazites, saying, Samson comes here. And they encircled, and laid in wait for him the entire night at the gate of the city. And they were silent the entire  night, saying, [2until 3light shows through  4at dawn 1We should wait], and we should kill him.

3. And Samson went to bed until midnight. And he rose up at half the night, and he took hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two doorposts, and carried them with the bar, and put them upon his shoulders, and bore them upon the top of the mountain which is at the face of Hebron. 

4.  Samson and Delilah And it came to pass after this, that he loved a woman by the rushing stream Sorek, and her name was Delilah.

5. And [5ascended 6to 7her 1the 2satraps 3of the 4Philistines], and said to her, Beguile him, and see by what means  [3strength 1his 4is  2great], and by what means we shall be able to prevail against him, and tie him so as to humble him. And we will give to you by man a thousand and a hundred pieces of silver.

6. And Delilah said to Samson, Explain indeed to me by what means  [3strength is 1your  2great]! and by what means you shall be tied so as to humble you?

7. And [2said 3to 4her 1Samson], If they should tie me with seven [2strings of a bow 1wet] that are not ruined, then I will be weakened, and I will be as one of the men.

8. And [5brought 6to her 1the 2satraps 3of the 4Philistines] seven [2strings of a bow 1wet] not ruined. And she tied him with them.

9. And the ambush sat down for him in the storeroom. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson. And he tore up the strings of the bow in which manner one pulls apart yarn of hemp in  its smelling of fire, and [2was not 3made known  1his strength].

10. And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you misled me, and you spoke to me by lying. Now then report to me!  how you shall be tied.

11. And he said to her, If by binding, they should tie me by [2ropes 1new] which were not used in  work, then I shall be weak, and I will be as one of the men.

12. And Delilah took [2ropes 1new], and tied him with them. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson. And the ambush sat in the storeroom. And he pulled them from  his arms as thread.

13. And Delilah said to Samson, Until now you misled me, and spoke to me lying. Announce indeed to me! by what means you shall be tied. And he said to her, If you should weave the seven strands of hair  of my head with the warp, and hammer with the peg into the wall, then I will be weak as one of the men.

14. And it came to pass in  his going to sleep, that Delilah took the seven strands  of his head, and weaved them with the warp, and pinned them to the peg into the wall. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson. And he was awakened from  his sleep, and he pulled out the pegs in the woven work from out of the wall, and the warp; for he did not know  his strength.

15. And [2said 3to 4him 1Delilah], How do you say, I love you, and  your heart is not with me? This third time you misled me, and did not report to me by what means  [3strength is 1your  2great].

16. And it came to pass when she worked him by  her words the whole  night, and troubled him, so that he was faint-hearted unto  death.

17. And he reported to her all the things from his heart. And said to her, A razor shall not ascend upon  my head, for [3a Nazarite 4of God 1I 2am] from the belly of my mother; and if I should be shaven, [2shall leave 3from 4me  1my strength], and I shall be weakened, and I will be as all the men.

18. And Delilah knew that he reported to her all  his heart. And she sent and called the satraps of the Philistines, saying, Ascend  this once! for he reported to me all  his heart. And ascended up to her all the satraps of the Philistines, and they brought the silver into  her hands.

19. And she rested him between  her knees. And she called the barber, and he shaved the seven curls  of his head; and it began to humble him, and [2left  1his strength] from him. 

20.  Samson Is Taken Captive and Blinded And Delilah said, The Philistines are upon you, Samson. And he was awakened from out of  his sleep. And he said, I shall go forth, and I shall do as continually before, and I shall brush myself off. And he did not know that the lord left from him.

21. And [3took hold of 4him 1the 2Philistines], and gouged out  his eyes, and carried him unto Gaza. And they bound him with shackles of brass, and he was grinding in the house of the prison.

22. And [3began  1the hair  2of his head] to grow, as he was shaven.

23. And the rulers of the Philistines came together  to sacrifice [2sacrifice 1a great] to Dagon  their god, and  to be merry. And they said, [2delivered  1Our god] into our hand Samson  our enemy.

24. And [3saw 4him 1the 2people], and they praised  their god, for they said, [2delivered  1Our god]  our enemy into our hands, the one making [2quite desolate  1our land], who multiplied  our slain.

25. And it came to pass when [2was feeling good  1their heart], that they said, Call  Samson from out of the house of the prison, and let him play before us! And they called  Samson from out of the house of the jail, and they sported with him. And they stood him in between the two posts.

26. And Samson said to the young man  leading him by the hand, Allow me! for I should handle the monumental pillars upon of which the house stays upon them.

27. And the house was full of the men and women, and [6were there 1all 2the 3satraps 4of the 5Philistines]. And upon the roof were about three thousand men and women, looking at and mocking  Samson.

28. And Samson yelled to the lord, and said, O lord, O lord, remember me, and strengthen me indeed besides! even  this once O God, and I will avenge [2vengeance 1one] against  [4two 5eyes 3for my 1the 2Philistines].

29. And Samson took hold of the two posts in the midst upon which the house stood, and he stayed against them, one at  his right hand, and one at  at his left. 

30.  Samson Pulls Down the House of the Philistines And Samson said, Let [2die  1my soul] with the Philistines. And he leaned in strength, and [3fell 1the 2house] upon the satraps, and upon all the people  in it. And [6were 1the ones 2having died 3whom 5put to death 4Samson] in  his death many over whom he put to death in  his life.

31. And [2went down  1his brothers], and all the house  of his father, and they took him, and they ascended and entombed him between Zorah and between Esthaol in the burying-place of Manoah  his father. And he judged  Israel twenty years.  

## Judges 17

1.  Micah Makes a Molten Image And there was a man of mount Ephraim, and his name was Micah.

2. And he said to his mother, The thousand and hundred pieces of silver  seized from you, and you adjured and said it in  my ears -- behold, the silver is with me, I took it. And [2said  1his mother], Being blessed is  my son in the lord.

3. And he gave back the thousand and hundred  pieces of silver to his mother. And [2said  1his mother], By sanctification, I sanctified the silver to the lord out of  my hand alone,  to make a carving and molten image, and now I will give it back to you.

4. And he gave back the silver to his mother. Then [2took  1his mother] two hundred of the pieces of silver, and gave them to the smelterer. And he made it into a carving and molten image. And it was in the house of Micah.

5. And the house of Micah was to him the house of God. And he made an ephod and teraphim. And he filled up the hand of one  of his sons, and he became to him for a priest.

6. In  those days there was not a king in Israel; a man  [2upright 3in 4his own eyes 1did]. 

7.  A Levite Becomes Micah's Priest And there was a young man from out of Beth-lehem Judah from the kin of Judah, and he was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

8. And [3went 1the 2man] from the city of Beth-lehem Judah to sojourn where ever he should find. And he came unto mount Ephraim, and unto the house of Micah,  making his way.

9. And [2said 3to him 1Micah], From what place come you? And he said to him, [3a Levite 1I 2am] from Beth-lehem Judah, and I go to sojourn where ever I should find.

10. And [2said 3to him 1Micah], Sit down with me, and become to me as a father and as priest, and I will give to you ten silver pieces for days, and a pair of clothes, and the things for your means of life.

11. And [3went 1the 2Levite], and he began to sojourn by the man. And [3became 1the 2young man] to him as one of his sons.

12. And Micah filled up the hand of the Levite, and [3became 4to him 1the 2young man] for a priest, and he was in the house of Micah.

13. And Micah said, Now I know that [2did good 3to me 1the lord], for [3became 4to me 1the 2Levite] for a priest.  

## Judges 18

1.  Dan Seeks an Inheritance In  those days there was not a king in Israel. And in  those days the tribe of Dan sought for itself an inheritance  to dwell, for [2did not 3fall in 4to it 5until  6that day 7in 8the midst 9of the tribes 10of Israel 1an inheritance].

2. And [4sent out 1the 2sons 3of Dan] from their peoples five men from their part, men of sons of power, from Zorah and Esthaol,  to survey the land, and to track it. And they said to them, Go, and search out the land! And they came unto mount Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and they rested there.

3. In their being by the house of Micah, that they knew the voice of the young man, the Levite, and they turned aside there. And they said to him, Who brought you here? And what do you do here? And what is it here?

4. And he said to them, [3so 4and 5so 2did 6with me 1Micah], and hired me, and I became to him for a priest.

5. And they said to him, Ask indeed to  God! that we will know if [2greatly prospers  1our way] which we go by it.

6. And [3said 4to them 1the 2priest], Go in peace before the lord!  your way by which you go by it.

7. And [4went 1the 2five 3men] and came into Laish. And they saw the people  in it dwelling in hope as the amalgamation of the Sidonians, being tranquil in hope, and not being able to speak a word in the land, for they are far from Sidon, and [2word 1there was no] to them with Syria.

8. And [4came 1the 2five 3men] to  their brethren in Zorah and in Esthaol. And [2said 3to them  1their brethren], Why do you sit down?

9. And they said, Rise up, for we should ascend against them! for we saw the land, and behold, [2good, 1it is exceedingly]. And you are silent? You should not be reluctant  to go and to enter  to inherit the land.

10. When ever you should enter, you shall come to a people being secure, and the land of broad space, for [2delivered it over  1God] into your hand. A place where there is not [2there 1any deficiency] of a thing as much as is on the earth.

11. And they departed from there, from the kin  of Dan, from Zorah and from Esthaol -- six hundred men being girded with weapons for battle.

12. And they ascended and camped in Kirjath-jearim in Judah. On account of this [2was called  1that place], Camp of Dan until  this day. Behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.

13. And they went from there unto  mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. 

14.  Micah's Idols Stolen And [9responded 1the 2five 3men  4going 5to survey 6the 7land 8of Laish]. And they said to  their brethren, Did you know that there is in  these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a carved image, and a molten image? And now know what you shall do!

15. And they turned aside there, and entered into the house of the young man -- the Levite, into the house of Micah, and they asked him for peace.

16. And the six hundred men being girded with weapons for their warfare, being set up by the door of the gatehouse, were the ones from the sons of Dan.

17. Then [8ascended 1the 2five 3men  4going 5to survey 6the 7land]; and coming there, they took the carved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. And the priest was set up by the door of the gatehouse, and the six hundred men  were girded with weapons for warfare.

18. And when these entered into the house of Micah, and took the carved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, that [3said 4to 5them 1the 2priest], What do you do?

19. And they said to him, Be silent, place  your hand over  your mouth, and come with us! and you will be to us for a father and for a priest. Is it not better for you to be a priest of the house [2man 1of one], or for you to be priest of a tribe and kin in Israel?

20. And it was good to the heart of the priest. And he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the carved image, and the molten image, and entered into the midst of the people.

21. And they turned and went forth, and put the children, and the property, and the load before them.

22. And they were far from the house of Micah, and behold, Micah and the men  in the houses,  near the house of Micah cried out, and they overtook the sons of Dan.

23. And they yelled to the sons of Dan. And [4turned 1the 2sons 3of Dan]  their faces, and they said to Micah, What is it to you that you cry out?

24. And he said, The gods which I made you took, and the priest, and you departed. And what is there to me still? And what is this you say to me, Why is this that you cry out?

25. And [4said 5to 6him 1the 2sons 3of Dan], [2should not 3be heard  1Your voice] with us, lest at any time [4should confront 5you 1men 2in severe pain 3of soul], and you shall add  your life, and the life  of your household.

26. And [4went 1the 2sons 3of Dan] on  their way. And Micah saw that [2too mighty 3for him 1they are], and he turned aside and returned to  his house. 

27.  The Sons of Dan Destroy Laish And they took as much as Micah made, and the priest who was with him, and they went unto Laish, upon a people being tranquil, and being secure. And they struck them by the mouth of the broadsword, and the city they burned by fire.

28. And there is no  one rescuing, for it is far from Sidon, and communication is not to them with man; and it is in the valley which is of the house of Rehob. And they built up the city, and dwelt in it.

29. And they called the name of the city Dan, according to the name of Dan  their father, who was born  to Israel. And [5was 6Laish 1the name 2to the 3city  4formerly].

30. And [4set up 5for themselves 1the 2sons 3of Dan] the carved image. And Jonathan, son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and  his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the displacement of the land.

31. And they themselves stationed the carved image Micah made all the days, as many as [4was 1the 2house  3of God] in Shiloh. And it came to pass in  those days there was no king in Israel.  

## Judges 19

1.  A Levite and His Concubine And there was a man, a Levite, sojourning on the sides of mount Ephraim. And he took to himself a woman concubine from Beth-lehem Judah.

2. And [2provoked him to anger  1his concubine], and she went forth from him unto the house  of her father in Beth-lehem Judah, and she was there the days of four months.

3. And [2rose up  1her husband] and went after her,  to speak unto  her heart,  to reconcile her; and  his servant was with him, and a pair of beasts of burden. And he went unto the house of her father. And [5beheld 6him 1the 2father 3of the 4young woman], and was at hand for meeting him.

4. And [2brought him in  1his father-in-law], the father of the young woman, and he stayed with him three days. And they ate and drank and slept there.

5. And it came to pass on the [2day  1fourth], that they rose early in the morning, and he rose up  to depart. And [5said 1the 2father 3of the 4young woman] to  his son-in-law, Support  your heart with a piece of bread, and after this go!

6. And he sat down, and [2ate 1both] together, and drank. And [5said 1the 2father 3of the 4young woman] to the man, For a beginning, lodge and do good to your heart!

7. And [3rose up 1the 2man] to depart. And [2forced 3him  1his father-in-law], and he stayed and lodged there.

8. And he rose early in the morning on the [2day  1fifth]  to depart. And [5said 1the 2father 3of the 4young woman], Support indeed  your heart with bread, and soldier until [3should decline 1the 2day]! And [2ate 3and 4drank 1both].

9. And [3rose up 1the 2man]  to go, he and  his concubine, and  his servant. And [2said 3to him  1his father-in-law], the father of the young woman, Behold, indeed [2is declined  1the day] into evening, lodge here and do good to your heart, and rise early tomorrow unto  your way, and you shall depart unto  your tent!

10. And [3did not want 1the 2man] to lodge. And he rose up and went forth and came unto before Jebus, this is Jerusalem, and with him were a pair of beasts of burden being saddled, and  his concubine with him.

11. And they were near Jebus, and the day declined exceedingly. And [3said 1the 2servant] to  his master, Come please, even we should turn aside into  [2city 3of the 4Jebusites 1this], and lodge in it.

12. And [2said 3to 4him  1his master], In no way shall we turn aside into [2city 1an alien], in which there is no one from the sons of Israel; even we shall go by unto Gibeah.

13. And he said to his servant, Come, for we should approach one of the places, and we should lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah.

14. And they went by, and [3went down 4on them 1the 2sun] being next  to Gibeah, which is  of Benjamin. 

15.  The Evil in Gibeah And they turned aside there  to enter to rest up in Gibeah. And he entered and sat in the square of the city, and there is no man  bringing them into the house  to rest up.

16. And behold, [2man 1an old] entered from  his works from out of the field at evening, and the man was from mount Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; and the men of the place were sons of Benjamin.

17. And he looked up  with his eyes, and he saw the man, the one journeying in the square of the city. And [4said  3man 1the 2old], Where are you going, and from what place come you?

18. And he said to him, We are passing over from Beth-lehem of Judah unto the side of mount Ephraim. [4from there 1And 2I 3am], and I went unto Beth-lehem of Judah, and [3to  4my house 1I 2run]; but there is no man bringing me into  a house.

19. And indeed straw and fodder exists for our donkeys, and indeed bread and wine exists to me, and to the maidservant, and to the servant; and to your servants there is no deficiency of any thing.

20. And [4said 1the 3man  2old], Peace to you; only let any  deficiency of yours be upon me, only [3in 4the 5square 1you should not 2rest up].

21. And he brought him into  his house, and camped  his beasts of burden. And they washed  their feet, and they ate and drank.

22. And they were doing [2good  1their heart]; and behold, the men of the city, sons of lawbreakers, encircled the house, and knocked upon the door; and they said to the man, the master of the house, the old man, saying, Lead out the man  entering into  your house, that we should know him.

23. And [3came forth 4to 5them 1the 2man], the master of the house, and he said to them, By no means, my brethren, you should not do evil indeed with  [2entering  1this man] into  my house; you should not do  this folly.

24. Behold, my daughter the virgin, and  his concubine; and I will bring them, and you humble them, and do to them the good thing in your eyes, but  to this man you should not do the thing  of this folly.

25. And [3did not 4want 1the 2men] to hear him. And [3took hold 1the 2man]  of his concubine, and led her to them outside. And they knew her, and sported with her the entire  night until the morning. And they sent her at the same time the [2ascended  1dawn]. 

26.  The Levite's Concubine Perishes And [3came 1the 2woman] in the morning, and fell by the door of the vestibule of the house of the man of whom [2was  1her master] there, until of which time light shown through.

27. And [2rose up  1her master] in the morning, and he opened the doors of the house, and he came forth  to depart into  his way. And behold, the woman,  his concubine, was fallen by the door of the house, and  her hands were upon the threshold.

28. And he said to her, Rise up, for we should go forth! And she did not answer to him for she had died. And he lifted her upon the beast of burden, and [3rose up 1the 2man] and went forth to  his place.

29. And he entered into  his house, and he took the knife, and took hold of  his concubine, and dismembered her according to  her bones into twelve portions, and he sent them unto all the tribes of Israel.

30. And it came to pass all the ones seeing said, Neither happened, nor was thus seen from the days of the ascending of the sons of Israel from out of the land of Egypt until  this day. Appoint indeed to yourselves [2concerning 3her 1counsel] and speak!  

## Judges 20

1.  Israel Confronts Benjamin And there came forth all the sons of Israel, and [3held an assembly 1the 2congregation] as [2man 1one], from Dan and unto Beer-sheba, and the land of Gilead, before the lord in Mizpeh.

2. And [3established 1the 2region] all of the people in all the tribes  of Israel in the assembly of the people  of God -- four hundred thousand men on foot unsheathing the broadsword.

3. And [4heard 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin] that [4ascended 1the 2sons 3of Israel] unto Mizpeh. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Israel], Tell where [3took place  2evil 1this]?

4. And [3answered 1the 2man], the Levite, the husband of the woman  having been murdered. And he said, [2unto 3Gibeah  4of Benjamin 1I came], I and  my concubine  to rest up.

5. And [3rose up 4against 5me 1the 2men], the ones  of Gibeah, and they encircled upon me, upon the house at night; and [3me 1they wanted 2to kill], and  [2my concubine 1they humbled], and sported with her, and she died.

6. And I took hold  of my concubine, and I dismembered her, and I sent out into every border of the inheritance of Israel; for they committed folly in Israel.

7. Behold, all you, the sons of Israel, make to yourselves an account and plan here!

8. And [4rose up 1all 2the 3people] as [2man 1one], saying, We shall not enter -- a man into  his tent, and we shall not turn aside -- a man to  his house.

9. And now [2the 3thing 1this is] which we shall do  to Gibeah; we will ascend against it by lot.

10. And we shall take ten men out of a hundred for all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand men, and a thousand out of ten thousand men, to take a provision for the people, to complete the task to the ones in going unto  Gibeah  of Benjamin, against all the folly which they did in Israel.

11. And came together every man of Israel to the city as [2man 1one] coming.

12. And [4sent out 1the 2tribes 3of Israel] men in all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What is this evil that took place among you?

13. And now, give over the [2men  1impious]  in Gibeah, the sons of Belial, and we shall kill them and lift away evil from Israel. But [4did not 5want 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin] to hear the voice  of their brethren of the sons of Israel.

14. And [4came together 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin] from  their cities to Gibeah, to go forth into battle array against the sons of Israel.

15. And [4numbered 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin] in  that day of the cities, twenty  five thousand men unsheathing the broadsword, apart from the ones dwelling  in Gibeah.

16. These numbered seven hundred [2men 1chosen] from all of the people, ambidextrous; all these were slingers casting stones accurate to the hair, and not missing.

17. And every man of Israel -- they were numbered, separate from the sons  of Benjamin, four hundred thousand men unsheathing the broadsword; all these were men warriors.

18. And they rose up and ascended unto Beth-el, and asked of  God. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Israel], Who shall ascend to us guiding to wage war with the sons of Benjamin? And the lord said, Judah shall ascend guiding. 

19.  Israel Wars against Benjamin And [4rose up 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in the morning, and camped at Gibeah.

20. And [4went forth 1every 2man 3of Israel] for war against Benjamin; and he deployed against them -- the man of Israel for war against  Gibeah.

21. And came forth the sons of Benjamin from the city, and utterly destroyed in Israel on  that day two and twenty thousand men upon the ground.

22. And [3strengthened 1the 2people] -- the man of Israel, and proceeded to deploy for war in the place in which he deployed there on the [2day  1first].

23. And [4ascended up 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and they wept before the lord until evening, and they asked of the lord, saying, Shall I proceed to draw near for war against the sons of Benjamin  my brother? And the lord said, Ascend against him!

24. And [4came forward 1the 2sons 3of Israel] against the sons of Benjamin in the [2day  1second].

25. And Benjamin came forth to meet them from  Gibeah on the [2day  1second]. And they utterly destroyed yet of the people of Israel eighteen thousand men upon the ground, all these unsheathing the broadsword.

26. And [5ascended up 1all 2the 3sons 4of Israel], and all the people, and they came unto Beth-el and wept, and sat there before the lord, and fasted in  that day until evening; and they offered a whole burnt-offering for deliverance before the lord.

27. And [4asked 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in the lord. And [4was there  1the ark 2of the covenant 3of the lord] in  those days.

28. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron stood before it in  those days, saying, Shall I proceed still to go forth for war against the sons of Benjamin  my brother, or slacken? And the lord said, Ascend, and tomorrow I will deliver him into  your hand. 

29.  Ambush at Gibeah And [4placed 1the 2sons 3of Israel] an ambush in  Gibeah round about.

30. And [4ascended 1the 2sons 3of Israel] against the sons of Benjamin on the [2day  1third]. And they deployed against  Gibeah as once before, and once before that.

31. And [4came forth 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin] for meeting the people, and were drawn away from the city. And they began to strike of the people (slain as once before, and once before that) in the ways which there is one ascending to Beth-el, and one ascending to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of  Israel.

32. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin], They stumble before us as before. And the sons of Israel said, We should flee and pull them out from the city into the ways.

33. And every man of Israel rose up from  his place, and deployed in Baal-tamar. And the ambush of Israel wrestled from out of  its place from the descent  of Gibeah.

34. And they arrived right opposite Gibeah -- ten thousand [2men 1chosen] from out of all Israel. And the battle weighed down, and they did not know that [2has been affixed 3upon 4them  1hurt].

35. And [2put 4to flight 1the lord  3Benjamin] before Israel. And [4utterly destroyed 1the 2sons 3of Israel] among  Benjamin in  that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men, all these unsheathing the broadsword.

36. And [4beheld 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin] that they were put to flight. And [3gave 1the man 2of Israel]  place to Benjamin, for they hoped upon the ambush which they arranged near  Gibeah. 

37.  Gibeah is Destroyed And the ambush advanced, and they poured out against  Gibeah. And [3went 1the 2ambush], and they struck all the city by the mouth of the broadsword.

38. And the arranged order was with the man of Israel with the ambush,  for them to offer a signal-fire  of smoke from the city.

39. And [3turned 1the man 2of Israel] in the battle. And Benjamin began  to strike slain against the man of Israel about thirty men. For they said, Surely being put to flight he was put to flight before us as the battle  before.

40. And the signal-fire began to ascend from the city as a column of smoke. And Benjamin looked behind him, and behold, there ascended the consummation of the city unto the heaven.

41. And the man of Israel turned. And [3hastened 1the man 2of Benjamin], for he beheld that [2has touched 3him  1a bad thing].

42. And they leaned before the man of Israel in the way of the wilderness, and the battle fell [3unawares 1upon 2them]; and the ones from the cities -- they utterly destroyed them in their midst.

43. And they cut up  Benjamin, and pursued him according to his feet, and trampled him unto before Gibeah towards the rising of the sun.

44. And [6fell 4of  5Benjamin 1eighteen 2thousand 3men];  all these men of power.

45. And they turned aside and fled into the wilderness to the rock  of Rimmon. And they gleaned him in the ways -- five thousand men. And they cleaved after them unto Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.

46. And it came to pass all the ones falling among  Benjamin was twenty-five thousand men unsheathing the broadsword in  that day;  all these were men of power.

47. And they turned aside and fled into the wilderness to the rock  of Rimmon -- six hundred men; and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon four months.

48. And the man of Israel turned against the sons of Benjamin, and they struck them by the mouth of the broadsword, from [2city 1the next], unto beast, and unto all  being found in the cities; and the cities  being found they burned by fire.  

## Judges 21

1.  Wives for the Tribe of Benjamin And the man of Israel swore by an oath in Mizpeh, saying, [2man 3from 4us 1No] shall give his daughter  to Benjamin for a wife.

2. And [4came 1all 2the 3people] unto Beth-el, and sat there until evening before  God. And they lifted  their voice and wept [2weeping 1a great].

3. And they said, Why, O lord God of Israel, was this taken place in  Israel,  to overlook today in  Israel [2tribe 1one]?

4. And it happened the next day that [3rose early 1the 2people], and they built there an altar, and offered a whole burnt-offering of deliverance.

5. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Israel], Who is the one not ascending among the assembly from all of the tribes of Israel to the lord? For  [3oath 2a great 1there was] concerning the one not ascending to the lord in Mizpeh, saying, To death he shall die.

6. And [4relented 1the 2sons 3of Israel] concerning [2Benjamin  1their brother], and said, [5is removed 6today 2tribe 1one 3from 4Israel].

7. What should we do to them, to the ones left behind for wives, for we swore by an oath to the lord  to not give to them from  our daughters for wives?

8. And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel which did not ascend to the lord in Mizpeh? And behold, no [2came 1man] to the camp from Jabish Gilead to the assembly.

9. And [3were numbered 1the 2people], And behold, there is not there a man from the ones dwelling in Jabish Gilead. 

10.  Jabish Gilead is Struck by the Sword And [3sent 4there 1the 2congregation] twelve thousand men from the sons of the force. And they gave charge to them, saying, Go and strike all the ones dwelling in Jabish Gilead by the mouth of the broadsword, even the women and the people!

11. And this is the word which you shall do. Every male and every woman knowing the marriage-bed of a man you shall devote to consumption.

12. And they found of ones dwelling Jabish Gilead four hundred young women virgins, the ones that knew not a man, in the marriage-bed of a man. And they led them into the camp in Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan.

13. And [4sent 1all 2the 3congregation] and spoke to the sons of Benjamin, of the ones at the rock of Rimmon, and they called them for peace.

14. And Benjamin returned to the sons of Israel in  that time, and they gave them the women who were of the women of Jabish Gilead, and it pleased them thus.

15. And the people were comforted concerning  Benjamin, for [3made 1the 2 lord] a breach among the tribes of Israel.

16. And [5said 1the 2elders 3of the 4congregation], What shall we do to the remaining for  wives, now that [2was removed 3from  4Benjamin 1the woman]?

17. And he said, An inheritance for the ones surviving to Benjamin, that in no way [2should be wiped away 1a tribe] from Israel.

18. For we are not able to give to them wives from  our daughters, for [4swore by an oath 1the 2sons 3of Israel], saying, Accursed is the one giving a wife  to Benjamin.

19. And they said, Behold, there is a holiday to the lord in Shiloh from days to days, which is from the north  of Beth-el, according to the rising of the sun, upon the corridor  ascending from Beth-el unto Shechem, and from south of Lebonah. 

20.  Benjamin Snatches Wives from Shiloh And they gave charge to the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go forth and lie in wait at the vineyards!

21. And look and behold, whenever [6should come forth 1the 2daughters 3of the ones 4dwelling in 5Shiloh] joining in a dance with a company of dancers, then you shall come forth from the vineyards, and let [2seize by force 3to himself 1a man] a wife from the daughters of Shiloh! then you shall depart unto the land of Benjamin.

22. And it will be whenever [4should come  1their fathers 2or  3their brothers] to quarrel with us, that we shall say to them, Show mercy on them! for [2did not take 1a man] to himself a wife in the battle, for you did not give to them according to the time which you trespassed.

23. And [4did 5thus 1the 2sons 3of Benjamin]; and they took wives according to  their number from the ones dancing, whom they snatched. And they went and returned unto  their inheritance, and they built up the cities, and dwelt in them.

24. And [4walked 5from there 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in  that time, each man to  his tribe, and to  his kin; and [2went forth 3from there 1each man] to  his inheritance.

25. In  those days there was not a king in Israel. A man [2the 3upright thing 4in 5his eyes 1did].
