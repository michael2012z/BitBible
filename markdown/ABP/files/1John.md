# 1 John

## 1 John 1

1.  Fellowship with Jesus Which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we were spectators of, and  our hands handled concerning the word of the life;

2. (and the life was made manifest, and we have seen, and bear witness, and announce to you the [2life  1eternal] which was with the father, and was made manifest to us,)

3. which we have seen and have heard we report to you, that also you [2fellowship 1should have] with us; and [2the 3fellowship 1indeed], the one of ours is with the father, and with  his son Jesus Christ.

4. And these things we write to you, that  our joy is being full.

5. And this is the promise which we have heard from him, and we announce to you, that  God is light, and darkness [3in 4him 1is not 2in any way].

6. If we should say that [2fellowship 1we have] with him, and in the darkness should walk, we lie, and we do not observe the truth.

7. But if [2in 3the 4light 1we should walk], as he is in the light, [2fellowship 1we have] with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ  his son cleanses us from all sin.

8. If we should say that [2sin 1we do not have], we mislead ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

9. If we should acknowledge  our sins, he is trustworthy and just that he should have forgiven us the sins, and should have cleansed us from all iniquity.

10. If we should say that we have not sinned, [3a liar 1we make 2him], and  his word is not in us.  

## 1 John 2

1.  Abiding in Christ My sons, these things I write to you, that you should not sin. And if any should sin, [2a comforter 1we have] with the father– Jesus Christ the righteous.

2. And he is atonement for  our sins; [2not 4for  5ours 1but 3only], but also for the whole world.

3. And by this we know that we have known him– if the commandments of his we keep.

4. The one saying, I know him, and  his commandments is not keeping, is a liar, and [4in 5this one 1the 2truth 3is not].

5. But who ever should give heed of his  word, truly in this one the love  of God has been perfected. By this we know that [2in 3him 1we are].

6. The one saying [2in 3him 1to be abiding], ought as that one walked, also himself so to walk.

7. Brethren, [2do not 6commandment 5a new 1I 3write 4to you], but [2commandment 1an old], which you had from the beginning. The [2commandment  1old] is the word which you heard from the beginning.

8. Again, [2commandment 1a new] I write to you, which is true in him, and in you, because the darkness passes away, and the [2light  1true] already shines forth.

9. The one saying [2in 3the 4light 1to be], and  [2his brother 1detests], [2in 3the 4darkness 1is] until now.

10. The one loving  his brother [2in 3the 4light 1abides], and [2cause of offence 3in 4him 1there is no].

11. But the one detesting  his brother [2in 3the 4darkness 1is], and in the darkness walks, and does not know where he goes, because the darkness blinded  his eyes.

12. I write to you, sons, for [3have been forgiven 4to you 1the 2sins] through  his name.

13. I write to you, fathers, because you have known the one from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, children, because you have known the father.

14. I wrote to you, fathers, because you have known the one from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word  of God [2in 3you 1abides], and you have overcome the wicked one. 

15.  Love Not the World Do not love the world, nor the things in the world! If anyone should love the world, [5is not 1the 2love 3of the 4father] in him;

16. for every thing in the world– the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentatiousness  of existence, is not of the father, but [2of 3the 4world 1is].

17. And the world passes away, and the desire of it; but the one doing the will  of God abides into the eon.

18. Children, [2the last 3hour 1it is]; and as you heard that the antichrist comes, and now [2antichrists 1many] exist, whereupon we know that [2the last 3hour 1it is].

19. From us they went forth, but they were not of us; for if they were of us, they would have remained with us; but it was that they should be made manifest that [3not 2are 1all] of us.

20. And you [2an anointing 1have] from the holy one, and you know all things.

21. I wrote not to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and that every lie [3of 4the 5truth 2not 1is].

22. Who is the liar, if not the one denying, saying that, Jesus is not the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one denying the father and the son.

23. Every one  denying the son, neither [2the 3father 1has].

24. You then, what you heard from the beginning, [2in 3you 1let it abide]! If [6in 7you 5should abide 1what 3from 4the beginning 2you heard], then you [2in 3the 4son 5and 6in 7the 8father 1shall abide].

25. And this is the promise which he promised to us -- the life  eternal.

26. These things I wrote to you concerning the ones misleading you.

27. And you -- the anointing which you received from him [2in 3you 1abides], and [2no 3need 1you have] that any should teach you; but, as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and as it taught you, you shall abide in him.

28. And now, sons, abide in him! that whenever he should be made manifest, we should have an open manner, and we should not be ashamed before him at  his arrival.

29. If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one  doing the righteousness [2of 3him 1is engendered].  

## 1 John 3

1.  Be Imitators of Christ Behold! what kind of love [3has given 4to us 1the 2father], that [2children 3of God 1we should be called]. On account of this the world does not know us, because it did not know him.

2. Beloved, now [2children 3of God 1we are], and not yet was it manifested what we will be; but we know that if he should be manifested, [2likened 3to him 1we will be]; for we shall see him as he is.

3. And every one  having  this hope upon him, purifies himself, as that one is pure.

4. Every one  committing  sin, also  [2lawlessness 1commits]; and  sin is  lawlessness.

5. And you know that that one was made manifest, that  [2our sins 1he should lift away]; and sin [3in 4him 2not 1is].

6. Anyone  [2in 3him 1abiding], does not sin; anyone  sinning has not seen him nor has known him.

7. Sons, let no one mislead you! The one executing the righteousness is righteous, as that one is righteous.

8. The one committing  sin [2of 3the 4devil 1is], for from the beginning the devil sins. For this [4was made manifest 1the 2son  3of God], that he should loosen the works of the devil.

9. Anyone  engendered of  God, [3sin 1does not 2commit], for his seed [2in 3him 1abides]; and he is not able to sin, because [2by  3God 1he has been engendered]. 

10.  Love the Brethren In this [4are apparent 1the 2children  3of God], and the children of the devil. Every one  not executing righteousness is not of  God, even the one not loving  his brother.

11. For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

12. Not as Cain [2of 3the 4wicked one 1who was], and slew  his brother. And for what favor did he slay him? because  his works were wicked, but the ones  of his brother righteous.

13. Do not marvel, my brethren, if [3detests 4you 1the 2world]!

14. We know that we have crossed over from  death into  life, for we love the brethren. The one not loving the brethren, abides in  death.

15. Every one  detesting  his brother is a man-killer; and you know that every man-killer does not have life eternal [2in 3him 1abiding].

16. By this we have known the love  of God, because that one [3for 4us  2his life 1placed]; and we ought [3for 4the 5brethren  2our lives 1to place].

17. But who ever should have the livelihood of the world, and should view  his brother [2need 1having], and should lock up  his feelings of compassion from him, how does the love  of God abide in him?

18. My sons, we should not love in word nor tongue, but in work and truth.

19. And in this we know that [2of 3the 4truth 1we are], and before him we shall yield  our hearts.

20. For if [3should condemn 1our  2heart], know that [3greater than 2is  1God]  our heart, and he knows all things.

21. Beloved, if  our heart should not condemn us, [2confidence 1we have] before  God.

22. And what ever we should ask, we receive from him, for  his commandments we keep, and the things pleasing before him we do.

23. And this is  his commandment -- that we should believe in the name  of his son Jesus Christ, and we should love one another, as he gave commandment.

24. And the one keeping  his commandments [2in 3him 1abides], and he in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the spirit which he gave to us.  

## 1 John 4

1.  Distinguish the Spirits Beloved, [2not 3every 4spirit 1believe], but distinguish the spirits, if [2of  3God 1they are]! for many false prophets have gone forth into the world.

2. By this you know the spirit  of God -- every spirit which acknowledges Jesus Christ [2in 3flesh 1having come 5of  6God 4is].

3. And every spirit which does not acknowledge  Jesus Christ [2in 3flesh 1having come 5of  6God 4is not]. And this is the thing of the antichrist, which you heard that it comes, and [2now 3in 4the 5world 1is] already.

4. You [2of  3God 1are], sons, and have overcome them; for greater is the one in you, than the one in the world.

5. They [2of 3the 4world 1are]; because of this [2of 3the 4world 1they speak], and the world hears them.

6. We [2of  3God 1are]; the one knowing  God, hears us; the one who is not of  God, does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of the truth and the spirit of the delusion. 

7.  Love One Another Beloved, we should love one another, for  love [2of  3God 1is]; and every one  loving [2of  3God 1is engendered], and knows  God.

8. The one not loving does not know  God, for  God is love.

9. In this was made manifest the love  of God in us, that  his son, the only born, God sent into the world, that we should live through him.

10. In this is the love, not that we loved  God, but that he loved us, and sent  his son as an atonement for  our sins.

11. Beloved, if thus  God loved us, also we ought [2one another 1to love].

12. [3God 1No one 4at any time 2has seen]. If we should love one another,  God [2in 3us 1abides], and  his love has been perfected in us.

13. By this we know that in him we abide, and he in us -- that of the spirit of him he has given to us.

14. And we have seen, and we bear witness that the father has sent the son as deliverer of the world.

15. Who ever should acknowledge that Jesus is the son  of God,  God [2in 3him 1abides], and he in  God.

16. And we have known and have believed the love which God has for us.  God is love; and the one abiding in the love, [2in  3God 1abides], and  God in him.

17. In this [3has been perfected 1the 2love] with us, that [2confidence 1we should have] in the day of the judgment; for as that one is, also we are in  this world.

18. Fear is not in the love, but the perfect love [3outside 1casts  2fear]; for  fear [2punishment 1holds], and the one fearing has not been made perfect in love.

19. We love him, for he first loved us.

20. If anyone should say that, I love  God, and  [2his brother 1should detest], he is a liar. For the one not loving  his brother, whom he has seen,  [4God 5whom 6he has not 7seen 1how 2is he able 3to love]?

21. And this  commandment we have from him, that the one loving  God, should love also  his brother.  

## 1 John 5

1.  Love God Every one  believing that Jesus is the Christ, [2by  3God 1is engendered]; and every one  loving the one engendering, loves also the one being engendered by him.

2. By this we know that we love the children  of God, whenever  we love God, and  [2his commandments 1should keep].

3. For this is the love  of God, that the commandments of his we should keep; and  his commandments [2heavy 1are not].

4. For every one  being engendered by  God overcomes the world; and this is the victory in the overcoming the world -- the belief of ours.

5. Who is the one overcoming the world, unless it be the one believing that Jesus is the son  of God?

6. This is the one coming by water and blood -- Jesus the Christ; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood; and the spirit is the one witnessing, for the spirit is the truth.

7. For three are the ones bearing witness in the heaven -- the father, and the word and the holy spirit; and the three in one are. And three are the ones witnessing upon the earth –

8. the spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three [2in 3the 4one 1are].

9. If the witness of the men we receive, the witness  of God is greater; for this is the witness  of God which he has witnessed concerning  his son.

10. The one believing in the son  of God, he has the witness in himself; the one not believing  in God, [3a liar 1has made 2him], for he has not believed in the witness which [2has witnessed  1God] concerning  his son.

11. And this is the witness -- that [5life 4eternal 2gave 3to us  1God], and this  life [2in  3his son 1is].

12. The one having the son, has the life; the one not having the son  of God,  [3life 1does not 2have].

13. These things I wrote to you, to the ones believing in the name of the son  of God; that you should know that [3life 2eternal 1you have], and that you should believe in the name of the son  of God. 

14.  Asking in Confidence And this is the confidence which we have with him, that if anything we should ask according to  his will, he hears us.

15. And if we know that he hears us, what ever we should ask, we know that we have the requests which we ask from him.

16. If anyone should see  his brother sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask, and he shall give to him life, to the ones not sinning to death. There is sin to death; not concerning that do I say that he should ask.

17. Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is sin not to death.

18. We know that every one  being engendered of  God does not sin; but the one engendered of  God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.

19. We know that [2of  3God 1we are], and the [2world 1whole 4to 5the 6evil one 3is situated].

20. And we know that the son  of God has come, and has given to us thought that we should know the one true; and we are in the one true, in  his son Jesus Christ. This one is the true God, and the life eternal.

21. Sons, guard yourselves from the idols! Amen.
