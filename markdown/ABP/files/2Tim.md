# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1.  Paul's Longing to See Timothy Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to promise of life of the one in Christ Jesus.

2. To Timothy my beloved son, favor, mercy, peace from God the father, and Christ Jesus  our Lord.

3. Gratitude I have to God, in whom I serve from my precursors, with a clean conscience, how continually I have the [2concerning 3you 1memory] in  my supplications night and day;

4. longing to see you, remembering your  tears, that with joy I should be filled;

5. [2recollection 1taking] of the [3in 4you 1unpretentious 2belief], which dwelt first in  your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that also is in you. 

6.  Rekindle the Favor of God For which reason I remind you to rekindle the favor  of God, which is in you by the laying on  of my hands.

7. [3did not 1For 4give 5to us  2God] a spirit of dread, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

8. Therefore you should not be ashamed of the testimony  of our Lord, nor me  his prisoner; but suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God!

9. of the one preserving us, and having called [2calling 1with a holy], not according to  our works, but according to his own intention and favor, the one having been given to us in Christ Jesus before times everlasting;

10. and made manifest now through the grandeur  of our deliverer Jesus Christ, the one clearing away indeed  death, and having enlightened life and incorruptibility through the good news;

11. in which I was appointed herald, and apostle, and teacher of nations.

12. For which reason also these things I suffer; but I am not ashamed, for I know in whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able  [2my deposit in his care 1to keep] for that  day. 

13.  Speak Healthy Words [2a pattern 1Have] of healthy words! which [2by 3me 1you heard] in belief and love, in the one in Christ Jesus.

14. [2the 3good 4trust 1Guard] through [2spirit 1holy], of the one dwelling in us!

15. Know this, that they turned away from me-- all the ones in  Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16. May [3give 4mercy 1the 2Lord] to the house of Onesiphorus, for often he refreshed me, and  [3of my chain 1he was not 2ashamed];

17. but being in Rome, more diligently he sought me, and found me.

18. May [3grant 4to him 1the 2Lord] to find mercy from the Lord in that  day, and for as much as in Ephesus he served-- better you know it.  

## 2 Timothy 2

1.  Endure Hardship You then, my child, be empowered in the favor, in the one in Christ Jesus!

2. And the things you heard from me through many witnesses, these things place unto trustworthy men, ones who will be fit also [2others 1to teach]!

3. You then suffer hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ!

4. No one soldiering entangles himself in the  [2existence 1matters of]; that [2the 3one recruiting him 1he should have pleased].

5. And if also anyone should fight, he is not crowned if [2not 4lawfully 1he should 3fight].

6. The [3tire by labor 1farmer 2must] before first [2the 3fruits 1sharing].

7. Comprehend what I say! [2may 5give 1for 6to you 3the 4Lord] understanding in all things.

8. Remember Jesus Christ being raised from the dead! from the seed of David, according to  my good news,

9. in which I suffer hardship unto bonds as an evildoer; but the word  of God is not bound.

10. Because of this [2all things 1I endure] on account of the chosen, that also they [2deliverance 1should attain], of the one in Christ Jesus with [2glory 1eternal].

11. Trustworthy is the word, For if we died together, also we shall live together;

12. if we endure, also we shall reign together; if we deny, that one also will deny us;

13. if we disbelieve, that one is sure to abide; to deny himself he is not able.

14. These things be reminded! testifying before the Lord not to argue over words, for no profit unto the undoing of the ones hearing.

15. Hurry [2yourself 3unadulterated 1to present]  to God! a worker unashamed, cutting straight the word  of truth.

16. And the profane idle talk stand from! [2unto 3more 1for] they will progress in impious deeds,

17. and  their word as a gangrenous pasture holds forth; whom is Hymeneus and Philetus;

18. who concerning the truth miss the aim, saying, The resurrection already has taken place; and are upsetting the belief of some.

19.  However [4solid 1the foundation  2of God 3stands], having  this seal, The Lord knows the ones being his, and, Let [6abstain 7from 8iniquity 1every one  2naming 3the 4name 5of Christ]!

20. [2in 3a great 1But] house not only are there utensils of gold and silver, but also wooden and earthenware, and some for honor, but others for dishonor.

21. If then one should have cleared himself from these, he shall be a utensil for honor, having been sanctified and useful to the master, [2for 3every 5work 4good 1having been prepared].

22. But the youthful desires flee from, and pursue righteousness, belief, love, peace with the ones calling upon the Lord out of a clean heart!

23. But the moronish and uninstructed inquiries ask pardon from! knowing that they engender fights.

24. And a bondman of the Lord must not quarrel; but be calm to all, qualified for teaching, enduring evil,

25. in gentleness correcting the ones being in opposition; lest at any time [2should give 3to them  1God] a change of heart to full knowledge of truth;

26. and they should recover from out of the [2of the 3devil 1snare], having been taken alive by him for  that ones's will.  

## 2 Timothy 3

1.  Evil Men in the Last Days But this know! that in the last days [3will be present 2times 1ill-tempered];

2. [3will be 1for  2men] fond of themselves, fond of money, ostentatious, proud, blasphemous, [2of parents 1resisting the persuasion], ungracious, unholy,

3. unaffectionate, hostile, devilish, immoderate, untamed, disliking good,

4. betrayers, precipitous, being deluded, friends of pleasure rather than friends of God;

5. having the appearance of piety,  but [2its power 1denying]. Even these turn away from!

6. [2from out of 3these 1For] are the ones entering into the houses, and capturing the vain women heaped with sins, being led [2desires 1by various],

7. at all times learning, and not at any time [3in 4full knowledge 5of the truth 2to come 1being able].

8. [2in which manner 1And] Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth; men being corrupted in the mind, unproved concerning the belief.

9. But they shall not progress unto more;  for their thoughtlessness will be evident to all, as also  their's was. 

10.  Imitate Paul's Conduct But you have closely followed my  instruction in the conduct, in the intention, in the belief, in the long-suffering, in the love, in the endurance,

11. in the persecutions, in the sufferings, such as happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra-- of such persecutions I endured. And from out of all [3rescued me 1the 2Lord].

12. [2even 3all 1But] the ones wanting [2piously 1to live] in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted.

13. But wicked men and impostors shall progress unto the worse, misleading, and being misled.

14. But you abide in the things which you learned, and were trustworthy! knowing from whom you learned.

15. And that from a babe [2the 3consecrated 4writings 1you knew], the ones being able to make you wise unto deliverance, through belief, of the one in Christ Jesus. 

16.  Scripture Is God Inspired Every scripture is God inspired, and beneficial for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction-- the one in righteousness;

17. that [5complete 4should be 1the  3of God 2man] for [2every 4work 3good 1accomplishing].  

## 2 Timothy 4

1.  Preach the Word [2testify 3then 1I] in the presence of  God and the Lord Jesus Christ, of the one being about to judge the living and the dead, according to  his grandeur and  his kingdom.

2. Proclaim the word! Attend opportunely and inopportunely! Reprove! Reproach! Comfort in all long-suffering and teaching!

3. For there will be a time when  [3healthy 4teaching 1they will not 2endure], but according to  [2desires 1their own 4to themselves 3they will accumulate] teachers tickling the hearing.

4. And from indeed the truth, the one hearing, they shall turn away, [3unto 1and 4the 5fables 2they shall be turned aside].

5. But you be sober in all things! Suffer hardships! [2the work 1Do] of an evangelist!  Of your service have full assurance! 

6.  Paul's Struggle For I already am offered as a libation, and the time  of my separation stands by.

7. The [2struggle  1good] I have struggled; the race I have finished; the belief I have kept.

8. Remaining reserved for me is the  [2of righteousness 1crown], which [6will recompense 7to me 1the 2Lord 8in 9that  10day 3the 4righteous 5judge]; [2not 3only 1and] to me, but also to all the ones loving  his grandeur.

9. Hurry to come to me quickly!

10. for Demas abandoned me, having loved the present eon, and is gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

11. Luke is alone with me. Having taken up Mark, bring him with yourself, for he is useful to me in service!

12. And Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.

13. The hooded cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, when coming bring, and the scrolls, especially the parchments!

14. Alexander the brazier [2many 4against me 3bad things 1demonstrated]; may [3render 4to him 1the 2Lord] according to  his works--

15. the one whom you also watch out for! for exceedingly he has opposed  our words.

16. In  my first defense no one came together with me, but all abandoned me. [2not 4against them 1May it 3be imputed].

17. But the Lord stood by me, and empowered me, that through me the proclamation should be fully assured, and [4should hear 1all 2the 3nations]. And I was rescued from the mouth of the lion.

18. And [3shall rescue 4me 1the 2Lord] from every [2work 1evil], and shall preserve me for  [3kingdom 1his  2heavenly]; to whom be the glory into the eons of the eons. Amen.

19. Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus!

20. Erastus stayed in Corinth, but Trophimus I left in Miletus sick.

21. Hurry before winter to come! [2greets 3you 1Eubulus], and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and [2the 3brethren 1all].

22. The Lord Jesus Christ be with  your spirit.  Favor be with you. Amen.
