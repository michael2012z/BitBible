# Malachi

## Malachi 1

1.  The LORD Loves Jacob The concern of the word of the lord over  Israel by the hand of his messenger.

2. I loved you, says the lord. And you said, [3in 4what 1You loved 2us]? [2not 5brother 1Was 3Esau  4Jacob's]? says the lord; and I loved  Jacob.

3. And Esau I detested, and I ordered up  his borders for extinction, and  his inheritance for domiciles of the wilderness.

4. Because [2will say,  1Edom], He was eradicated, and we should return and should rebuild places having been made desolate. Thus says the lord almighty, They shall build, and I shall eradicate; and it shall be called by them, Borders of lawlessness, and, a people against whom the lord deployed unto the eon.

5. And  your eyes shall see, and you shall say, The lord was magnified up above the borders  of Israel. 

6.  The Priests Dishonor The LORD A son glorifies a father, and a servant  his master. And if [3father 2am 1I], where is  my glory? And if [3the lord 2am 1I], where is the fear of me, says the lord almighty? You, the priests, are the ones treating [2as worthless  1my name]. And you said, [3in 4what 1We treated as worthless  2your name]?

7. In bringing to  my altar [2bread loaves 1polluted]. And you say, [2in 3what 1We polluted]? In  your saying, The table of the lord is polluted; and the things being placed upon it are thereby treated with contempt.

8. For if you should bring a blind animal for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you should bring the lame or ill, is it not evil? Bring it indeed to him, to the one leading you; shall he favorably receive you, shall he receive your person, says the lord almighty, no.

9. And now, atone the face  of your God, and beseech him! By your hands these have taken place. Shall I receive from your person your things, says the lord almighty, no.

10. Because even among you [2shall be closed 1the doors], and you shall not light  my altar gratuitously. There is not of me anything wanting among you, says the lord almighty. A sacrifice I shall not favorably receive from out of  your hands.

11. For from the rising of the sun, and unto the descent,  my name was glorified among the nations; and in every place incense is brought  in my name -- even [2sacrifice 1a pure]. For great  is my name among the nations, says the lord almighty.

12. But you profane it in  your saying, The table of the lord is polluted; and  [3placed upon it 4are treated with contempt 2foods 1his].

13. And you said, Behold, it is troublesome. And you blew them away, says the lord almighty; and you carried in the prey, and the lame, and the troubled. And thus you brought in the sacrifice. Shall I favorably receive them from  your hands, says the lord almighty, no.

14. And accursed be the man who was mighty, and [2existed 3among  4his flock 1a male], and  his vow was upon him, and he sacrifices a thing being corrupted to the lord. For [4king 3great 1I 2am], says the lord almighty, and  my name is prominent among the nations.  

## Malachi 2

1.  The LORD Sends a Curse on the Priests And now  this commandment is to you, O priests.

2. If you should not hearken, and if you should not put it into  your heart,  to give glory to my name, says the lord almighty, then I will send upon you the curse, and I will accurse  your blessing -- even I will curse it, and it will not be among you, for you put it not to  your heart.

3. Behold, I separate to you the shoulder, and I will disperse dung of the large intestine upon  your faces, dung of the large intestine of your holiday feasts; and I will take you away at the same time.

4. And you shall realize that I sent out to you  this commandment,  to be  my covenant with the Levites, says the lord almighty.

5.  My covenant was with him, the one of life and  of peace; and I gave to him fear to fear me, and from the presence of my name to put him in readiness.

6. The law of truth was in  his mouth, and injustice was not found in his lips. In peace he straightened out to go with me; and many he turned from iniquity.

7. For lips of priests shall guard knowledge, and [2the law 1they shall seek] from his mouth; for [2a messenger 3of the lord 4almighty 1he is].

8. But you turned aside from the way, and you weakened many in following the law; you corrupted the covenant  of Levi, says the lord almighty.

9. And I have given you over as ones being treated with contempt, and ones being disregarded among all the nations, because you guarded not  my ways, but you took persons in the law.

10. Is there not [2father 1one] of all of you? Did not [2God 1one] create you? For what reason did you abandoned each  his brother,  to profane the covenant  of your fathers?

11. Judah abandoned, and an abomination took place in  Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah profaned the holy things of the lord in which he loved, and applied unto alien gods.

12. The lord will utterly destroy the man  doing these things, until whenever he should be humbled from out of the tents of Jacob, and from out of the ones bringing a sacrifice to the lord almighty.

13. And these things which I detested you did. You covered [4in tears 1the 2altar 3of the lord] in weeping and moaning because of troubles, yet thinking it worthy to look upon your sacrifice, or to take as acceptable from out of  your hands. 

14.  Treachery of Infidelity And you said, For what reason? In that the lord testified between you and between the wife of your youth, whom you abandoned. And she is your partner, and the wife of your covenant.

15. But did he not [2good 1do], even a vestige of his spirit? And you said, What other than a seed does God seek? But guard in  your spirit, and the wife of your youth do not abandon!

16. But if by detesting, you should send her forth, says the lord  God  of Israel, then [2shall cover 1impiety] over  your thoughts, says the lord  God almighty. And keep guard in  your spirit, and in no way should you abandon them,

17. O ones provoking  the lord with  your words. And you said, [3in 4what 1We provoked 2him]? In  your saying, Every one doing wicked is good before the lord, and in them he thinks well of; and, Where is the God  of righteousness?  

## Malachi 3

1.  The Messenger of the Covenant Behold, I send out  my messenger who shall prepare the way before my face. And [5shall suddenly 6come 7into  8his temple 1the lord 2whom 3you 4seek], even the messenger of the covenant, whom you want. Behold, he comes, says the lord almighty.

2. And who will endure the day of his entrance? Or who shall stand at  his apparition? For he enters as fire of a foundry furnace, and as lye of ones washing.

3. And he shall sit as one casting in a furnace, and one cleansing as it were  silver. And he shall cleanse the sons of Levi, and he shall pour them as the gold and as the silver; and they will be to the lord ones bringing sacrifices in  righteousness.

4. And [5shall please 6the 7 lord, 1the sacrifice 2of Judah 3and 4Jerusalem], as in the days of the eon; and as the years  before.

5. And I will come forward to you in judgment; and I will be [2witness 1a quick] against the administers of potions, and against the adulterers, and against the ones swearing by an oath  in my name for a lie, and against the ones depriving a wage of a hireling, and tyrannizing over the widow, and the ones smiting orphans, and the ones turning aside a right judgment of a foreigner, even they are the ones not fearing me, says the lord almighty.

6. For I am the lord  your God; I change not. 

7.  Israel Keeps the Tenth Parts But you sons of Jacob are not kept at a distance from the sins  of your fathers; you turned aside from my laws, and guarded not. Return to me! and I shall be turned towards you, says the lord almighty. But you said, In what way should we turn?

8. Shall [2stomp on 1a man] God, no. For you stomp on me. And you said, [3in 4what 1We stomped on 2you]? In that the tenth parts, and the first-fruits [2with 3you 1are].

9. And looking away, you look away, and me you stomp on.

10. The year is completed, and you carried in all the resources into the storehouses, and there will be the ravaging in  your houses. Restore indeed in this, says the lord almighty! And see if I should not open to you the torrents of the heaven, and pour out to you  my blessing until  it is enough.

11. And I will draw apart to you for food, and in no way will I utterly destroy the fruit of the land; and in no way should it be weakened upon your  grapevine  in the field, says the lord almighty.

12. And [4shall declare you happy 1all 2the 3nations]. For you will be [2land 1a wanted], says the lord almighty.

13. You weighed down against me  by your words, says the lord. And you said, [4in 5what 1We spoke ill 2against 3you]?

14. You said, [4is vain 1The one 2serving 3God]. and, What more is it that we kept  his injunctions, and that we go as supplicants before the face of the lord almighty?

15. And now we declare [2blessed 1aliens]; and [5are built up 1all 2the ones 3doing 4lawless deeds]; and they opposed God, and were preserved.

16. [6these things 5spoke 1The ones 2fearing 3the 4 lord] each to  his neighbor. And the lord heeded, and hearkened, and wrote a scroll of memorial before him to the ones fearing the lord, and venerating his name.

17. And they will be to me, says the lord almighty, in the day which I prepare for a procurement. And I will select them in which manner [2selects 1a man]  his son, the one serving to him.

18. Then shall you be turned, and you shall see between the just one and the wrongdoer; and between the one serving God and the one not serving to him.  

## Malachi 4

1.  The Great Day of The LORD Almighty For behold, a day comes burning as an oven; and it shall blaze against them, and [4will be 1all 2the 3foreigners], and all the ones doing lawless deeds, as stubble. And [4shall light 5them 1the 2day  3coming], says the lord of the forces; and in no way shall there be left of them root nor vine branch.

2. And to you, O ones fearing  my name, shall arise sun of righteousness, and healing is in  his wings; and you shall come forth and shall leap as young calves [2from out of 3bonds 1being spared].

3. And you shall trample the lawless ones; and they will be ashes underneath  your feet in the day which I prepare, says the lord almighty.

4. Remember the law of Moses  my manservant, in so far as I gave charge to him in Horeb for all  Israel -- orders and judgments! 

5.  The Coming of Elijah And behold, I shall send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming day of the lord -- the great and apparent;

6. the one who shall restore the heart of the father to the son, and the heart of a man to  his neighbor, lest coming I strike the earth entirely.
