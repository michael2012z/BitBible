# Ruth

## Ruth 1

1.  Elimelech and Naomi Go to Moab And it came to pass in the days in the judging of the judges. And came to pass a famine in the land. And went forth a man from Beth-lehem  of Judea  to sojourn in the field of Moab, he, and  his wife, and  [2two 3sons 1his].

2. And the name to the man was Elimelech, and the name to his wife was Naomi, and the name to [2two 3sons 1his] -- Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from Beth-lehem  of Judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and were there. 

3.  Death of Naomi's Husband and Sons And [5died 1Elimelech 2the 3husband  4of Naomi], and [6were left 1she 2and  4two 5sons 3her].

4. And they took to themselves Moabite wives; the name to the one was Orpah, and the name to the second Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.

5. And [7died 1also 2indeed 3both 4Mahlon 5and 6Chilion]. And [3was left 1the 2woman] of  [2two 3sons 1her], and of  her husband.

6. And she rose up, and  [2two 3daughter-in-laws 1her], and they returned from out of the country of Moab; for they heard in the country of Moab that the lord visited  his people  to give to them bread loaves.

7. And she went forth from out of the place of which she was there, and  [2two 3daughter-in-laws 1her] with her; and they went by  journey  to return to the land of Judah.

8. And Naomi said to [2two 3daughters-in-law 1her], Go please! Let [2return 1each] to the house of her mother! May the lord deal [2with 3you 1mercy], as you did with the ones having died, and with me.

9. May the lord give to you that you should find rest each in the house of her husband. And she kissed them, and they lifted up  their voice and wept.

10. And they said to her, [2with 3you 1We shall return] unto  your people.

11. And Naomi said, Return please, my daughters! Why do you go with me? Are there still to me sons in  my belly, and will they be to you for husbands?

12. Turn back please, my daughters! Go please! for I grow old  to not have a husband. For I said, Is it to me a reality  to be to me a husband, and shall I give birth to sons?

13. Shall you wait for them until of which time they should become manly? Or, for them shall you hold up  to not have a husband? No, my daughters; for it is made bitter to me exceedingly for you, that [3came forth 4against 5me 1the hand 2of the lord].

14. And they lifted up  their voice and wept again. And Orpah kissed  her mother-in-law, and turned back to  her people. But Ruth followed her.

15. And Naomi said to Ruth, Behold, [3returned  2sister-in-law 1your] to  her people, and to  her gods; [4turn back 3please 2also 1you] after  your sister-in-law! 

16.  Ruth Returns with Naomi [3said 1And 2Ruth], Do not confront me  to leave you or to turn behind you! For you -- where ever you should go, I shall go; and where ever you should lodge, I shall lodge.  Your people shall be my people, and  your God my God.

17. And where ever you should die, I shall die, and there I shall be entombed. Thus [2do 1the lord] to me! and thus may he add more. For death only shall separate between me and you.

18. [3seeing 1And 2Naomi] that she was determined  to go with her, she abated  to speak to her any more.

19. [3went 1And 2both] until  their arriving in Beth-lehem. And it came to pass in  their coming unto Beth-lehem, that [4resounded 1all 2the 3city] concerning them. And they said, Is this Naomi?

20. And she said to them, Do not indeed call me Naomi! Call me, Bitter one! for [3embittered  4me 1the 2worthy one] exceedingly.

21. I went out full, and [4empty 2returned 3me 1the lord]. And why do you call me Naomi, and the lord humbled me, and the worthy one afflicted me?

22. And Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess,  her daughter-in-law, with her, to return from the country of Moab. And they came unto Beth-lehem at the beginning [2harvest 1of barley].  

## Ruth 2

1.  Ruth Gleans Boaz's Field And to Naomi was a male acquaintance to her husband, and the man was mighty in strength of the kin of Elimelech; and the name to him was Boaz.

2. And [4said 1Ruth 2the 3Moabitess] to Naomi, I should go indeed into the field, and gather among the ears of corn after of whom ever I should find favor in his eyes. And she said to her, Go, O daughter!

3. And she went. And having arrived, she collected together in the field after the ones harvesting. And she fell by chance in the portion of the field of Boaz, the one of the kin of Elimelech.

4. And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and he said to the ones harvesting, The lord be with you. And they said to him, May [2bless 3you 1the lord].

5. And Boaz said to his servant, to the one having been set over the ones harvesting, Whose  young woman is this?

6. And [7answered 1the 2servant  3attending 4over 5the ones 6harvesting] and said, She [4servant 2the 3Moabitess 1is]  returning with Naomi from out of the country of Moab.

7. And she said, I shall collect together please, and I will bring in the sheaves behind the ones harvesting. And she came and stood, from morning and until evening, she did not rest in the field a little.

8. And Boaz said to Ruth, Did you not hear, O daughter? You should not go to collect into [2field 1another], and you should not go from here; [2here 1you join up] with  my young women!

9. And  let your eyes be unto the field where ever mine should harvest! and you should go after them. Behold, I gave charge to the servants  to not touch you. And when you shall thirst, then you shall go to the vessels, and you shall drink from where [3should draw water 1the 2servants].

10. And she fell upon her face, and did obeisance upon the ground, and said to him, Why is it that I found favor in your eyes  to recognize me, and I am a stranger?

11. And Boaz answered and said to her, By report it was reported to me all as much as you have done with  your mother-in-law after the dying  of your husband; and how you left behind  your father, and  your mother, and the land of your origin, and went to a people which you did not know yesterday and the third day before.

12. May the lord repay  your work, and may [2be  1your wage] full from the lord God of Israel, to whom you came to yield under  his wings.

13.  And she said, May I find favor in your eyes, O my master; for you comforted me, and because you spoke in your heart to your maidservant; and behold, I shall be as one  of your maidservants.

14. And [2said 3to her 1Boaz], Already it is the hour  to eat; draw near here! for you shall eat  of my bread loaves, and dip  your morsel in the vinegar. And Ruth sat by the side of the ones harvesting, and [2heaped up 3to her 1Boaz] toasted grain, and she ate, and was filled, and left.

15. And she rose up  to collect grain, and Boaz gave charge to his servants, saying,  Indeed, [2in the midst 3of the 4sheaves 1let her collect], and do not shame her!

16. And indeed in setting aside, you set aside for her of the things being heaped up, and allow her! and she shall collect, and you shall not reproach her.

17. And she collected in the field until evening, and she beat with a rod what she collected up, and it was about an ephah of barley.

18. And she carried it, and entered into the city. And [3saw  2mother-in-law 1her] what she collected, and Ruth brought forth to give to her what was left of what she was filled up with.

19. And [3said 4to her  2mother-in-law 1her], Where did you collect today? And where did you do it? May it be the one recognizing you a blessing. And Ruth reported to her mother-in-law where she did it. And she said, The name of the man with whom I did this today is Boaz.

20. [3said 1And 2Naomi] to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is the lord, for he abandoned not  his mercy with the living and with the ones having died. And [2said 3to her 1Naomi], [3is near 4to us 1The 2man], of the ones acting as next of kin -- he is of us.

21. And Ruth said to  her mother-in-law, And also he said to me, [2with 3the 4young men  5of mine 1You cleave]! until whenever they should finish all the harvest which belongs to me

22. And Naomi said to Ruth  her daughter-in-law, It is good, O daughter, that you went forth with  his young women, and they shall not meet with you in [2field 1another].

23. And Ruth cleaved to the young women  of Boaz  to collect until they completed the harvest of the barley, and the harvest of the wheat.  

## Ruth 3

1.  Naomi Instructs Ruth And she stayed with  her mother-in-law. And [4said 5to her 1Naomi  3mother-in-law 2her], O daughter, In no way shall I seek rest for you, that a good thing should happen to you.

2. And now, is not Boaz a near acquaintance to us, of whom you were with  his young women? Behold, he winnows at the threshing-floor of the barley this  night.

3. And you shall bathe, and anoint, and put  your clothes upon yourself, and ascend unto the threshing-floor! You should not make yourself known to the man, until  he finishes  eating and drinking.

4. And it will be at  his going to sleep, that you shall perceive the place where he sleeps there, and you shall go in, and uncover the things by his feet, and you shall go to sleep. And he shall report to you what you shall do.

5. [3said 1And 2Ruth] to her, All as much as you should tell to me I will do. 

6.  Ruth Follows Naomi's Instructions And she went down into the threshing-floor, and she did according to all as much as [2gave charge 3to her  1her mother-in-law].

7. And Boaz ate, and drank, and did good to his heart; and he went  to go to sleep in a portion of the pile. And she came in secret, and uncovered the things by his feet, and she went to sleep.

8. And it came to pass at  midnight, that [3was startled 1the 2man] and disturbed; and behold, a woman slept at his feet.

9. And he said, Who are you? And she said, I am Ruth,  your maidservant; and you shall put  your garment border upon  your maidservant, for [2a relative 1you are].

10. And Boaz said, Being blessed are you by the lord God, O daughter, for you did good in your mercy at the last over the first,  [2to not 3go 1for you] after the young men, whether poor or whether rich.

11. And now, O daughter, do not fear! All what ever you should say I will do for you. [6know 1For 2all 5tribe 3of the people 4of my] that [3a woman 4of ability 2are 1you].

12. And now truly [3a relative 1I 2am]; but indeed there is a relative in the land who is over me.

13. You lodge the night! and it will be in the morning, if he should act as next of kin for you -- good, let him act as next of kin! But if he should not want to act as next of kin for you, [2shall act as next of kin 3for you 1I]. As the lord lives, you go to sleep until morning!

14. And she went to sleep at his feet until morning.  And she rose up before  [2could recognize 1a man]  his neighbor. And Boaz said, Do not let it be known, that [2has come 1a woman] unto the threshing-floor!

15. And he said to her, Bring the apron, the one upon you, and hold it! And she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and placed them unto her. And she entered into the city.

16. And Ruth entered to  her mother-in-law. And she said, What is it, O daughter? And she reported to her all as much as [3did 4for her 1the 2man].

17. And she said,  [2six  3measures of barley 1these] he gave to me, for he said to me, You should not enter empty to  your mother-in-law.

18. And she said, Sit down, O daughter, until  you realize how  [2shall fall  1the matter]!  for [3should not 4be still 1the 2man] until whenever he should finish the matter today.  

## Ruth 4

1.  Boaz Redeems Ruth And Boaz ascended unto the gate, and sat there. And behold, the relative came near whom Boaz spoke of. And [2said 3to 4him 1Boaz], In turning aside, sit here in private! And he turned aside, and sat.

2. And Boaz took ten men from the elders of the city, and said, Sit here! And they sat.

3. And Boaz said to the one acting as next of kin, Concerning the portion of the field which is  of our brother  Elimelech, which he gave to Naomi, the one returning from out of the country of Moab,

4. that I said to myself, I will uncover  your ear, saying, You acquire it before the ones sitting down, and before the elders  of my people! If you are a acting as next of kin, then act as next of kin! But if not acting as next of kin, announce it to me! and I shall know. For there is no one besides you  to act as next of kin, and I am after you.  And he said, I am. I shall act as next of kin.

5. And Boaz said, In the day  you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, also of Ruth the Moabitess, wife of the one having died, even she [3acquire 1you 2must], so as to raise up the name of the one having died, for  his inheritance.

6. And [3said 1the 2relative], I shall not be able to act as next of kin myself, lest at any time I ruin  my right of inheritance. [3act as next of kin 2yourself 1You]  for my inheritance! for I shall not be able to act as next of kin.

7. And this was the ordinance in former times in  Israel for the right of inheritance, and for the equivalent,  to establish every matter. [2untied 1A man]  his sandal, and he gave it to his neighbor, to the one acting as next of kin  for his right of inheritance; and this was testimony in Israel.

8. And [3said 1the 2relative]  to Boaz, You acquire to yourself  my right of inheritance! And he untied  his sandal and gave it to him.

9. And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses today that I have acquired all the things  of Elimelech, and all as much as exists to  Chilion and  Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi.

10. And indeed, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon I have acquired for myself for wife,  to raise up the name of the one having died, for  his inheritance, and [5shall not 6be utterly destroyed 1the 2name 3of the one 4having died] from among  his brethren, and from the gate  of his place -- you are witnesses today.

11. And [7said 1all 2the 3people  4at 5the 6gate], We are witnesses. And the elders said, May the lord give  your wife, the one entering into  your house, to be as Rachel and as Leah, the ones who [2built 1both] the house of Israel, and did powerfully in Ephratah, and it will be a name in Beth-lehem.

12. And may [2become  1your house] as the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore  to Judah. Of  your seed may [2give 3to you 1the lord 5of  6this maidservant 4children]. 

13.  Boaz Takes Ruth for a Wife And Boaz took  Ruth, and she became to him for wife. And he entered to her. And [2gave 3to her 1the lord] conception, and she bore a son.

14. And [3said 1the 2women] to Naomi, Blessed be the lord who rested not to provide to you today  a relative; and may he call out  your name in Israel.

15. And he will be to you for restoring life, and  to nourish  your gray hair; for  your daughter-in-law, the one loving you, bore him, which is good to you above seven sons.

16. And Naomi took the boy, and put him to  her bosom, and became to him for a wet-nurse.

17. And [3called 4to him 1the 2neighbor women] the name, saying, [2was birthed 1A son] to Naomi. And they called  his name Obed. This one is father of Jesse, father of David. 

18.  Genealogy of Boaz And these are the generations of Pharez. Pharez engendered  Hezron,

19. and Hezron engendered  Ram, and Ram engendered  Amminadab,

20. and Aminadab engendered  Nahshon, and Nahshon engendered  Salmon,

21. and Salmon engendered  Boaz, and Boaz engendered  Obed,

22. and Obed engendered  Jesse, and Jesse engendered  David.
