# Nehemiah

## Nehemiah 1

1.  Nehemiah Prays and Fasts The words of Nehemiah son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month of Chislev, [2year 1in the twentieth], that I was in Susa Abira.

2. And there came Hanani one of my brethren, he and the men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews, of the ones having survived, the ones left behind from the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

3. And they said to me, The ones remaining behind  surviving from the captivity there in the place are among [2wickedness 1great], and in scorning; and the walls of Jerusalem are being demolished, and its gates were burnt by fire.

4. And it came to pass in  my hearing  these words, I sat and wept and mourned for days, and I was fasting and praying before the God  of heaven.

5. And I said, O indeed, O lord  God  of heaven, the strong and great and fearful one, guarding the covenant and the mercy to the ones loving him and to the ones guarding  his commandments.

6. Let it be indeed  your ear heeds, and  your eyes open  to hear the prayer  of your servant! which I pray before you today's day and night, for the sons of Israel your servants. And I declare openly concerning the sins of the sons of Israel, in which we sinned against you; both I and the house  of my father sinned.

7. In parting, we parted from you, and we guarded not the commandments, and the orders, and the judgments, which you gave charge to Moses your servant.

8. Remember indeed! the word which you gave charge to Moses, to your servant, saying, If [2should break contract 1You], I shall disperse you among the peoples.

9. But if you should return to me, and should guard  my commandments, and observe them; and if [2might be  1your dispersion] unto the tip of the heaven, from there I will gather them, and I will bring them into the place which I chose to encamp  my name there.

10. And they are your children and your people, whom you ransomed by  [3power 1your  2great], and by  [3hand 1your  2fortified].

11. Indeed, O lord, let be  your ear heeding to the prayer  of your servant, and to the prayer of your children! of the ones wanting to fear  your name. And prosper the way indeed  of your servant today, and give him for compassions before  this man! And I was a wine server to the king.  

## Nehemiah 2

1.  Nehemiah Asks Permission to Rebuild Jerusalem And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, [2year 1the twentieth] of Artaxerxes the king, that [3was 1the 2wine] before him. And I took the wine and gave it to the king, and there was no other before him.

2. And [3said 4to me 1the 2king], Why is your face in a sorry state, and you are not content? For [3not 1is 2this] unless there is a sorrowful heart. And I was afraid [2much 1exceedingly].

3. And I said to the king, O king, [2into 3the 4eon 1Live]! Why should not [3be 4sorry  2face 1my], for the city, the house of the sepulchres of my fathers, was made desolate, and  its gates were devoured by fire?

4. And [3said 4to me 1the 2king], For what is this you seek? And I prayed to the lord God  of heaven.

5. And I said to the king, If it be upon the king for good, and if [2shall seem good  1your servant] before you, so as to send him to Judah, to the city of the sepulchres of my fathers, then I will rebuild it.

6. And [3said 4to me 1the 2king], and  his concubine  sitting next to him, For how long will [2be  3going 1you], and when will you return? And it was good before the king. And he sent me, and I gave to him a confirmation.

7. And I said to the king, If it be upon the king for good, let him give to me letters to the chief rulers on the other side of the river! so as to allow me to pass until I come unto Judah;

8. and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the garden, which is to the king, so as to give to me wood to roof the gates of the palace of the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house, for which I shall enter unto it. And [3gave 4to me 1the 2king] by [3hand 4of God 1the 2good] upon me.

9. And I came to the chief rulers on the other side of the river, and I gave to them the letters of the king. And [3sent 4with 5me 1the 2king] chiefs of the force, and horsemen.

10. And [4heard of it 1Sanballat 2the 3Horonite], and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and it was a bad thing to them that it happened. And they were grieved that [2comes 1a man] to seek good to the sons of Israel.

11. And I came unto Jerusalem, and I was there [2days 1three]. 

12.  Nehemiah Surveys the Wall And I rose up at night, I and [2men 1a few] with me. And I did not report to a man, for  God put it into my heart  to do this with  Jerusalem. And [3beast 2no 1there is] with me, except the beast which I mounted upon it.

13. And I went forth through the gate of Gai at night to the mouth of the spring of the serpent, and to [3gate 1the 2dung]. And I was studying the walls of Jerusalem, the ones being torn down, and  her gates, the ones having been consumed by fire.

14. And I went by the gate of the fountain, and into the pool of the king. And there was no place for the beast [3to pass 1underneath 2me].

15. And I was ascending by the rushing stream at night. And I was studying the wall, and I was at the gate of the ravine, and I returned.

16. And the ones guarding did not know why I went, and what I was doing. And to the Jews, and to the priests, and to the important ones, and to the commandants, and to the rest of the ones doing the works until then, I did not report.

17. Then I said to them, You see  this wickedness in which we are in it, how Jerusalem is desolate, and  its gates were given to fire. Come, and let us build throughout the wall of Jerusalem! and we shall not be any longer for scorn.

18. And I reported to them the hand  of God which is good upon me, and the words of the king which he spoke to me. And they said, Let us arise and build! And [2were fortified  1their hands] for  good.

19. And [4heard 1Sanaballat 2the 3Horonite], and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab. And they laughed out loud at us, and they disdained us, and they said, What is  this thing which you are doing? or is it [3against 4the 5king 1that you are 2defecting]?

20. And I returned to them a word, and I said to them, The God  of heaven, he shall prosper the way for us. And we his servants are pure, and we shall arise and build, and to you there is no portion, nor judicial right, nor a memorial in Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 4

1.  Sanballat Opposes Building the Wall And it came to pass when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, that it was evil to him, and he was angry very much, and he was laughing out loud over the Jews.

2. And he spoke before  his brethren, and the force of the Samaritans, and he said, What  do these Judahmen do -- the Jews? Shall we not abandon them? Is it to sacrifice? Is it that they will be able to? And today, will they repair the stones with the embankment rubbish for being burnt?

3. And Tobiah the Ammonite was next to him, and he said to them, And even if they shall build, shall not [2ascend 1a fox] and demolish  [2wall 3of stones 1their]?

4. Hear, O our God! for we became for sneering. And return their scorning upon their head, and give them for sneering in a land of captivity!

5. And you should not cover over their lawlessness; and  their sin -- [2from 3your face 1may it not be wiped away]. For they provoked you to anger before the ones building.

6. And we built the wall, and [4was joined together 1all 2the 3wall] unto the half of it. And [5became 1the 2heart 3of the 4people] so as to construct.

7. And it came to pass as Sanballat heard, (and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, that [6ascended 1the 2development 3of the 4walls 5of Jerusalem],) that they began [2the 3gaps 1to block up], that [3wicked 4to them 1it appeared 2exceedingly].

8. And they gathered all together to come and to deploy against Jerusalem, and to do it for a delusion.

9. And we prayed to  our God, and we set an advance guard against them day and night, in front of them.

10. And Judah said, [5is broken 1The 2strength 3of the 4enemies], and the dust is vast, and we shall not be able to build on the wall.

11. And [4said 1the 2ones afflicting 3us], They shall not know, and they shall not see until whenever we should come into the midst of them, and should murder them, and should cause [3to cease 1the 2work]. 

12.  The Jews Build while Defending Themselves And it came to pass as [6came 1the 2Jews  3living 4next to 5them], that they said to us, They ascend from out of all the places that you returned from us.

13. And I stood men in the lowermost  place from behind the wall, in the protected places. And I stood the people according to peoples, with their broadswords, and  their wooden spears, and their bows.

14. And I beheld, and I rose up, and I spoke to the important ones, and to the commandants, and to the rest of the people, saying, You should not fear from their face. You should remember  [5God 1our  2great 3and 4fearful], and deploy for  your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your residences!

15. And it came to pass when [2heard  1our enemies] that it was made known to us, that [2effaced  1God]  their counsel, that [2returned 1we all] to the wall, every man to  his work.

16. And it came to pass from  that day, that half of the ones being arrayed did the work, and half of them resisted with lances, and shields, and bows, and chest plates; and the rulers were behind the whole house of Judah.

17. The ones building on the wall, and the ones lifting things on their shoulders, [4armed 5in 6one 7hand 1did 2his  3work], and with one hand held the arrow.

18. And the builders -- a man had his broadsword tied upon  his loin, and they built. And the one trumpeting by the horn was next to me.

19. And I said to the important ones, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is spacious and vast, and we are dispersed upon the wall, [2far 1with each man] from  his brother.

20. In the place where ever you should hear the sound of the horn, gather together there to us, and  our God shall wage war for us.

21. And we were doing the work, and the half of us were holding the lances from the ascending of the dawn until the coming out of the stars.

22. And in  that time I said to the people, Each one with  his young one shall lodge in the midst of Jerusalem, and let [2be 3to us 4in the 5night 1an advance guard], and let the day be for work!

23. And I was there, and  my brethren, and the young men, and the men of the advance guard were behind me; and there was not of us [2being stripped 1a man]  of his own garments; a man and his weapons into the water.  

## Nehemiah 5

1.  The Jews Quarrel Over Servitude And [7was 1the 2cry 3of the 4people 5and 6their wives] great against  their brethren of the Jews.

2. And there were some saying, With our sons and with our daughters we are many; and we shall take grain, and shall eat and shall live.

3. And there are some saying, Our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses we mortgaged, and we shall take grain and we shall eat.

4. And there are some saying, We borrowed money for tribute of the king of our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses.

5. And now [2is as 3the flesh 4of our brethren 1our flesh]; as their sons our sons; and behold, we are tyrannizing over  our sons and  our daughters selling them for servants, and there are some of our daughters being tyrannized already; and there is no power to redeem them by our hands, for our fields and our vineyards belong to the important ones.

6. And I fretted very much as I heard  their cry and  these words.

7. And [2took counsel 1my heart] with me, and I did combat against the important ones, and the rulers. And I said to them, Shall [2exact 1a man]  from his brother what you do? And I put upon them [2assembly 1a great].

8. And I said to them, We have acquired  our brethren of the Jews, of the ones having been sold to the nations, by our voluntary offerings; and do you sell  your brethren? Or shall they be sold to us? And they were quiet, and they did not find a word.

9. And I said, [3is not good 1The 2matter] which you do. [2not 4thus 5in 6the fear 7of our God 1Should you 3go forth] because of the scorn of the nations  of our enemies?

10. And also I, and  my brethren, and  my acquaintances, put up for them money and grain; we abandoned indeed  this exaction.

11. Return indeed to them, even today, their fields, and their vineyards, and their olive groves, and their houses, and of the money for the grain, and [3the 4wine 5and 6the 7olive oil 1bring forth 2to them]!

12. And they said, We will give it back, and [3from 4them 1we will not 2seek], we shall do thus as you say. And I called the priests, and bound them by an oath to do as  this saying.

13. And  [2my wrap 1I shook off], and said, Thus shall [2shake off  1God] every man who does not stand by  this word, of  his house, and of his toil; and he will be thus shaken and empty. And [4said 1all 2the 3assembly], Amen. And they praised the lord. And [3did 1the 2people]  this thing.

14. And also from the day which he gave charge to me to be as their ruler in the land of Judah, from [2year 1the twentieth], and until [4year 1the thirtieth 2and 3second]  of Artaxerxes the king, [2years 1twelve], that even I and  my brethren [3bread  4of my governing 1did not 2eat].

15. But the rulers, the ones before me, oppressed upon the people, and took from them in bread loaves and in wine; and last money [2shekels 1of forty]. And also  their servants dominated over the people. But I did not do so because of the countenance of the fear of the lord.

16. And in the work of the wall [2these things 1I repaired]. [3fields of land 1I did not 2acquire], and  my servants and all the ones gathering were there for  work.

17. And the Jews, and the rulers were a hundred fifty men, and the ones coming to us from the nations  round about us were at my table.

18. And there was coming in [2day 1one] -- [2calf 1one], and [3sheep 1six 2choice], and a winter yearling; there came to me also in the midst of ten days  all wine  in multitude. And with these [3bread  4of my governing 1I did not 2seek], for [3was heavy 1the 2slavery] upon  this people.

19. Remember me, O God! for all good as much as I did  to this people.  

## Nehemiah 6

1.  Sanballat Attempts to Deceive Nehemiah And it came to pass as Sanballat heard, and  Tobiah, and  Geshem the Arabian, and the rest  of our enemies, that I built the wall, that there was no [2left 3in 4it 1breach]; (and indeed until  that time [3the doors 1I did not 2set up] in the gates)

2. that [4sent 1Sanballat 2and 3Geshem] to me, saying, Come, for we should come together in the towns in the plain of Ono! But they were considering [3against me 1to do 2harm].

3. And I sent [2unto 3them 1messengers], saying, The work is great that I do, and I am not able to go down, lest at any time [3should rest 1the 2work]; when ever I shall perfect it, I shall go down to you.

4. And they sent to me as  this saying four returns; and I sent to them according to  this word.

5. And [2sent 3to 4me 1Sanballat] according to  this word the fifth time by his servant, and a letter being open was in his hand.

6. And was written on it, Among the nations it was heard, and Geshem said that you and the Jews are considering to defect. On account of this you are building the wall, and you should be to them for king.

7. And to these things [3prophets 1you established 2to yourself] to proclaim for you in Jerusalem, saying that you reigned in Judea. And now [2will be reported 3to the 4king  1these words]. And now come we should consult together.

8. And I sent to him, saying, It happened not as  these words which you say, for [3from 4the heart 1you 2lie] about them.

9. For all were throwing us into fear, saying, [2shall be made faint  1Their hands] from  this work, and it shall not be done. And now I strengthened  my hands.

10. And I entered into the house of Shemaiah son of Dalaiah, son of Mehetabeel, and he was constrained; and he said, We should gather together in the house  of God, in the midst of it, and we should lock  its doors, for they are coming by night to murder you.

11. And I said, Who is the man such as I that shall flee? Or who such as I shall enter into the house and shall live?

12. I shall not enter. And I realized, and behold,  God did not send him, for the prophesy was a word against me. And Tobiah and Sanballat hired him,

13. so that I should fear, and should do thus, and should sin, and that I should become to them for [2name 1a bad], so as to berate me.

14. Remember, O my God,  Tobiah and  Sanballat! according to  [2their actions 1these], and  Noadiah the prophet, and to the rest of the prophets who were throwing me into fear. 

15.  The Wall of Jerusalem Finished And [3was finished 1the 2wall] the fifth and twentieth of the [2Elul 1month], in fifty two days.

16. And it came to pass when [3heard 1all  2our enemies], that [6feared 1all 2the 3nations  4round about 5us], and [4fell upon 3fear 2great 1an exceedingly]  their eyes. And they knew that by  God [3of ours 4was 5perfected  2work 1this].

17. And in  those days [3from 4many 5important men 6of Judah 1letters 2went] to Tobiah, and those of Tobiah came to them.

18. For many in Judah [2bound by an oath 1were] to him, for [2son-in-law 1he was]  of Shechaniah son of Arah. And Johanan his son took the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah for wife.

19. And indeed the things being advantageous to him he spoke before me; and [3my words 1they were 2bringing] to him. And [3letters 2sent 1Tobiah] to throw me into fear.  

## Nehemiah 7

1.  Nehemiah Sets Jerusalem in Order And it came to pass when [3was built 1the 2wall], and I set the doors, and numbered out the gatekeepers, and the singers, and the Levites,

2. and gave charge to Hanani  my brother, and to Hananiah the ruler of the palace in Jerusalem, (for he was as [2man 1a true], and one fearing  God more than many,)

3. that I said to them, [3shall not 4be opened 1The gates 2of Jerusalem] until at the same time the sun rises; and while they are still vigilant let [3be locked 1the 2doors] and be safeguarded! And you set advance guards of ones living in Jerusalem, every man at his own post, and every man before his own house!

4. And the city was spacious and great, and the people were few in it, and there were no houses having been built.

5. And [2put it  1God] into  my heart, and I gathered the important ones, and the rulers, and the people into groups. And I found a scroll of the group, to the ones which ascended at first, and I found things being written in it. 

6.  The Sons of the Captivity These are the sons of the place, the ones ascending from the captivity of the resettlement of whom [5resettled 1Nebuchadnezzar 2the 3king 4of Babylon], and they returned to Jerusalem, and to Judah, every man to his own city;

## Nehemiah 8

1.  Ezra Reads the Scroll of the Law And [4arrived  3month 1the 2seventh], and the sons of Israel were in their cities. And [4gathered together 1all 2the 3people] as [2man 1one] into the wide place  in front of [3gate 1the 2water]. And they told  Ezra the scribe to bring the scroll of the law of Moses, which the lord gave charge to  Israel.

2. And [4brought 1Ezra 2the 3priest] the law before the assembly, from man unto woman, and all the ones perceiving to hear, on day one of the [2month  1seventh].

3. And he read in it before the square of the one before the gate of the waters, from the hour of the illuminating by the sun until the middle of the day, before men and women. And they were perceiving, even all the ears of the people, to the scroll of the law.

4. And [4stood 1Ezra 2the 3scribe] upon [2rostrum 1the wooden], the one he made for  delivering a public address. And stood next to him, Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah at his right. And at the left, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, and Zechariah, and Meshullam.

5. And Ezra opened the scroll before all the people, for he was above the people. And it came to pass when he opened it, [4stood 1all 2the 3people].

6. And Ezra blessed the lord, the [2God  1great]. And [4answered 1all 2the 3people], and said, Amen, amen, lifting up  their hands; and they bowed and did obeisance to the lord with their face upon the ground.

7. And Joshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah,  Jamin, and Akkub,  Shabbethai, and Hodijah, and Maaseiah, and Kelita, and Azariah, and Jozabad and Hanan, and Pelaiah, and the Levites, were bringing understanding to the people in the law. And the people were at  their station.

8. And they read in the scroll  of the law  of God; and Ezra taught and gave orders in a higher knowledge of the lord, and [3perceived 1the 2people] in the reading. 

9.  Understanding Brought to the People And Nehemiah spoke, who is the Artasastha, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites, the ones bringing understanding to the people. And they said to all the people, [3day 2a holy 1It is] to the lord our God, do not mourn nor weep! for [4wept 1all 2the 3people] as they heard the words of the law.

10. And he said to them, Go and eat fatness, and drink sweetness, and send portions to the ones not having! for [4holy 3is 1the 2day] to the lord our God. And do not faint! for the joy of the lord, this is our strength.

11. And the Levites quelled all the people, saying, Keep silent, for the day is holy, and do not fall down!

12. And [4went forth 1all 2the 3people] to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make [2gladness 1great]; for they perceived  the words which he made known to them.

13. And on the [2day  1second] [5gathered together 1the 2rulers 3of the 4families] with all the people, and the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, to attend to all the words of the law. 

14.  The Holiday of Tents And they found written in the law which the lord gave charge to Moses, that [4should dwell 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in tents in the holiday in [3month 1the 2seventh];

15. and that they should signify with trumpets in all  their cities, and in Jerusalem. And Ezra said, Go forth unto the mountain, and bring [2leaves 1olive], and leaves [2trees 1of cypress], and leaves of a myrtle tree, and leaves of palms, and leaves [2tree 1of the bushy]! to make tents according to the writing.

16. And [3went forth 1the 2people], and brought, and they made for themselves tents, each man upon  his roof, and in  their courtyards, and in the courtyards of the house  of God, and in the squares of the gate of the waters, and in the squares of the gate of Ephraim.

17. And [9made 1all 2the 3assembly 4of the 5ones returning 6from 7the 8captivity] tents, and they stayed in tents; for [4did not 5do 7from 8the days 9of Joshua 10son 11of Nun 6thus 1the 2sons 3of Israel] until  that day. And there became [2gladness 1a great] -- exceedingly much.

18. And he read in the scroll of the law  of God day by day; from the [2day  1first] until the [2day  1last]. And they observed the holiday seven days, and the [2day  1eighth] was a holiday recess, according to the distinguishing manner.  

## Nehemiah 9

1.  Israel Separates the Alien Sons And on [4day 1the twentieth 2and 3fourth]  of this month, [4gathered together 1the 2sons 3of Israel] for fasting, and with sackcloths and ashes upon their head.

2. And [4separated 1the 2sons 3of Israel] from every [2son 1alien]; and they stood and declared openly  their sins, and the lawless deeds  of their fathers.

3. And they stood in  their position, and they read in the scroll of the law of the lord their God the fourth of the day. And they were declaring openly to the lord the fourth of the day, and doing obeisance to the lord their God.

4. And [2stood 3upon 4the ascent 5of the 6Levites 1Jeshua], and the sons of Kadmiel, Secheniah son of Sherebiah, son of Chenani. And they yelled [2voice 1with a great] to the lord  their God.

5. And [3said 1the 2Levites], Jeshua and Kadmiel, Bani, Sherebiah, Hodijah Shebaniah, Pethahiah, Rise up, bless the lord our God from the eon and unto the eon! And they shall bless [3name 2glorious 1your], and shall raise it up high with all blessing and praise. 

6.  Ezra Recounts Israel's History And Ezra said, You are he, the lord alone. You made the heaven and the heaven of the heaven, and all  their positions; the earth and all as much as is in it; the seas and all the things in them. And you restore to life  all things; and to you [5do obeisance 1the 2militaries 3of the 4heavens].

7. You are, O lord, the God. You chose Abram, and you led him from the place of the Chaldeans, and placed unto him the name Abraham.

8. And you found  his heart trustworthy before you, and you ordained with him a covenant, so as to give to him the land of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Jebusites, and Girgashites, and to give it to his seed. And you established  your words, for you are just.

9. And you beheld the humiliation  of our fathers in Egypt, and  [2their cry 1you heard] at [2sea 1the red].

10. And you gave signs and miracles in Egypt to Pharaoh, and among all  his servants, and among all the people  of his land, for you knew that they extolled themselves above them; and you made for yourself a name as it is this day.

11. And [2the 3sea 1you tore up] before them, and they went in the midst of the sea in dryness; and the ones pursuing them you tossed into the bottom of the sea, as a stone in [2water 1vehement].

12. And in a column of cloud you guided them by day; and by a column of fire  at night,  to give light to them for the way in which they went by it.

13. And upon mount Sinai you went down and spoke to them from out of heaven, and you gave to them [2judgments 1right], and laws of truth, orders, and [2commandments 1good].

14. And  [3Sabbath 1your  2holy] you made known to them; commandments, and orders, and law, you gave charge to them by the hand of Moses  your servant.

15. And bread from heaven you gave to them for their provision, and water from out of the rock you brought forth for them for their thirst. And you spoke to them to enter to inherit the land into which you stretched out  your hand to give to them.

16. But they and  our fathers were prideful, and they hardened  their neck, and they did not hearken  unto your commandments.

17. And they shook their heads in dissent  to listen, and did not remember  your wonders which you performed among them. And they hardened  their neck, and they granted a sovereign to return [2to 3slavery 1them] in Egypt. But you, O God, in forgiving sins are merciful and pitying, lenient and full of mercy, and did not abandon them.

18. And still also they made for themselves [2calf 1a molten]. And they said, These are the gods, the ones leading us from Egypt. And they committed [2provocations to anger 1great].

19. And you in [3compassions 1your  2great] did not abandon them in the wilderness. The column  of cloud did not turn aside from them by day to guide them in the way; and the column  of fire  by night to give light to them in the way in which they went by it.

20. And  [3spirit 1your  2good] gave a bringing of understanding to them, and  your manna you did not withhold from their mouth, and [2water 1you gave] to them in  their thirst.

21. And forty years you nourished them in the wilderness, and [2lacked not 1they] one thing; their garments did not become old, and their sandals were not torn up.

22. And you gave them kingdoms, and [2peoples 1you divided] to them. And they inherited the land of Sihon king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king  of Bashan.

23. And  their sons you multiplied as the stars of the heaven, and brought them into the land which you spoke to their fathers,  to enter and to inherit.

24. And [2entered 1their sons] and inherited the land. And you obliterated before them the ones dwelling the land of the Canaanites, and you gave them into  their hands, even  their kings, and the peoples of the land, to do to them as was pleasing before them.

25. And they overtook [2cities 1high], and [2land 1a fertile]. And they inherited houses full of all good things, and pits for quarrying, vineyards and olive groves, and every tree of eatable things in multitude. And they ate, and were filled up, and were fattened, and indulged in [3goodness 1your  2great].

26. And they changed and revolted from you. And they tossed  your law behind their body, and  [2your prophets 1they killed], the ones testifying to them to turn them towards you. And they made [2provocations to anger 1great].

27. And you gave them into the hand of ones afflicting them, and they afflicted them. And they yelled out to you in the time of their affliction, and you [2from out of 3your heaven 1heard], and in [3compassions 1your  2great] you gave deliverers to them, and they delivered them from the hand of ones afflicting them.

28. And as they were caused to rest, they turned to act  wickedly before you. And you abandoned them into the hands of their enemies, and they ruled among them. And again they yelled out to you. And you from out of heaven listened and rescued them by [3compassions 1your 2abundant].

29. And you attested to them, to turn them to  your law. But they acted superior, and hearkened not  of your commandments. And in  your judgments they sinned, (which [2doing 3them 1a man] shall live by them;) and they gave their back unto resisting persuasion, and [2their neck 1they hardened], and they did not hearken.

30. And you were long-suffering unto them [2years 1many], and drew out patience unto them [2years 1many], and attested to them by your spirit, by the hand of your prophets. But they did not give ear, and you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the land.

31. And you, in [3compassions 1your  2abundant] did not appoint them to consummation, and you did not abandon them; for you are strong, and merciful, and pitying.

32. And now, O our God, the strong, the great, the fortified and fearsome; guarding  your covenant, and  your mercy; do not let your attention be lessened before you concerning all the trouble which found us, and  our kings, and  our rulers, and  our priests, and  our prophets, and  our fathers, and among all  your people from the days of the kings of Assyria, and until  this day!

33. For you are just concerning all the things coming upon us, for truth you acted, but we were led into sin.

34. And  our kings, and  our rulers, and  our priests, and  our fathers observed not  your law, and heeded not  your commandments, and  your testimonies which you testified to them.

35. And they in your kingdom, and in [3goodness 1your  2abundant] which you gave to them, and in the [4land  1spacious 2and 3lustrous] which you put before them, did not serve you, and they did not turn from [3practices 1their  2wicked].

36. Behold, we are today servants, and the land which you gave to our fathers, to eat the fruit of it, and the good things of it, even behold, we are servants upon it.

37. And  [3fruits 1its  2many] became to the kings which you put over us because of our sins; and [2over  3our bodies 1they exercise authority], and over our cattle as is pleasing to them, and [2in 4affliction 3great 1we are].

38. And in all these things we are ordained a trust, and we write it; and [2put a seal upon it 1our rulers] -- our Levites, our priests.

28. And [5gathered 1the 2sons 3of the 4singers] even from the place round about Jerusalem, and from the properties of the Netophathi.

29. And in Beth-gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for [5nearby properties 3built 4for themselves 1the 2singers] surrounding Jerusalem.

30. And [6cleansed themselves 1the 2priests 3and 4the 5Levites], and they cleansed the people, and the gates, and the wall.

31. And they brought the rulers of Judah upon the wall, and I stationed two [2for 3praise 1great companies], and they went at the right the wall of the gate of the dung.

32. And [6went 7behind 8them 1Hoshaiah 2and 3half 4of the rulers 5of Judah],

33. and Azariah, and Ezra, and Meshullam,

34. and Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah.

35. And some from the sons of the priests with trumpets; Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mathaniah son of Michaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph.

36. And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah and Hanani,  to praise by instruments in odes of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was in front of them.

37. At the gate of the spring, over by them, they ascended upon the stairways of the city of David, by ascending the wall on top of the house of David, and unto the [2gate  1water] according to the east.

38. And for praise, the second group went forth to meet them, and I was behind them. And  half of the people were above the wall, up above the tower of the furnaces, and unto the [2wall  1broad],

39. and up above the gate of Ephraim, and upon the gate, the one of Eisiana, and upon the [2gate  1fish], and by the tower of Hananeel, and from the tower  of Meah, and unto the gate of the sheep; and they stopped upon the gate of the prison.

40. And [3stood 1the 2two groups]  for praise in the house  of God, and I, and the half of the commandants with me.

41. And the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, were with trumpets;

42. and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Melchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And [3were heard 1the 2singers], and Jezrahiah the overseer.

43. And they sacrificed in  that day [2sacrifices 1great], and they were glad. For  God gladdened them [2gladness with great]; and  their wives and  their children were glad; and [5was heard 1the 2gladness 3in 4Jerusalem] from far off.

44. And they ordained in  that day men over the treasuries, for the treasures, for the first-fruits, and for the tenths,  to gather in to them from the fields of the cities portions to the priests and to the Levites; for there was gladness in Judah, and upon the priests, and the Levites, of the ones standing.

45. And they guarded the watch  of their God, and the watches of the cleansing, even the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commands of David, and Solomon his son.

46. For in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning there was a first of the singers, and a hymn and praise  to God.

47. And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, were giving portions of the singers and of the gatekeepers -- an account [2day 3by 4day 1of it]. And they sanctified them to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them to the sons of Aaron.  

## Nehemiah 13

1.  The Separation of the Intermixed People In  that day they read in the scroll of Moses into the ears of the people. And it was found written in it how that [4should not 5enter 1the Ammonite 2and 3Moabite] into the assembly of God unto the eon.

2. For they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, and they hired against them  Balaam to curse them. And [2turned  1our God] the curse into a blessing.

3. And it came to pass as they heard the law, that they separated all the intermixed in Israel.

4. And before this Eliashib the priest lived in the treasury of the house of our God, near Tobiah.

5. And he made for him [2treasury 1a great], and there they were formerly giving the sacrifice offering, and the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tenth of the grain, and of the wine, and of the olive oil, a commandment of the Levites, and of the singers, and of the gatekeepers, and the first-fruits of the priests.

6. And during all this I was not in Jerusalem. For in [4year 1the thirtieth 2and 3second]  of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king, and after the end of the days I asked things of the king.

7. And I came into Jerusalem, and I perceived  the wickedness which Eliashib did for Tobiah, to make for him a treasury in the courtyard of the house  of God.

8. And [3wicked 4to me 1it appeared 2exceedingly], and I tossed all the items of the house of Tobiah outside of the treasury.

9. And I spoke, and they cleansed the treasuries. And I returned there the vessels of the house  of God for the sacrifice offering and the frankincense.

10. And I knew that the portions of the Levites were not given them; and [2fled 1every man] unto his own field, the Levites and the singers, and ones doing the work.

11. And I quarreled with the commandants, and said, Why did it abandon the house  of God? And I gathered them, and set them at  their station.

12. And all Judah brought a tenth of the wheat and of the wine and of the olive oil into the treasuries.

13. And I gave charge unto the hand of Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites; and near their hand was Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah. For [2trustworthy 1they were considered], as it was upon them to portion out to their brethren.

14. Remember me, O God, in this! that [2should not be wiped away  1my acts of mercy], which I did in the house of the lord  my God, and in  his watches. 

15.  The Sabbath Profaned In  those days I beheld in Judah ones treading the wine vats on the Sabbath, and bringing sheaves, and loading upon the donkeys; even wine, and the grape cluster, and figs, and every burden, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I attested to them in the day of their sale.

16. For [4sold 5provision 1even 2the ones 3of Tyre], and sat by it bringing fish, and [2every item 3for sale 1selling] on the Sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

17. And I quarreled with the free men of Judah, and I said to them, What is  [3matter 1this  2wicked] which you do, and profane the day of the Sabbath?

18. Did not [3thus 2do  1your fathers], and [2brought 3upon 4them  1our God] and upon us all  these evils, even upon  this city? And you add to the anger upon Israel to profane the Sabbath.

19. And it came to pass when [2were stood 1the gates] in Jerusalem before the Sabbath, that I spoke, and they locked the gates. And I spoke so as to not open them until after the Sabbath. And [2some of  3my young men 1I stood] at the gates, so as to not lift burdens on the day of the Sabbath.

20. And [4lodged 1all 2the 3traders] and did business outside of Jerusalem once or twice.

21. And I testified to them, and I said to them, Why do you lodge before the wall? If you repeat it a second time, I will stretch out  my hand against you. From  that time they did not come on the Sabbath.

22. And I spoke to the Levites who were being cleansed, and the ones coming guarding the gates to sanctify the day of the Sabbath. For these things remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the magnitude  of your mercy!

23. And in  those days I saw the Jews who settled with wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and Moab.

24. And  their sons [2half 1were speaking] Ashdodish, and are not knowing to speak Jewish, but spoke according to the language of this people and that people.

25. And I quarreled with them, and cursed them, and I struck some of their men, and I plucked their hair, and I bound them to an oath by  God, You shall not give  your daughters to their sons, and you shall not indeed take  of their daughters for your sons, and to yourselves.

26. Did not [4thus 5sin 1Solomon 2king 3of Israel]? and among [2nations 1many] there was not a king likened to him, and [2one being loved  3by God 1he was], and [2appointed 3him  1God] as king over all Israel, and in this [4turned him aside 1the 3wives  2alien].

27. So [3with you 1should we not 2hearken] to do  this wickedness, to break contract with  our God, and to settle with [2wives 1alien]?

28. And from the sons of Joiada,  Eliashib the [2priest  1great], in-law  to Sanballat the Horonite -- even I threw him from me.

29. Remember them, O my God, for they were against the right of inheritance of the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites!

30. And I cleansed them from all alien connection, and I set the daily rotations for the priests and for the Levites, every man according to  his work;

31. even for the gift of the wood offerings in seasons, from times, and in the first produce. Remember me, O our God, for goodness!
