# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1.  The Revelation of Jesus Christ The revelation of Jesus Christ, which [2gave 3to him  1God], to show to his bondmen what must take place quickly. And he signified having sent by  his angel to his bondman John,

2. who testified the word  of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as much as indeed he saw.

3. Blessed is the one reading, and the ones hearing the words of the prophecy, and heeding the things [2in 3it 1being written]; for the time is near. 

4.  To the Seven Assemblies John, to the seven assemblies -- the ones in  Asia. Favor to you, and peace from the one being, and the one who was, and the one coming; and from the seven spirits which are before  his throne,

5. and from Jesus Christ, the [2witness  1trustworthy], the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To the one loving us, and bathing us from  our sins in  his blood,

6. and made us a kingdom, priests to God, and to the father of him; to him be the glory and the might into the eons of the eons. Amen.

7. Behold, he comes with the clouds, and [3shall see 4him 1every 2eye], even the ones which stabbed him. And [6shall lament 7over 8him 1all 2the 3tribes 4of the 5earth]. Yes, amen.

8. I am even the Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, says the Lord  God, the being one, and the one who was, and the one coming, the almighty. 

9.  John on the Island of Patmos I John,  your brother and partner in the affliction and kingdom and endurance in Christ Jesus, came to be on the island  being called Patmos, on account of the word  of God, and on account of the testimony of Jesus Christ.

10. I became in spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard [2sound 3behind 4me 1a great], as a trumpet,

11. saying, What you see, write in a scroll, and send forth to the seven assemblies, in Ephesus, and in Smyrna, and in Pergamos, and in Thyatira, and in Sardis, and in Philadelphia, and in Laodicea!

12. And there I turned to see the voice which spoke with me. And having turned I beheld seven [2lamp-stands 1golden];

13. and in the midst of the seven lamp-stands one likened to son of man, being clothed with a foot length robe, and being girded to the breasts [2belt 1with a golden].

14.  And his head and the hairs were white as [2wool 1white], as snow; and  his eyes as a flame of fire;

15. and  his feet were likened to fine brass, as in a furnace being with fire; and  his voice was as a sound [2waters 1of many];

16. and having [3in  5right 6hand 4his 2stars 1seven]; and from out of  his mouth [3broadsword 2double-edged 1a sharp] going forth; and  his appearance was as the sun shines in  its power.

17. And when I beheld him, I fell to  his feet as dead. And he placed  his right hand upon me, saying, Do not fear! I am the first and the last;

18. and the living one, and I became dead, and behold I am living into the eons of the eons. Amen. And I have the keys  of death and  of Hades.

19. Write then the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which are about to take place after these things!

20. The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon  my right, and the seven [2lamp-stands  1golden]. The seven stars [2angels 3of the 4seven 5assemblies 1are]. And the seven lamp-stands which you saw [2seven 3assemblies 1are].  

## Revelation 2

1.  To the Assembly at Ephesus To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write! Thus says the one holding the seven stars in  his right hand, the one walking in the midst of the seven [2lamp stands  1golden].

2. I know  your works, and  your toil, and  your endurance, and that you are not able to bear evil ones; and you tested the ones calling themselves apostles, and are not, and found them liars;

3. and you bore, and [2endurance 1have], because of  my name, and you tired not.

4. But I have against you, that the love of yours, the first, you have left.

5. Remember then from what place you have fallen, and repent, and [2the 3first 4works 1do]! But if not, I come to you quickly, and I will move  your lamp stand from out of  its place, unless you should repent.

6. But this you have, that you detest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also detest.

7. The one having an ear, hear what the spirit says to the assemblies! To the one overcoming, I will give to him to eat from the tree  of life, which is in the midst of the paradise  of my God. 

8.  To the Assemby at Smyrna And to the angel of the [2in 3Smyrna 1assembly] write! Thus says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived.

9. I know your  works, and  affliction, and  poorness, (but [2rich 1you are]) and the blasphemy of the ones calling [2to be Jews 1themselves], and are not, but a synagogue  of Satan.

10. Do not fear the things you are about to suffer! Behold indeed, [3is about 4to throw 1the 2devil] some of you in prison, that you should be tested. And you shall have affliction [2days 1ten]. Be trustworthy unto death! and I will give to you the crown  of life.

11. The one having an ear, hear what the spirit says to the assemblies! The one overcoming, in no way should be injured by the [2death  1second]. 

12.  To the Assemby at Pergamos And to the angel of the [2in 3Pergamos 1assembly] write! Thus says the one having the [3broadsword  2double-edged  1sharp].

13. I know  your works, and where you dwell, where the throne  of Satan is; and you hold  my name, and denied not the belief of me in the days in which Antipas  [3witness 1my  2trustworthy] was, who was killed among you, where  Satan dwells.

14. But I have against you a little. That you have there ones holding the teaching of Balaam, who taught  Balak to throw an obstacle before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit harlotry.

15. So have also you ones holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.

16. Repent! But if not, I come to you quickly. And I shall wage war with them by the broadsword  of my mouth.

17. The one having an ear, hear what the spirit says to the assemblies! To the one overcoming I shall give to him to eat from the manna  being hid; and I will give to him [2small stone 1a white], and upon the small stone [2name 1a new] being written, which no one knew except the one receiving. 

18.  To the Assembly of Thyatira And to the angel of the [2in 3Thyatira 1assembly] write! Thus says the son  of God, the one having  his eyes as a flame of fire, and  his feet likened to fine brass.

19. I know your  works, and the love, and the belief, and the service, and  your endurance, and  your works -- the last more than the first.

20. But I have against you, that you allow  your woman  Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and misleads  my bondmen to commit harlotry, and to eat things sacrificed to an idol.

21. And I gave to her time that she should repent; and she wanted not to repent from  her harlotry.

22. Behold, I throw her into a bed, and the ones committing adultery with her into [2affliction 1great], unless they should repent from  her works.

23. And  [2her children 1I will kill] by plague; and they shall know in all the assemblies that I am the one searching the kidneys and hearts; and I will give to you each according to  your works.

24. And to you I say, to the rest, to the ones in Thyatira, As many as have not  this teaching, and the ones who knew not the deeps  of Satan, as they say, I will not throw upon you another load.

25. Only what you have, hold until of which ever time I shall come!

26. And the one overcoming, and the one giving heed unto the end  of my works, I will give to him authority over the nations.

27. And he shall tend them with a rod of iron, as the vessels  made of clay shall be broken; as I also have received from  my father;

28. and I will give to him the [2star  1early morning].

29. The one having an ear, hear what the spirit says to the assemblies!  

## Revelation 3

1.  To the Assembly at Sardis And to the angel of the [2in 3Sardis 1assembly] write! Thus says the one having the seven spirits  of God, and the seven stars. I know your  works, that [2a name 1you have], that you live -- but you are dead.

2. Become being vigilant, and support the rest which you are about to throw off! for I have not found your  works being fulfilled before  my God.

3. Remember then how you received and heard, and give heed, and repent! If then you should not be vigilant, I will come upon you as a thief, and in no way should you know what hour I will come upon you.

4. But [2a few 1You have] names in Sardis which tainted not  their garments; and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.

5. The one overcoming, this one shall be covered with [2garments 1white]; and in no way shall I wipe away  his name from out of the book  of life, and I will acknowledge  his name before  my father, even in the presence of  his angels.

6. The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies! 

7.  To the Assembly at Philadelphia And to the angel of the [2in 3Philadelphia 1assembly] write! Thus says the holy one, the true, the one having the key  of David; the one opening, and no one locks, and locks, and no one opens.

8. I know your  works. Behold, I have put before you a door being opened, which no one is able to lock it; for [2a little 1you have] power, and you gave heed to my  word, and denied not  my name.

9. Behold, I give from out of the synagogue  of Satan of the ones saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but lie. Behold, I will make them that they shall come and do obeisance before the feet of you, and they should know that I love you;

10. for you kept the word  of my endurance, and I will keep you from the hour of the test, of the one about to come upon the [2world 1entire], to test the ones dwelling upon the earth.

11. I come quickly. Hold what you have, that no one should take  your crown!

12. The one overcoming, I will make him a column in the temple  of my God, and outside in no way should he go forth any longer. And I will write upon him the name  of my God, and the name of the city  of my God -- of the new Jerusalem, which comes down from out of the heaven from  my God, and  [3name 1my  2new].

13. The one having an ear, hear what the spirit says to the assemblies! 

14.  To the Assembly at Laodicea And to the angel of the [2in Laodicea 1assembly] write! Thus says the amen, the [4witness  1trustworthy 2and 3true], the source of the creation  of God.

15. I know your  works, that [2neither 3cold 1you are] nor boiling hot; ought [2cold 1you should be] or boiling hot.

16. Thus, because you are lukewarm, and not boiling hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you from out of  my mouth.

17. For you say that, I am rich and am enriched, and [2no 3need 1have]. And you do not know that you are the miserable, and the pitiable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

18. I advise you to buy gold from me purified by fire, that you should be rich, and [4garments 3with white 1that 2you should be covered], and [4should not 5be made manifest 1the 2shame  3of your nakedness]; and [2collyrium 1rub] upon  your eyes, that you should see!

19. I, as many as I should be fond of, I reprove and I correct. Be zealous then and repent!

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any should hear  my voice, and should open the door, even I will enter to him, and have supper with him, and he with me.

21. The one overcoming I will give to him to sit with me on  my throne, as even I overcame and sat with  my father on  his throne.

22. The one having an ear, hear what the spirit says to the assemblies!  

## Revelation 4

1.  The Throne in Heaven After these things I saw, and behold, a door being opened in the heaven. And the [2voice  1first] which I heard was as a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Ascend here! and I will show to you what must take place after these.

2. And immediately I existed in spirit. And behold, a throne was situated in the heaven, and upon the throne one sitting,

3. likened in sight [2stone 1to a jasper], and sardius; and a rainbow was round about the throne, likened to the sight of emerald.

4. And round about the throne were [2thrones 1twenty-four]; and upon the thrones I saw the twenty-four elders sitting down, being covered in [2garments 1white]; and upon  their heads [2crowns 1golden].

5. And from out of the throne went forth lightnings, and voices, and thunders. And seven lamps of fire were burning before  his throne, which are seven spirits  of God.

6. And before the throne was as a sea of glass, likened to ice. And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.

7. And the [2living creature  1first] was likened to a lion, and the second living creature was likened to a calf, and the third living creature having the face as a man, and the fourth living creature was likened [2eagle 1to a flying].

8. And four living creatures one by one of them having each [2wings 1six] round about, and from inside being full of eyes; and [3rest 2no 1they have] day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, Lord  God  almighty, the one who was, and the one being, and the one coming.

9. And whenever [3shall give 1the 2living creatures] glory, and honor, and thankfulness to the one sitting upon the throne, to the one living into the eons of the eons,

10. [4shall fall 1the 2twenty four 3elders] before the one sitting upon the throne, and shall do obeisance to the one living into the eons of the eons; and they shall cast  their crowns before the throne, saying,

11. Worthy are you the Lord and   our God, the holy one, to receive the glory, and the honor, and the power; for you created  all things, and by  your will they are and were created.  

## Revelation 5

1.  The Sealed Scroll And I saw upon the right of the one sitting upon the throne, a scroll being written on inside and outside, being sealed up [2seals 1with seven].

2. And I saw [2angel 1a strong] proclaiming [2voice 1with a great], Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loose its seals?

3. And no one was able in the heaven, nor upon the earth, nor underneath the earth, to open the scroll, nor to look at it.

4. And I wept much, for no one worthy was found to open and to read the scroll, nor to look at it.

5. And one from the elders says to me, Weep not! Behold, [3overcame 1the 2lion], the one being from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, to open the scroll, and to loose the seven seals of it. 

6.  The Lamb And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a lamb standing as being slain, having [2horns 1seven] and [2eyes 1seven]; which are the seven spirits  of God being sent into all the earth.

7. And he came, and he took from out of the right hand of the one sitting upon the throne a scroll.

8. And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell before the lamb, [2having 1each] harps, and bowls made of gold being full of incenses, which are the prayers of the holy ones.

9. And they sang [2ode 1a new], saying, Worthy are you to take the scroll, and to open  its seals; for you were slain, and you bought  us to God by  your blood, from out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.

10. And you made them [4to 5our God 1kings 2and 3priests]; and they reign upon the earth.

11. And I saw, and I heard as a sound [2angels 1of many] round about the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders; and was the number of them myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,

12. saying [2voice 1with a great], Worthy is the lamb, the one having been slain, to receive  power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.

13. And every creature which is in the heaven, and upon the earth, and underneath the earth, and [3upon 4the 5sea 1which 2are], and [2the ones 3in 4them 1all], I heard, saying, to the one sitting upon the throne, and to the lamb, The blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the might to the eons of the eons.

14. And the four living creatures saying the Amen. And the twenty four elders fell and did obeisance.  

## Revelation 6

1.  First Seal: A White Horse And I saw that [3opened 1the 2lamb] one of the seven seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as a sound of thunder, Come and see!

2. And I saw, and behold, [2horse 1a white]. And the one sitting upon it having a bow; and was given to him a crown, and he went forth overcoming, and that he should overcome. 

3.  Second Seal: A Fiery Horse And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see!

4. And went forth another horse, fiery; and to the one sitting upon it was given to him to take the peace from the earth, that [2one another 1they shall slay]; and [3was given 4to him 2sword 1a great]. 

5.  Third Seal: A Black Horse And when he opened the [2seal  1third], I heard the third living creature saying, Come and see! And I saw, and behold, [2horse 1a black]; and the one sitting upon it having a yoke balance scale in  his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A choenix of grain for a denarius, and three choenices of barley for a denarius; and the olive oil and the wine do not wrong. 

7.  Fourth Seal: A Greenish Horse And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see!

8. And I saw, and behold, [2horse 1a pale], and the one sitting upon it, his name was death, and  Hades followed after him. And was given to him authority upon the fourth of the earth to kill by broadsword, and by hunger, and by plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth. 

9.  Fifth Seal: Martyrs And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of the men, of the ones having been slain because of the word  of God, and because of the testimony of the lamb which they had.

10. And they cried out [2voice 1with a great], saying, How long, O master, the holy and the true, do you not judge and avenge  our blood of the ones dwelling upon the earth?

11. And [3were given 4to each 2robes 1white]; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet a time, until of which time they should be fulfilled -- both  their fellow-servants and  their brethren, the ones about to be killed, as also they. 

12.  Sixth Seal: Earthquake and Disturbance in the Heaven And I saw. And when he opened the [2seal  1sixth], even [2earthquake 1a great] took place, and the sun [2black 1became] as a sackcloth made of hair, and the moon became as blood;

13. and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig-tree casts  its immature figs [2by 3a great 4wind 1being shaken].

14. And the heaven had been separated as a scroll being rolled, and every mountain and island from out of  their places were shaken.

15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the commanders of thousands, and the rich, and the mighty ones, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains.

16. And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of the one sitting upon the throne, and from the anger of the lamb!

17. For is come the [2day  1great]  of his anger; and who is able to stand?  

## Revelation 7

1.  Four Angels And after this, I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that they should not blow wind upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.

2. And I saw another angel having ascended from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God. And he cried out [2voice 1with a great] to the four angels, to the ones whom it was given to them to injure the earth and the sea,

3. saying, Injure not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until  we seal the bondmen  of our God upon  their foreheads. 

4.  144,000 Sealed And I heard the numbers of the ones having been sealed -- a hundred and forty four thousand having been sealed, from out of every tribe of the sons of Israel.

5. From out of the tribe of Judah -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Reuben -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Gad -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon;

6. from out of the tribe of Asher -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Naphtali -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Manasseh -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon;

7. from out of the tribe of Simeon -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Levi -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Issachar -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon;

8. from out of the tribe Zebulun -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Joseph -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon; from out of the tribe of Benjamin -- twelve thousand having been set seal upon. 

9.  A Great Multitude from the Great Affliction After these things I saw, and behold, [2multitude 1a great] which [3to count 1no one 2was able] from out of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and languages, standing before the throne, and before the lamb, wearing [2robes 1white], and palms in  their hands.

10. And they cry out [2voice 1a great], saying,  Deliverance to our God, to the one sitting upon the throne, and to the lamb.

11. And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures. And they fell before the throne upon  their faces, and they did obeisance to  God,

12. saying, Amen; the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thankfulness, and the honor, and the power, and the strength to our God into the eons of the eons. Amen.

13. And answered one of the elders, saying to me, These  wearing the [2robes  1white], who are they, and from where came they?

14. And I said to him, O my Lord, you know. And he said to me, These are the ones coming from out of the [2affliction  1great], and they washed  their robes, and whitened them in the blood of the lamb.

15. Because of this they are before the throne  of God, and they serve to him day and night in  his temple; and the one sitting upon the throne shall encamp over them.

16. They shall not hunger any more, nor thirst any more, nor in any way shall [3fall 4upon 5them 1the 2sun], nor any sweltering heat.

17. For the lamb, the one in the midst of the throne, shall tend them. And he shall guide them unto [3of life 1springs 2of waters]. And [2will wipe away  1God] every tear from  their eyes.  

## Revelation 8

1.  Seventh Seal: Silence in Heaven And when he opened the [2seal  1seventh], there became quietness in the heaven about a half-hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels, the ones which [2before  3God 1stand], and were given to them seven trumpets.

3. And another angel came and he stood at the altar, having [2censer 1a golden]; and [3were given 4to him 2incenses 1many], that he should offer it with the prayers [2the 3holy ones 1of all] upon the [2altar  1golden], the one before the throne.

4. And [5ascended 1the 2smoke 3of the 4incenses], with the prayers of the holy ones, out of the hand of the angel, before  God.

5. And [3took 1the 2angel] the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast unto the earth; and there became sounds, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

6. And the seven angels, the ones having the seven trumpets, prepared themselves that they should trump.

7. And the first trumped, and came to pass hail and fire being mixed in blood, and was cast unto the earth; and the third of the earth was incinerated, and all [2grass 1green] was incinerated. 

8.  Second Trumpet: The Sea Struck And the second angel trumped; and it was as [3mountain 1a great 2burning] was cast into the sea; and [5became 1the 2third 3of the 4sea] blood;

9. and [8died 1the 2third 3of the 4creatures 5in 6the 7sea], the ones having lives; and the third of the ships were utterly destroyed. 

10.  Third Trumpet: Bitter Waters And the third angel trumped; and [3fell 4from out of 5the 6heaven 2star 1a great], burning as a lamp, and it fell upon the third of the rivers, and upon the springs of the waters.

11. And the name of the star is called  Absinthium; and [5became 1the 2third 3of the 4waters] into absinthium, and many of the men died because of the waters, for they were made bitter. 

12.  Fourth Trumpet: Darkness And the fourth angel trumped, and [5was struck 1the 2third 3of the 4sun], and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars; that [3should be darkened  1a third 2of them], and the day should not appear for  a third of it, and the night in like manner.

13. And I saw and heard one eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying [2voice 1with a great], Woe, woe woe, to the ones dwelling upon the earth, because of the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three angels, of the ones being about to trump.  

## Revelation 9

1.  Fifth Trumpet: Smoke and Locusts -- 1st Woe And the fifth angel trumped; and I saw a star [2from out of 3the 4heaven 1falling] unto the earth; and was given to him the key of the well of the abyss.

2. And he opened the well of the abyss, and ascended smoke from out of the well, as smoke of a furnace burning. And [6were darkened 1the 2sun 3and 4the 5air] by the smoke of the well.

3. And out of the smoke came forth locusts unto the earth; and [2was given 3to them 1authority], as [5have 6authority 1the 2scorpions 3of the 4earth].

4. And it was said to them that they should not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; except for the men only, the ones who have not the seal  of God upon  their foreheads.

5. And was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented [2months 1five]; and  their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, whenever it should smite a man.

6. And in  those days [2shall seek  1men]  death, and in no way shall they find it; and they shall desire to die, and [2shall flee 3from 4them  1death].

7. And the representations of the locusts were likened to horses being prepared for war; and upon  their heads as [2crowns 1golden], and  their faces as faces of men.

8. And they had hair as hair of women, and  their teeth [2as 3lions 1were].

9. And they had chest plates as chest plates of iron; and the sound  of their wings was as the sound [2chariots 3of horses 1of many] running to war.

10. And they have tails likened to scorpions, and stings, and in  their tails [2authority 1having]  to injure  men [2months 1five].

11. They have a king over them -- the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek [2the name 1he has]  Apollyon.

12. The [2woe  1one] went forth, behold, comes still two woes after these. 

13.  Sixth Trumpet: Four Angels at the Euphrates -- 2nd Woe And the sixth angel trumped; and I heard [2voice 1one] from the four horns of the [2altar  1golden], of the one before  God,

14. saying to the sixth angel, the one having the trumpet, Loose the four angels  being bound at the [2river  1great] Euphrates!

15. And [4were loosened 1the 2four 3angels], the ones being prepared for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they should kill the third  of men.

16. And the number of the military of the horses -- myriads of myriads; and I heard  their number.

17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and the ones sitting down upon them, having chest plates of fiery color, and of blue, and sulphurous; and the heads of the horses were as heads of lions, and out of  their mouths went forth fire, and smoke, and sulphur.

18. From  [2three 3plagues 1these] were killed the third  of men, by the fire, and by the smoke, and of the sulphur  going forth out of  their mouths.

19. For the authority of the horses [2in  3their mouth 1is] and in  their tails;  for their tails are likened to serpents, having heads; and by them they injure.

20. And the rest of the men who were not killed by  these calamities repented not from the works  of their hands, that they should not do obeisance to the demons, and the idols -- the golden, and the silver, and the brass, and the stones, and the wooden, which neither [2to see 1are able], nor to hear, nor to walk.

21. And they repented not of  their murders, nor of  their sorceries, nor of  their harlotry, nor of  their thefts.  

## Revelation 10

1.  The Strong Angel with the Small Scroll And I saw [2angel 1a strong] coming down from the heaven, wearing a cloud and the rainbow upon  his head. And  his face was as the sun, and  his feet as columns of fire.

2. And he had in  his hand a small scroll being opened. And he put  [3foot 1his  2right] upon the sea, and the left upon the land. 

3.  The Seven Thunders And he cried out [2voice 1with a great], as a lion roars. And when he cried out, [4spoke 1the 2seven 3thunders] the things of their own voices.

4. And when [4spoke 1the 2seven 3thunders], I was about to write; and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, Set a seal upon what [4spoke 1the 2seven 3thunders], and do not write these things.

5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the earth, lifted  his hand, the right one, to the heaven.

6. And he swore by an oath, by the one living into the eons of the eons, who created the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it; for delay will not any longer be;

7. but in the days of the sound of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to trump, and [4should be initiated 1the 2mystery  3of God], which good news was announced by his bondmen the prophets. 

8.  The Small Scroll Is Eaten And the voice which I heard from out of the heaven, again spoke with me, and saying, Go, take the small scroll, the one being open in the hand of the angel  standing upon the sea, and upon the land!

9. And I went forth to the angel, saying to him, Give to me the small scroll! And he says to me, Take and devour it! and it shall embitter your  belly, but in  your mouth it will be sweet as honey.

10. And I took the small scroll from out of the hand of the angel, and devoured it; and it was in  my mouth as [2honey 1sweet]; and when I ate it [2was made bitter  1my belly].

11. And he says to me, It is necessary for you again to prophesy over peoples, and over nations, and languages, and kings -- many.  

## Revelation 11

1.  The Holy City Trodden Upon And was given to me a reed measure likened to a rod. And [2stood 1the 2angel], saying, Arise and measure the temple  of God, and the altar, and the ones doing obeisance in it!

2. And the [2courtyard  1outer] of the temple put out, and do not measure it, for it was given to the nations; and [2the 4city  3holy 1they shall tread 7months 5forty 6two]! 

3.  The Two Witnesses And I will give to [2two 3witnesses 1my], and they shall prophesy [4days 1a thousand 2two hundred 3sixty] wearing sackcloths.

4. These are the two olive trees, and the two lamp-stands, the ones [2before 3the 4Lord 5of the 6earth 1standing].

5. And if anyone [3them 1wants 2to injure], fire goes forth from out of  their mouth, and it devours  their enemies. And if anyone wants [2them 1to injure], thus must he be killed.

6. These have authority to lock the heaven, that it should not [2rain 1rain] the days  of their prophecy. And [2authority 1they have] over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every calamity, as often as they should want.

7. And whenever they should finish  their witness, the beast, the one ascending from out of the abyss, will make [2with 3them 1war], and will overcome them, and kill them.

8. And  their corpses will be upon the square of the [2city  1great], which is [2called 1spiritually] Sodom and Egypt, where even  their Lord was crucified.

9. And shall see of the peoples, and tribes, and languages, and nations,  their corpses [2days 1three] and a half. And  their corpses they will not allow to be put in a tomb.

10. And the ones dwelling upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall be glad; and [2gifts 1they shall send] to one another; for these, the two prophets tormented the ones dwelling upon the earth.

11. And after three days and a half the breath of life from  God entered unto them, and they stood upon  their feet, and [2fear 1great] fell upon the ones viewing them.

12. And they heard [2voice 1a great] from out of the heaven, saying to them, Ascend here! And they ascended into the heaven in the cloud; and [2viewed 3them  1their enemies].

13. And in that  day took place [2earthquake 1a great], and the tenth of the city fell, and there were killed in the earthquake the names [3men 2thousand 1of seven]. And the rest [2thrown into fear 1became], and gave glory to the God  of heaven.

14. The [2woe  1second] departed. The [2woe  1third], behold, it comes quickly. 

15.  The Seventh Trumpet: Reign, Wrath and Judgment And the seventh angel trumped. And there were [2voices 1great] in the heaven, saying, [5is become 1The 2kingdom 3of the 4world]  of our Lord, and  of his Christ, and he shall reign into the eons of the eons.

16. And the twenty four elders, the ones [2before  3God 1sitting] upon  their thrones, fell upon  their faces, and did obeisance to  God,

17. saying, We give thanks to you, O Lord  God  almighty, the one being, and the one who was, and the one coming; that you have taken  [3power 1your  2great] and reigned.

18. And the nations were angry, and [2came  1your wrath], and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the wage to your bondmen, to the prophets, and to the holy ones, and to the ones fearing  your name, to the ones small and to the great, and to corrupt the ones corrupting the earth.

19. And [4was opened 1the 2temple  3of God] in the heaven, and [7was seen 1the 2ark 3of the 4covenant 5of the 6Lord] in  his temple. And there took place lightnings, and sounds, and thunders, and [2hail 1great].  

## Revelation 12

1.  Signs in Heaven And [2sign 1a great] appeared in the heaven; a woman wearing the sun, and the moon underneath  her feet, and upon  her head a crown [2stars 1of twelve].

2. And [2in 3the womb 1having one], she cried out travailing, and being tormented to give birth.

3. And appeared another sign in the heaven. And behold, [3dragon 1there was a great 2fiery] having [2heads 1seven], and [2horns 1ten]; and upon  his heads seven diadems.

4. And  his tail drags the third of the stars of the heaven, and he casts them to the earth. And the dragon stands before the woman  about to give birth, that whenever she should give birth  [3child 2her 1he should devour].

5. And she bore [2son 1a male] who is about to tend all the nations with a rod of iron; and [2was snatched away  1her child] to  God, and to  his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place being prepared by  God, that there she should be nourished [4days 1a thousand 2two hundred 3sixty]. 

7.  War in Heaven And there was war in the heaven;  Michael and  his angels  to wage war with the dragon, and the dragon waged war and  his angels;

8. and it did not prevail, nor was a place found for him any longer in the heaven.

9. And [4was cast out 1the 3dragon  2great], the [2serpent  1ancient], the one being called the devil and Satan; the one misleading the [2inhabitable world 1entire] was cast unto the earth, and  his angels [2with 3him 1were cast].

10. And I heard [2voice 1a great] in the heaven, saying, Now is come the deliverance, and the power, and the kingdom  of our God, and the authority  of his Christ; for [4was cast down 1the 2accuser  3of our brethren], the one accusing them before  our God day and night.

11. And they overcame him through the blood of the lamb, and through the word  of their testimony, and they loved not  their life until death. 

12.  The Devil on the Earth -- 3rd Woe Because of this be glad, O heavens, and O ones [2in 3them 1encamping]! Woe to the earth, and the sea, for [3is come down 1the 2devil] to you, having [2rage 1great], knowing that [2a short 3time 1he has].

13. And when [3saw 1the 2dragon] that he was cast to earth, he pursued the woman who gave birth to the male.

14. And were given to the woman two wings of the [2eagle  1great], that she should fly into the wilderness, to  her place, where she should be nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15. And [3shot 1the 2serpent] from out of  his mouth [4after 5the 6woman 1water 2as 3a river], that [2her 3river borne 1he should make].

16. And [3helped 1the 2earth] the woman, and [3opened 1the 2earth]  her mouth, and swallowed down the river which [3shot 1the 2dragon] from out of  its mouth.

17. And [3was provoked to anger 1the 2dragon] against the woman, and it went forth to make war with the rest  of her seed, of the ones giving heed to the commandments  of God, and having the testimony  of Jesus.  

## Revelation 13

1.  The Beast with Seven Heads And I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw from out of the sea a wild beast ascending, having [2horns 1ten] and [2heads 1seven], and upon  his horns ten diadems, and upon  his heads a name of blasphemy.

2. And the beast which I saw was likened to a leopard, and  his feet as a bear, and  his mouth as a mouth of a lion. And [3gave 4to him 1the 2dragon]  his power, and  his throne, and [2authority 1great].

3. And one of  his heads w as as having been slain to death; and the wound  of his death was cured; and there was wonder in all the earth after the beast.

4. And they did obeisance to the dragon, to the one giving the authority to the beast. And they did obeisance to the beast, saying, Who is likened to the beast? And who is mighty to wage war with it?

5. And was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy. And was given to it authority [2war 1to make] [3months 1forty 2two].

6. And he opened  his mouth for blasphemy against  God, to blaspheme  his name, and  his tent, and the ones [2in 3the 4heaven 1encamping].

7. And was given to him to make war with the holy ones, and to overcome them. And was given to him authority over every tribe, and language, and nation.

8. And they did obeisance to him, all the ones dwelling upon the earth, whose [2has not been written  1name] in the book of the life of the lamb, of the one having being slain from the founding of the world.

9. If anyone has an ear, hear!

10. If anyone has captivity, into captivity he goes; if anyone [2with 3a sword 1kills], it is a must for him [2by 3a sword 1to be killed]. Here is the endurance, and the belief of the holy ones. 

11.  The Beast with Two Horns And I saw another beast ascending from out of the earth, and he had [2horns 1two] likened to a lamb; and he spoke as a dragon.

12. And [2the 3authority 4of the 5first 6beast 1he executes all] before him, and caused the earth, and the ones [2in 3it 1dwelling], that they should do obeisance to the [2beast  1first], of whom was cured  [2wound  3of death 1of his].

13. And he works [2signs 1great] and fire, that from out of the heaven it should come down upon the earth before  men. 

14.  The Image to the Beast And he misleads the ones of mine, of the ones dwelling upon the earth, by the signs which were given to him to do before the beast, saying to the ones dwelling upon the earth to make an image to the beast which had the wound of the sword, and lived.

15. And was given to him breath to give to the image of the beast, that also [5should speak 1the 2image 3of the 4beast], and should cause as many as would not do obeisance to the image of the beast, that they should be killed.

16. And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bondmen, that there should be given to them an imprint upon  [3hand 1their  2right], or upon  [2foreheads 1their].

17. And that no one should be able to buy or sell, except the one having the imprint, or the name of the beast, or the number  of his name.

18. Here  is wisdom. The one having the mind tally the number of the beast; [3a number 1for 4of a man 2it is], and  his number is 600 60 6  

## Revelation 14

1.  144,000 And I saw, and behold, a lamb standing upon  mount Zion, and with him a hundred forty four thousand, having  his name and the name  of his father being written upon  their foreheads.

2. And I heard a sound from out of the heaven, as a sound [2waters 1of many], and as a sound [2thunder 1of great]; and  [2the sound 3which 1I heard] was as harpists harping with  their harps.

3. And they sing [2ode 1a new] before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders. And no one is able to learn the ode, except the hundred forty four thousand, the ones being bought from the earth.

4. These are the ones [3with 4women 1not 2tainted]; [3virgins 1for 2they are]. These are the ones following the lamb where ever he should go. These [2by 3Jesus 1were bought] from  men as first-fruit  to God, and to the lamb.

5. And in  their mouth was not found a lie, [3unblemished 1for 2they are]. 

6.  Judgment on Those Who Receive the Imprint And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven having [2good news 1eternal] to announce good news for the ones being settled upon the earth, and unto every nation, and tribe, and language, and people,

7. saying with [2voice 1a great], Fear  God, and give to him glory! for [4came 1the 2hour  3of his judgment]; and do obeisance to the one having made the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and springs of waters!

8. And another angel, a second followed, saying, Is fallen, is fallen, Babylon the great; because [6of the 7wine 8of the 9wrath  10of her harlotry 1she has given 5to drink 2all 3the 4nations].

9. And another angel, a third followed them, saying with [2voice 1a great], If any does obeisance to the beast and  its image, and receives an imprint upon  his forehead or upon  his hand;

10. even he shall drink of the wine of the rage  of God, the one being mixed undiluted in the cup  of his wrath; and he shall be tormented by fire and sulphur before the holy angels, and before the lamb.

11. And the smoke  of their torment [2into 3the eons 4of eons 1ascends]; and they have not rest day and night, the ones doing obeisance to the beast and  his image, and if anyone takes the imprint  of its name.

12. Here [2the 3endurance 4of the 5holy ones 1is]. Here are the ones keeping the commandments  of God, and the belief, of the one of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from out of the heaven saying to me, Write! Blessed are the dead, the ones [2in 3the Lord 1dying] from now on. [3says 4yes 1The 2spirit], for they shall rest from  their toils,  and their works shall follow after them. 

14.  The Angel with the Sickle And I saw, and behold, [2cloud 1a white], and upon the cloud sitting was one likened to son of man, having upon  his head [2crown 1a golden], and in  his hand [2sickle 1a sharp].

15. And another angel came forth from out of the temple, crying out with [2voice 1a great] to the one sitting upon the cloud, Send forth  your sickle and reap! for [3came 1the 2hour]  to reap, for [5is dried 1the 2harvest 3of the 4earth].

16. And [6put 1the one 2sitting 3upon 4the 5cloud]  his sickle unto the earth, and [3was reaped 1the 2earth].

17. And another angel came forth from out of the temple, of the one in the heaven, having also himself [2sickle 1a sharp].

18. And another angel came forth from the altar, having authority over the fire. And he called [2cry 1with a great] to the one having the [2sickle  1sharp], saying, Send forth your  [2sickle  1sharp], and gather the vintage of the clusters of grapes of the grapevine of the earth! for [2are ripened  1her grapes].

19. And [3put 1the 2angel]  his sickle to the earth, and gathered the vintage -- the grapevine of the earth. And he cast into the wine vat of the rage of the great God.

20. And [3was trodden 1the 2wine vat] outside the city. And came forth blood from out of the wine vat as far as the bridle of the horses, from [3stadiums 1a thousand 2six hundred].  

## Revelation 15

1.  The Angels with the Seven Calamities And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, [2angels 1seven] having [4calamities 3seven 1the 2last], for in them [4was finished 1the 2rage  3of God].

2. And I saw as [2sea 1a glass] with fire being mixed, and the ones overcoming of the beast, and of  his image, and of the number  of his name, standing upon the [2sea  1glass], having harps  of God.

3. And they sing the ode of Moses the bondman  of God, and the ode of the lamb, saying, Great and wonderful  are your works, O Lord  God  almighty; just and true  are your ways, O king of the nations.

4. Who in no way should fear you, O Lord, and glorify  your name? For [2alone 3holy 1you are]. For all the nations shall come and shall do obeisance before you, for  your ordinances were manifested.

5. And after these things I saw, and [7was opened 1the 2temple 3of the 4tent 5of the 6testimony] in the heaven.

6. And came forth the seven angels, the ones having the seven calamities, the ones who were being clothed in [4flax 1clean 2and 3bright], and being girded around the breasts [2belts 1by golden].

7. And one from the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven [2bowls 1golden] being full of the rage  of God, of the one living into the eons of the eons.

8. And [3was filled 1the 2temple] of smoke from the glory  of God, and from  his power; and no one was able to enter into the temple until [7were finished 1the 2seven 3calamities 4of the 5seven 6angels].  

## Revelation 16

1.  First Bowl: Sores And I heard [2voice 1a great] from out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go pour out the bowls of the rage  of God unto the earth!

2. And went forth the first, and he poured out  his bowl upon the earth, and there became [4sore 1a hurtful 2and 3severe] to the men, the ones having the imprint of the beast, and the ones doing obeisance to his image.

3. And the second angel poured out  his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as if of a dead one; and every [2soul 1living] died in the sea. 

4.  Third Bowl: Rivers Become Blood And the third angel poured out  his bowl into the rivers and the springs of the waters, and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous are you, the being one, and the one who was, the sacred one, that [2these things 1you judged].

6. For the blood of holy ones and prophets they poured out, and [2them blood 1you gave] to drink, [2worthy 1they are].

7. And I heard from the altar, saying, Yes, O lord  God the almighty, true and just are your judgments. 

8.  Fourth Bowl: Men Scorched And the fourth angel poured out  his bowl upon the sun, and was given to him to scorch the men by fire.

9. And [3were scorched 1the 2men 5sweltering heat 4with a great], and [3blasphemed 1the 2men] the name  of God, of the one having the authority over  these calamities; and they repented not to give to him glory. 

10.  Fifth Bowl: Darkness and Pain And the fifth angel poured out  his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and [2became  1his kingdom] enveloped in darkness; and they gnawed  their tongues because of the misery;

11. and they blasphemed the God  of heaven because of  their miseries, and because of  their sores, and they repented not of  their works. 

12.  Sixth Bowl: The Euphrates Dries Up And the sixth angel poured out  his bowl upon the [2river  1great]  Euphrates, and [2was dried up  1its water], that [5should be prepared 1the 2way 3of the 4kings], the ones from the risings of the sun.

13. And I saw from out of the mouth of the dragon, and from out of the mouth of the beast, and from out of the mouth of the false prophet, [3spirits 1three 2unclean] as frogs.

14. For they are spirits of daimons, doing signs which go forth unto the kings of the [2inhabitable world 1entire], to gather them together for battle  [3day 1of that  2great]  of God  almighty.

15. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is the one being vigilant and keeping  his garments, that [2not 4naked 1he should 3walk], and they shall see  his indecency.

16. And he gathered them together to the place  being called in Hebrew, Armageddon. 

17.  Seventh Bowl: Earthquake And the seventh angel poured out  his bowl into the air; and came forth [2voice 1a great] from the temple of the heaven, from the throne, saying, It has taken place.

18. And there were lightnings, and thunders, and sounds; and [2earthquake 3took place 1a great], such as has not taken place from which time the men were upon the earth, with such an earthquake so great.

19. And [4became 1the 3city  2great] into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the great was remembered before  God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the rage  of his wrath.

20. And every island fled, and no mountains were found.

21. And [2hail 1great] as a talent weight descends out of the heaven upon the men. And [3blasphemed 1the 2men]  God because of the calamity of the hail, for [4great 2is  1its calamity 3exceedingly].  

## Revelation 17

1.  The Great Harlot And came one of the seven angels of the ones having the seven bowls, and he spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show to you the judgment of the [2harlot  1great], the one sitting upon the [2waters  1many],

2. with whom [5committed harlotry 1the 2kings 3of the 4earth], and [5were intoxicated 1the ones 2dwelling on 3the 4earth] of the wine  of her harlotry.

3. And he carried me away into the wilderness in spirit. And I saw a woman sitting upon [2beast 1a scarlet], being full of names of blasphemy, having [2heads 1seven] and [2horns 1ten].

4. And the woman was wearing purple and scarlet, gilded with gold, and [2stone 1precious] and pearls, having a golden cup in  her hand full of abominations and the uncleanlinesses  of her harlotry.

5. And upon  her forehead a name being written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth.

6. And I saw the woman being intoxicated of the blood of the holy ones, and of the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled, having seen her, [2wonder 1with great].

7. And [3said 4to me 1the 2angel], Why did you marvel? I will tell to you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast, of the one bearing her, of the one having the seven heads and the ten horns;

8. even the beast which you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend from out of the abyss, and [2into 3destruction 1to go away]. And [6shall marvel 1the ones 2dwelling 3upon 4the 5earth], whose [2are not 3written  1names] upon the scroll of the life from the founding of the world, seeing the beast that was, and is not, and shall be at hand.

9. Here is the mind of the one having wisdom. The seven heads [2seven 3mountains 1are] where the woman sits upon them.

10. And [3kings 2seven 1there are] -- the five fallen, the one is, the other not yet is come; and whenever he should come, [4a little 1he 2must 3remain].

11. And the beast which was, and is not, even he is eighth, and [2from out of 3the 4seven 1he is], and [2unto 3destruction 1he goes].

12. And the ten horns which you saw [2ten 3kings 1are], ones which [3a kingdom 1not yet 2received], but [2authority 3as 4kings 5one 6hour 1receive] with the beast.

13. These [2one 3opinion 1have], and [2the 3power 4and  5their authority 6to the 7beast 1they give]. 

14.  The Lamb These [2against 3the 4lamb 1shall wage war], and the lamb will overcome them, for [2Lord 3of lords 1he is] and king of kings; and the ones with him are called, and chosen, and trustworthy.

15. And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, [2peoples 3and 4multitudes 1are], and nations, and languages.

16. And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall detest the harlot, and [3being made desolate 1they shall cause 2her], and [3naked 1shall make 2her], and  [2her flesh 1shall devour], and shall incinerate her by fire.

17.  For God gave to  their hearts to do  his design, and to do [2design 1one], and to give  their kingdom to the beast, until [4shall be fulfilled 1the 2words  3of God].

18. And the woman whom you saw is the [2city  1great], the one having kingship over the kings of the earth.  

## Revelation 18

1.  Babylon is Fallen And after these things I saw another angel descending from the heaven, having [2authority 1great], and the earth was enlightened from  his glory.

2. And he cried out in strength of voice, saying, Is fallen, is fallen, Babylon the great, and is become home of daimons, and a prison of every [2spirit 1unclean], and a prison of every [4bird 1unclean 2and 3detested].

3. For of the rage of the wine  of her harlotry [4are given to drink 1all 2the 3nations]; and the kings of the earth [2with 3her 1committed harlotry]; and the merchants of the earth [2of 3the 4power  5of her indulgence 1were enriched].

4. And I heard another voice from out of the heaven, saying, Come forth from out of her,  my people! that you should not partake together with  her sins; and [4of  5her calamities 1that 2you should not 3receive].

5. For [3cleaved 1her  2sins] as far as the heaven, and [2remembered 3of her  1God]  her offences.

6. Render to her as also she rendered to you, and double up to her double according to  her works! In the cup which she mixed, you mix to her double!

7. So much as she glorified herself, and lived indulgently, so for that much you give to her torment and mourning! For in  her heart she says that, I sit a queen, and [2a widow 1I am not], and [3mourning 1in no way 2shall I see].

8. On account of this in one day shall come  her calamities -- death, and mourning, and hunger. And [2by 3fire 1she shall be incinerated], for [3is strong 1the Lord  2God], the one judging her.

9. And [5shall weep 6for her 7and 8beat their chests 9over 0her 1the 2kings 3of the 4earth], the ones [2with 3her 1committing harlotry], and living indulgently, whenever they should see the smoke  of her burning fire,

10. [2from 3far off 1standing] on account of the fear  of her torment, saying, Woe, woe to the [2city  1great], Babylon, the [2city  1strong], for in one hour [2came  1your judgment].

11. And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, for  [3their merchandise 1no one 2buys] any longer;

12. merchandise of gold, and of silver, and [2stone 1of precious], and of pearl, and of linen, and of purple goods, and of silk, and of scarlet goods, and all wood of thyine, and every item of ivory, and every item of [2wood 1most precious], and of brass, and of iron, and of marble,

13. and cinnamon, and incenses, and perfumed liquid, and frankincense, and wine, and olive oil, and fine flour, and grain, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and coaches, and bodies, and souls of men.

14. And the autumn fruits of the desire  of your soul are departed from you; and all the lustrous things, and the bright things are destroyed from you, and no longer in any way shall you find them.

15. The merchants of these things, the ones who enriched from her, [2from 3far off 1shall stand] because of the fear  of her torment, weeping and mourning,

16. and saying, Woe, woe to the [2city  1great], the one wearing fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and being gilded with gold, and [2stone 1precious], and pearls.

17. For in one hour was made desolate  so great a wealth. And every navigator, and all  upon the boats sailing, and seamen, and as many as [2the 3sea 1work 5from 6far off 4stood],

18. and crying out seeing the smoke  of her burning fire, saying, What is likened to the [2city  1great]?

19. And they threw dust upon  their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, and saying, Woe, woe the [2city  1great], in which were enriched all the ones having the ships in the sea from  her valuables, that in one hour she was made desolate.

20. Be glad over her, O heaven, and the holy ones, and the apostles, and the prophets! for [2judged  1God]  your case against her.

21. And [4lifted 1one 3angel 2strong] a stone as [2millstone 1a great], and cast it in the sea, saying, Thus with impulse shall [5be thrown 1Babylon 2the 3great 4city], and in no way shall be found any more.

22. And a sound of harpists, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, in no way shall be heard in you any more; and every craftsman of every craft in no way shall be found in you any more; and the sound of a millstone in no way shall be heard in you any more;

23. and the light of a lamp in no way shall shine in you any more; and the voice of the groom and bride in no way shall be heard in you any more. For  your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by  your sorcery [4were misled 1all 2the 3nations].

24. And in her the blood of prophets and holy ones was found, and of all the ones being slain upon the earth.  

## Revelation 19

1.  Alleluia And after these things I heard as [2sound 4multitude 3of a great 1a great] in the heaven, saying, Alleluia; the deliverance, and the power, and the glory  of our God.

2. For true and just are his judgments; for he judged the [2harlot  1great], she who corrupted the earth with  her harlotry; and he avenged the blood  of his bondmen from out of her hand.

3. And a second time they have said, Alleluia. And  her smoke ascends into the eons of the eons.

4. And [4fell 1the 3elders  2twenty-four], and the four living creatures, and they did obeisance to  God, to the one sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen; alleluia.

5. And a voice from the throne came forth, saying, Praise  our God all  his bondmen, and the ones fearing him -- the small and the great!

6. And I heard as a sound [2multitude 1of a great], and as a sound [2waters 1of great], and as a sound [2thunders 1of strong], saying, Alleluia; for [4reigns 1the Lord  2God  3almighty]. 

7.  The Wedding of the Lamb Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to him! for [5is come 1the 2wedding 3of the 4lamb], and  his wife prepared herself.

8. And it was given to her that she should wear fine linen bright and clean; for the fine linen, [2the 3right actions 1is] of the holy ones.

9. And he says to me, Write! Blessed are the ones [2to 3the 4supper 5of the 6wedding 7of the 8lamb 1being called]. And he says to me, These  words [2are true  1of God].

10. And I fell before  his feet to do obeisance to him. And he says to me, See that you do not! [2fellow-servant 1I am your], and  of your brethren  having the testimony  of Jesus; to God do obeisance! For the testimony  of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy. 

11.  A White Horse And I saw the heaven being opened, and behold, [2horse 1a white]; and the one sitting upon him being called trustworthy and true, and with righteousness he judges and wages war.

12.  And his eyes a flame of fire, and upon  his head [2diadems 1many]; having names being written, and a name being written which no one knows except himself.

13. And wearing a cloak being dipped in blood, and [2is called  1his name], The Word  of God.

14. And the militaries, the ones in the heaven followed him upon [2horses 1white], being clothed in [3fine linen 2white 1clean].

15. And from out of  his mouth goes forth [3broadsword 2double-edged 1a sharp], that with it he should strike the nations. And he shall tend them with a rod of iron. And he treads the wine vat of the wine of the rage of the wrath  of God  almighty.

16. And he has upon the cloak, and upon  his thigh, a name being written, King of kings, and Lord of lords. 

17.  War with the Beast And I saw one angel standing in the sun; and he cried out [2voice 1with a great], saying to all the birds, to the ones flying in mid-heaven, Come, and be gathered together for the [2supper  1great]  of God,

18. that you should eat flesh of kings, and flesh of commanders of thousands, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses, and of the ones sitting upon them, and flesh of all, both free and bondmen, both small and great.

19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and  their militaries being gathered together to make war with the one sitting upon the horse, and with  his military.

20. And [3was laid hold of 1the 2beast], and with this one the false prophet, the one performing the signs before him, in which he misled the ones receiving the imprint of the beast, and the ones doing obeisance to  his image. [4living 3were thrown 1The 2two] into the lake  of fire  burning with  sulphur.

21. And the rest were killed by the broadsword of the one sitting upon the horse, by the one going forth from out of  his mouth. And all the birds were filled of  their flesh.  

## Revelation 20

1.  Satan Bound a Thousand Years And I saw an angel coming down from out of the heaven having the key of the abyss, and [2chain 1a great] in  his hand.

2. And he seized the dragon, the [2serpent  1ancient], who is the devil, and  Satan, the one misleading the [2inhabitable world 1entire]. And he bound him a thousand years.

3. And he cast him into the abyss, and locked, and set a seal upon him, that he should not mislead [3any more 1the 2nations] until [4be fulfilled 1the 2thousand 3years]. And after these things it is necessary to loose him a little time. 

4.  The Thousand Year Reign And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them; and the souls of the ones hewn with an axe on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word  of God, and whoever did not do obeisance to the beast, nor to his image, and did not take the imprint upon  their forehead, and upon  their hand; and they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years.

5. And the rest of the dead did not live until [4should be fulfilled 1the 2thousand 3years]; this is the [2resurrection  1first].

6. Blessed and holy is the one having part in the [2resurrection  1first]; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests  of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. 

7.  Satan Loosed And whenever [4should be fulfilled 1the 2thousand 3years], [2shall be loosed  1Satan] from out of  his prison,

8. and shall come forth to mislead the nations, the ones in the four corners of the earth --  Gog and  Magog, to gather them together for the war, which the number is as the sand of the sea.

9. And they ascended upon the width of the earth, and encircled the camp of the holy ones, and the city  being loved. And [2came down 1fire] from the heaven from  God, and it devoured them.

10. And the devil, the one misleading them was cast into the lake  of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet are. And they shall be tormented day and night into the eons of the eons. 

11.  The Great White Throne And I saw [3throne 1a great 2white], and the one sitting upon it, from whose face [6fled 1the 2heaven 3and 4the 5earth], and no place was found for them.

12. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. And another scroll was opened, which is the one of life. And [3were judged 1the 2dead] from out of the things being written in the scrolls, according to  their works.

13. And [3gave up 1the 2sea] the ones [2in 3her 1dead]; and  death and  Hades gave up the ones of their dead. And they were judged each according to  their works.

14. And  death and  Hades were thrown into the lake  of fire. This is the [2death  1second] -- the lake  of fire.

15. And if any should not be found [2in 3the 4book  5of life 1written] he was cast into the lake  of fire.  

## Revelation 21

1.  The New Jerusalem And I saw [2heaven 1a new], and [2earth 1a new]; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away; and the sea is no more.

2. And the [2city  1holy], new Jerusalem, I saw coming down from  God out of the heaven, being prepared as a bride being adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard [2voice 1a great] from out of the heaven, saying, Behold, the tent  of God is with the men, and he shall pitch a tent with them, and they [2his people 1will be], and God himself will be with them.

4. And he shall wipe away every tear from  their eyes, and  death will not be any more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor misery -- it shall not be any more, for the first things departed.

5. And said the one sitting upon the throne, Behold, [3new 1I make 2all things]. And he says to me, Write! for these  words [2true 3and 4trustworthy 1are].

6. And he said to me, It has taken place -- the alpha and the omega, the beginning and end. I [2to the one 3thirsting 1will give] from out of the spring of the water  of life without charge.

7. The one overcoming shall inherit all, and I will be to him God, and he will be to me a son.

8. But to the timid ones, and unbelieving ones, and sinful ones, and ones being abhorrent, and murderers, and fornicators, and dealers in potions, and idolaters, and to all the liars,  their part is in the lake  burning with fire and sulphur, which is the [2death  1second]. 

9.  The Bride of the Lamb And [2came 1one] from the seven angels, of the ones having the seven bowls being full of the seven [2calamities  1last], and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show to you the wife, the bride of the lamb.

10. And he carried me away in spirit upon [4mountain 1a great 2and 3high]. And he showed to me the [2city  1great], holy Jerusalem, coming down from out of the heaven from  God,

11. having the glory  of God.  Her luminescence was likened [2stone 1to precious], as [2stone 1to jasper] sparkling;

12. having a wall great and high; having [2gatehouses 1twelve]. And upon the gatehouses [2angels 1were twelve], and names being inscribed, which is of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

13. From the east [2gatehouses 1three]; and from the north [2gatehouses 1three]; and from the south [2gatehouses 1three]; and from the west [2gatehouses 1three].

14. And the wall of the city had [2foundations 1twelve], and upon them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb.

15. And the one speaking with me had [3measure 2reed 1a golden], that he should measure the city, and  its gatehouses, and  its wall.

16. And the city [2four-cornered 1lies], and  its length is as much as the width. And he measured the city by the reed unto [3stadiums 1twelve 2thousand]. The length, and the width, and the height of her were equal.

17. And he measured  her wall a hundred forty four cubits, the measure of a man, which is, of an angel.

18. And [4was 1the 2edifice  3of her wall] jasper; and the city [2gold 1pure], likened [2glass 1to pure].

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city [2with every 4stone 3precious 1were adorned]. The [2foundation  1first] was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,

20. the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst.

21. And the twelve gatehouses were twelve pearls, whilst [2one 1each] of the gatehouses was of one pearl. And the square of the city [2gold 1is of pure] as [2glass 1transparent].

22. And [2temple 1I saw no] in her, for the Lord  God  almighty [2temple 1is her], and the lamb.

23. And the city [2no 3need 1has] of the sun, nor of the moon, that they should shine forth in her; for the glory  of God gives her light, and  her lamp is the lamb.

24. And [3shall walk 1the 2nations] by  her light; and the kings of the earth shall bring the glory and  their honor unto her.

25. And  her gatehouses in no way should be locked by day; [3night 1for 2there will be no] there.

26. And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations unto her.

27. And in no way should enter into her anything common, and committing an abomination, and a lie; only the ones being written in the scroll of the life of the lamb.  

## Revelation 22

1.  The River of Life And he showed to me [2river 1a pure] of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth from out of the throne  of God and of the lamb.

2. In the midst  of her square, and of the river, from this side here and from that side there, a tree of life producing [2fruits 1twelve], [2by 3month 1each] rendering  its fruit; and the leaves of the tree were for treatment of the nations.

3. And every great curse shall not be any longer; and the throne  of God and of the lamb [2in 3her 1will be]; and  his bondmen shall serve to him.

4. And they shall see  his face; and  his name is upon  their foreheads.

5. And [2night 1there will be no] there; and [2no need 1they have] of a lamp, and the light of the sun, for the Lord  God enlightens them; and they shall reign into the eons of the eons.

6. And he said to me, These  words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord  God of the spirits of the prophets sent  his angel to show to his bondmen what must take place quickly.

7. Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is the one giving heed to the words of the prophecy  of this scroll.

8. And I John am the one hearing and seeing these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell to do obeisance before the feet of the angel  showing to me these things.

9. And he says to me, See that you do not! [3your fellow-servant 1for 2I am], and  of your brethren the prophets, and of the ones giving heed to the words  of this scroll; to God do obeisance!

10. And he says to me, You should not set a seal upon the words of the prophecy  of this scroll, for the time is near.

11. The one wronging, let him wrong still! And the filthy one, let him be filthy still! And the righteous, [2righteousness 1let him do] still! And the holy one, let him be sanctified still!

12. Behold, I come quickly, and  my wage is with me, to render to each as  [2work 3will be 1his]. 

13.  Alpha and Omega I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and end, the first and the last.

14. Blessed are the ones observing  his commandments, that [2will be  1their authority] unto the tree  of life, and by the gatehouses they should enter into the city.

15. Outside are the dogs, and the administers of potions, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one being fond of and committing a lie.

16. I Jesus sent forth  my angel to testify to you these things unto the assemblies. I am the root and the race  of David, the [3star  1bright 2early morning].

17. And the spirit and the bride say, Come! And the one hearing let say, Come! And the one thirsting, let come! The one wanting, let take water of life without charge!

18. I bear witness to every one hearing the words of the prophecy  of this scroll; if anyone should add upon these, [2will place 3upon 4him  1God] the calamities  being written in  this scroll.

19. And if anyone should remove from the words of the scroll  of this prophecy, may God remove  his part from the tree  of life, and from the [2city  1holy] of the things having been written in  this scroll.

20. [4says 1The one 2testifying 3these things], Yes, I come quickly. Amen. Yes, come O Lord Jesus!

21. The favor  of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all the holy ones. Amen.
