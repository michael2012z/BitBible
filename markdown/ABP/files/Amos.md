## Amos 1

1.  Concerning Jerusalem The words of Amos, which took place in Kirjath Jearim of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son Joash king  of Israel, [3before 1two 2years] the earthquake.

2. And he said, The lord [2from 3Zion 1uttered a sound], and from Jerusalem he gave his voice; and [5mourned 1the 2pastures 3of the 4shepherds], and [4was dried up 1the 2top  3of Carmel]. 

3.  The Word against Damascus And the lord said, For the three impious deeds of Damascus, even for the four, I will not turn away from him. Because they sawed [2saws 1by iron] the ones [2in 3the womb 1having one] in Gilead.

4. And I will send a fire unto the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the foundations of the son of Hadad.

5. And I shall break the bars of Damascus, and I will utterly destroy the inhabitants of the plain of On; and I will cut in pieces a tribe of the men of Eden; and [4shall be captured 2people 3of Syria 1select], says the lord. 

6.  The Word against Gaza Thus says the lord, For the three impious deeds of Gaza, and for the four, I will not turn away from them. Because of  their capturing the captivity  of Solomon,  to close them up in  Edom.

7. And I will send out fire upon the walls of Gaza, and it shall devour  her foundations.

8. And I will utterly destroy the inhabitants of Ashdod, and shall lift away a tribe from Ashkelon, and I will bring  my hand upon Ekron. And [5shall be destroyed 1the 2rest 3of the 4Philistines], says the lord. 

9.  The Word against Tyre Thus says the lord, For the three impious deeds of Tyre, even for the four, I will not turn away from her. Because they closed up the captivity of Solomon in  Edom, and remembered not the covenant of brethren.

10. And I will send out fire upon the walls of Tyre, and it shall devour  her foundations. 

11.  The Word against Edom Thus says the lord, For the three impious deeds  of Edom, even for the four, I will not turn away from them. Because of  [2pursuing 3them 4with 5the broadsword  1his brother], and he laid waste the mother upon the earth, and seized by force for a testimony of his shuddering awe; and his impulse he kept unto victory.

12. And I will send forth fire against Teman, and it shall devour  her foundations. 

13.  The Word against Ammon Thus says the lord, For the three impious deeds of the sons of Ammon, even for the four, I will not turn away from them. Because they ripped open the ones [2in 3the womb 1having one] of the ones of Gilead, so that they should widen  their borders.

14. And I will light a fire even against the walls of Rabbah, and it shall devour  her foundations with a cry in the day of war, and it shall be shaken in the days of her consumption.

15. And [3shall go  2king 1their] into captivity -- the priests and  their rulers together, says the lord.  

## Amos 2

1.  The Word against Moab Thus says the lord, For the three impious deeds of Moab, even for four, I shall not turn away from it. Because they incinerated the bones of the king of Edom into powder.

2. And I will send fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the foundations of the cities. And [2shall die 3in 4powerlessness 1Moab] with a sound and with a cry of a trumpet.

3. And I will utterly destroy the judge from out of her; and all  her rulers I will kill with him, says the lord. 

4.  The Word against Judah Thus says the lord, For the three impious deeds of the sons of Judah, even for the four, I will not turn away from it; Because  of their thrusting away the law of the lord, and  his orders they kept not, and [4caused them to wander  1their vain idols 2which 3they made], the ones which [2followed  1their fathers] after them.

5. And I will send out fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the foundations of Jerusalem. 

6.  The Word against Israel Thus says the lord, For the three impious deeds of Israel, even for the four, I will not turn away from. Because they rendered silver for the just, and the needy for sandals;

7. trampling upon the dust of the earth; and they smote for the head of the poor, and the way of the humble they turned aside. And a son and his father entered to the same maidservant, so that they should profane the name  of their God.

8. And  [2their garments 1binding] with rough cords, [2canopies 1they made] next to the altar; and wine of extortions they drank in the house  of their God.

9. But I lifted away the Amorite from in front of them, as the height of cedar  in his height, and he was strong as an oak; and I removed  his fruit on top, and  his roots beneath.

10. And I led you out of the land of Egypt, and led you about in the wilderness forty years,  to inherit the land of the Amorites.

11. And I took of  your sons for prophets, and of  your young men for sanctification. [3not so 1Are 2these things], O sons of Israel, says the lord?

12. But you gave [2to drink 3for the ones 4having been sanctified 1wine]; and to the prophets you gave charge, saying, In no way prophesy!

13. On account of this, behold, I roll you underneath; in which manner [3rolls 1the 2wagon]  being full of stubble.

14. And [2shall be destroyed 1flight into exile] from the runner; and the strong in no way should hold  his strength; and the warrior in no way should deliver  his soul;

15. and the bowman in no way should stand; and the keen  of his feet in no way should be preserved; and the horseman in no way should have delivered  his life,

16. and the strong in no way shall find  his heart in might; the naked shall be pursued in that  day, says the lord.  

## Amos 3

1.  The LORD's Vengeance against Israel Hear  this word! which the lord spoke concerning you, O house  of Israel, even against every tribe of which I led from out of the land of Egypt, saying,

2. Only you I knew from out of all the tribes of the earth. On account of this I will take vengeance upon you for all  your sins.

3. Shall [2go 1two] together altogether if they do not make themselves known to each other, no.

4. Shall [2bellow 1a lion] from out of  his forest [3game 1not 2having], no. Shall [2utter 1a cub] his voice from out of  his haven altogether, if [2should not 3have been seized 1anything], no.

5. Shall [2fall 1a bird] upon the earth without a fowler, no. Shall [2be opened up 1a snare] upon the earth without  seizing anything, no.

6. Shall [2sound out loud 1the trumpet] in the city, and the people shall not be terrified, no. Shall hurt be in a city which the lord did it not, no.

7. For in no way shall [3make 1the lord  2God] a thing that he should not uncover instruction to  his servants the prophets.

8. A lion shall bellow, and who will not be fearful? The lord  God spoke, and who will not prophesy?

9. Announce it to the places among the Assyrians, and unto the places in the land of Egypt! And say, Gather together upon the mountain of Samaria, and behold [2wonders 1many] in the midst of her, and the tyranny in her!

10. And he knew not what will be before her, says the lord, the ones treasuring up injustice and misery in  their regions.

11. On account of this, thus says the lord  God, Tyre and round about  your land shall be made desolate; and he shall lead out of you  your strength, and shall tear in pieces  your regions.

12. Thus says the lord, In which manner [3should pull out 1the 2shepherd] from the mouth of the lion two legs or a lobe of an ear, so shall [4be pulled out 1the 2sons 3of Israel], the ones dwelling in Samaria before a foreign tribe, and in Damascus.

13. O priests, hear and attest to the house of Jacob! says the lord  God  almighty.

14. For in the day whenever I shall avenge the impious deeds  of Israel upon him, also I will take vengeance upon the altars of Beth-el. And [5shall be razed 1the 2horns 3of the 4altar], and shall fall upon the ground.

15. I will confound and I will strike the [2house  1turreted] upon the [2house  1harvest]; and [3shall be destroyed 2houses 1the ivory], and [4shall be added 3houses 2other 1many], says the lord.  

## Amos 4

1.  Israel Multiplies Iniquities Hear  this word, O heifers of the land of Bashan! the ones in the mountain of Samaria, the ones tyrannizing over the poor, and trampling upon the needy; the ones saying  to their masters, Give over to us so that we should drink!

2. The lord swears an oath according to  his holy things, For behold, days come upon you when they shall take you with weapons; and the ones with you [2into 3kettles 4being fired up with 1they shall put 6fires 5pestilent].

3. And you shall be brought forth naked in front of one another, and you shall be thrown onto  mount  Renmon, says the lord.

4. You entered into Beth-el, and were impious; and in Gilgal you multiplied  to be impious; and you brought in the morning of your sacrifice offerings in the third day  of your tithes.

5. And they read outside the law, and called for an acknowledgment offering. Announce! that [5these things 4loved 1the 2sons 3of Israel], says the lord.

6. And I will give to you an ache of teeth among all  your cities, and lack of bread loaves in all  your places; and you did not return to me, says the lord.

7. And I withheld from you the rain before the three months of the gathering of crops; and I shall rain upon [2city 1one], but upon [2other city 1one] I will not rain; [2portion 1one] there shall be rain, and the portion upon which I shall not rain shall be dry.

8. And [5shall be gathered together 1the inhabitants of two 2or 3three 4cities] to one city  to drink water; and in no way shall they be filled up. And you returned not to me, says the lord. 

9.  The LORD Strikes Israel I struck you with burning fire and with jaundice. You multiplied your gardens. Your vineyards, and your fig groves, and your olive groves -- [3devoured them 1the 2caterpillar]. And neither thus you returned to me, says the lord.

10. I sent to you plague in the way of Egypt. I killed [2by 3the broadsword  1your young men], with a captivity of your horses. And I led [2by 3fire  1your camps] in  your anger, and neither thus you returned to me, says the lord.

11. I eradicated you as [2eradicated  1God] Sodom and Gomorrah, and you became as a firebrand being pulled out from burning; and neither thus you returned to me, says the lord.

12. On account of this, thus I will do to you, O Israel. Furthermore that thus I will do to you, you prepare  to call upon  your God, O Israel!

13. For behold, the one stiffening thunder, and creating wind, and reporting unto men  his graciousness, producing the dawn and fog, and mounting upon the heights of the earth -- the lord  God  almighty is his name.  

## Amos 5

1.  Israel is Diminished Hear the word of the lord which I take up against you -- a lamentation! The house  of Israel fell; no longer should it proceed  to rise.

2. Virgin Israel tripped upon  its land; there is none  raising her up.

3. For thus says the lord  God, The city from out of which went a thousand, shall be left with a hundred; and from out of which went forth a hundred, shall be left ten to the house of Israel. 

4.  A Plea for Repentance For thus says the lord to the house  of Israel, Inquire of me! and you shall live.

5. And do not seek after Beth-el, and into Gilgal enter not, and by  Well of the Oath do not pass over! For Gilgal, by capturing shall be captured, and Beth-el will be as not existing.

6. Inquire of the lord, and live! so that [4should not 5blaze up 6as 7fire 1the 2house 3of Joseph], and it should devour him, and there shall not be the one extinguishing to the house of Israel.

7. The one appointing [2in 3the height 1judgment], even [2righteousness 3for 4the earth 1established];

8. The one making all things, and fashioning them differently, and turning [2into 3the morning 1the shadow], and [2day 3into 4night 1darkening]; the one calling on the water of the sea, and pouring it upon the face of the earth -- the lord  God almighty is his name.

9. The one dividing conflict into strength, and [2misery 3upon 4the fortress 1the one bringing].

10. They detested [2at 3the gates 1the one reproving], and [3word 2the sacred 1they abhorred].

11. On account of this, because they struck [2with their fist 1the poor], and [3gifts 2choice 1they took] from them; [3houses 2planed 1seeing that you built], that in no way shall you dwell in them; [3vineyards 2desirable 1you planted], but in no way should you drink  of their wine.

12. For I knew many impious deeds of yours, and [2mighty  3sins 1your] -- trampling the just, taking prices, and [2the needy 3at 4the gates 1turning aside].

13. Because of this, the one perceiving in that time shall keep silent, for the time is evil.

14. Inquire of the good, and not the wicked! so that you should live. And it will be thus -- the lord  God  almighty with you in which manner you spoke, saying,

15. We have detested the evil things, and we loved the good things. Then restore [2in 3the gates 1judgment]! so that [4should show mercy on 1the lord  2God  3almighty] the residue of Joseph.

16. On account of this, thus says the lord  God  almighty, In all squares shall be a beating of the breast, and in all ways it shall be said, Woe, woe. [2shall be called 1The farmer] unto mourning, and for beating of the breast, and for knowing wailing.

17. Even in all the ways a beating of the breast. For I shall go through your midst, said the lord. 

18.  The Day of The LORD Woe, O ones desiring the day of the lord, saying, What is this, [5to us 1the 2day 3of the 4 lord]? Even this is darkness and not light.

19. It will be in which manner if [2should flee 1a man] from the face of a lion, and [2should fall 3to him 1a bear]. And he should rush into  his house, and should fasten  his hands upon the wall, and [2should bite 3it 1a serpent].

20. Is not darkness the day of the lord, and not light? and dimness, not having brightness in it?

21. I have detested, I have thrust away your holiday feasts, and in no way shall I savor in  your festivals.

22. For if you should bring to me whole burnt-offerings and your sacrifice offerings, I will not favorably receive them. And [5deliverance offering 3the grandeur 4of your 1I will not 2look upon].

23. Remove from me the sound of your odes! and [3the psalm 4of your instruments 1I will not 2hear].

24. And [2shall roll down 3as 4water 1judgment], and righteousness as [2rushing stream 1an impassable].

25. Did [3victims for slaughter 4and 5sacrifices 1you bring near 2to me], O house of Israel, for forty years in the wilderness?

26. And you took up the tent  of Molech, and the star  of your god, Raiphan, the impressions of them which you made for yourselves.

27. And I will displace you beyond Damascus, says the lord.  God almighty is the name to him.  

## Amos 6

1.  Woe to Israel Woe to the ones treating Zion with contempt, and to the ones yielding upon the mountain of Samaria; they harvested the heads of nations, and [3entered 4themselves, 1the house  2of Israel].

2. Pass over all and behold, and go through from there into Hamath Rabba! And go down to Gath of the Philistines! [2the 3most excellent 4out of  5these kingdoms 1Are you]? [4greater than  5their borders 1Are  2your 3borders]?

3. The ones coming unto [2day 1an evil]; the ones approaching and attaching to [2Sabbaths 1false];

4. the ones sleeping upon beds of ivory, and living wastefully upon  their strewn beds, and eating kids of the flocks, and young calves of the midst of the herds -- sucklings;

5. the ones clapping along with the sound  of instruments; (as being established they considered them, and not as fleeting;)

6. the ones drinking  [2being strained 1wine], and [2with the 3foremost 4perfumes 1anointing themselves], and they suffered not anything over the destruction  of Joseph.

7. On account of this, now they will be captives by a company of mighty ones; and there shall be lifted away the snorting of horses from Ephraim.

8. For the lord swore an oath according to himself, saying, Because I abhor every  insult of Jacob, and  [2his places 1I have detested], that I will lift away his city with all the ones in her.

9. And it will be if there should be left behind ten men in [2house 1one], even they shall die.

10. And [2shall be left behind  1their family members], and they should press  to bring forth  their bones from out of the house; and one shall say to the ones set over the house, Is there still any existing with you? And he shall say, No longer, and the other shall say, Quiet, so as to not name the name of the lord.

11. For behold, the lord gives charge, and he shall strike the [2house  1great] with fractures, and the [2house  1small] with torn pieces.

12. Shall [2pursue 3in 4the rocks 1horses], no. shall they remain silent around females, no. For you distorted [2into 3rage 1judgment], and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness;

13. the ones being glad over no [2word 1good]; the ones saying, Was it not in  our strength we had horns?

14. For behold, I will rouse against you, O house  of Israel, a nation. And they shall squeeze you  to not enter into Hamath, and unto the rushing stream of the west.  

## Amos 7

1.  Locust, Fire, and Adamant Thus [3showed 4to me 1the lord  2God]; and behold, a breed of locusts coming in early morning, and behold [2grasshopper 1one] -- Gog the king.

2. And it shall be when [7should be completed 1the 2devouring 3the 4grass 5of the 6land], that I said, O lord, [2kind 1be]! Who shall raise up  Jacob, for he is very few?

3. Change your mind, O lord, over this! And this shall not be, says the lord.

4. Thus [2showed 3to me 1the lord]. And behold [2called  3punishment 4by 5fire 1the lord], and it devoured the [2abyss  1great], and it devoured the portion.

5. And I said, O lord  God, abate indeed! Who shall raise up  Jacob, for he is very few? Change your mind, O lord, over this!

6. And this in no way should be, says the lord.

7. So [2showed 3to me 1the lord]. And behold, the Lord was standing upon a wall of adamantine, and in  his hand adamant.

8. And the lord said to me, What do you see, Amos? And I said, Adamant. And the Lord said to me, Behold, I arrange an adamant in the midst of my people Israel; no longer shall I proceed  to go by it.

9. And [3shall be obliterated 1the shrines  2of laughter]; and the sites of the mystic rites  of Israel shall be made desolate. And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a broadsword.

10. And [4sent out 1Amaziah 2the 3priest] of Beth-el to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, [3a confederacy 2makes 4against 5you 1Amos] in the midst of the house of Israel. In no way will [3be able 1the 2land] to endure all  his words.

11. For thus says Amos, By the broadsword Jeroboam shall come to an end,  and Israel [2captive 1shall be led] from  his land.

12. And Amaziah said to Amos, the one seeing, Proceed! Withdraw into the land of Judah, and there spend your life! and there you shall prophesy.

13. But in Beth-el no longer shall you proceed  to prophesy. For [2a sanctuary 3for the king 1it is], and [2a house 3of royalty 1it is].

14. And Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was not a prophet, nor a son of a prophet; but I was a herder, one plucking fruit of the mulberry-tree.

15. And [2took 3me 1the lord] from the sheep, and the lord said to me, Proceed and prophesy over  my people Israel!

16. And now, hear the word of the lord! You say, Prophesy not over  Israel! for in no way should you lead a mob against the house of Jacob.

17. On account of this, thus says the lord,  Your wife [2in 3the 4city 1shall commit harlotry]; and your sons and  your daughters [2by 3the broadsword 1shall fall]; and  your land [2by 3a measuring line 1shall be measured out]; and you [2in 4land 3an unclean 1shall come to an end]; and Israel [2captive 1shall be led] from  his land.  

## Amos 8

1.  The Container of a Fowler Thus [2showed 3to me 1the lord]. And behold, a container of a fowler.

2. And the lord said, What do you see, Amos? And I said, A container of a fowler. And the lord said to me, [3is come 1The 2end] for  my people  Israel; I shall not proceed any longer  to pass by them.

3. And [5shall shriek 1the 2fretworks 3of the 4temple] in that  day, says the lord. And there shall be many  falling; in every place I will cast a silence.

4. Hear indeed these things! O ones obliterating the needy, and tyrannizing the poor of the land.

5. Saying, When shall [3go by 1the 2month] that we shall make trade, and the Sabbaths, that we shall open the treasury  to make the measure small, and  to unequally magnify the scale-weight, and to make the yoke balance scale unjust?

6. That we may acquire [2by 3silver 1the poor], and the needy in return for sandals; and of every business we shall trade.

7. The lord swears an oath according to the pride of Jacob, Shall there be forgotten for victory any  of their works, no.

8. And concerning these things, [4not 1shall 5be disturbed 2the 3land], and [6mourn 1all 2the ones 3dwelling 4in 5it]? And [3shall ascend 4as 5a river 1the 2consumption], and shall go down as the river of Egypt.

9. And it will be in  that day, says the lord, [3shall go down 1the 2sun] at midday, and [3shall darken 4upon 5the 6earth 7during 8the day 1the 2light];

10. and I will convert  your holiday feasts into mourning, and all your songs into wailing. And I will bring upon every loin, sackcloth; and upon every head, baldness. And I will appoint him as one mourning a beloved one; and the ones with him as a day of grief. 

11.  A Famine of the Word Behold days come, says the lord, and I will send out famine upon the land; not a famine of bread loaves, nor famine of water, but a famine  to hear the word of the lord.

12. And [2shall shake 1waters] from the sea unto sea. And from north unto east ones shall run about seeking the word of the lord, and in no way should they find.

13. In  that day [7will dissipate 1the 3virgins  2fair 4and 5the 6young men] by thirst.

14. The ones swearing an oath according to the atonement of Samaria, and ones saying, [2lives  1Your God], O Dan; and  your God, O Beer-sheba. And they shall fall and in no way should they rise up again.  

## Amos 9

1.  The Earth Shaken I saw the lord standing at the altar. And he said, Strike upon the atonement-seat! and [3shall be shaken 1the 2gateways]. And cut unto the heads of all! and the ones remaining of them [2by 3the broadsword 1I will kill]. In no way should one evade from them by fleeing, and in no way shall there be preserved one of them by rescuing.

2. If they should be buried in Hades, from there  my hand shall pull them up. And if they ascend into the heaven, from there I will lead them down.

3. If they hide in the top  of Carmel, from there I will search out and take them. And if they descend from out of my eyes into the depths of the sea, there I will give charge to the dragon, and it will bite them.

4. And if they go into captivity in front  of their enemies, there I will give charge to the broadsword, and it shall kill them. And I will firmly fix  my eyes against them for bad, and not for good.

5. And the lord  God  almighty, is the one attaching the earth and shaking it. And [5shall mourn 1all 2the ones 3dwelling 4it]. And it shall ascend as the river of Egypt.

6. The one building [2into 3the 4heaven 1his ascent]. and the one [2his promise 3upon 4the 5earth 1founding], the one calling on the water of the sea, and pouring it upon the face of the earth -- the lord is his name.

7. [2not 3as 4sons 5of Ethiopians 1Are you] to me, O sons of Israel, says the lord? Did I not  lead Israel from out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians from out of the pit?

8. Behold the eyes of the lord  God are upon the kingdom of the sinners, and I will lift it from the face of the earth; only that not unto completion will I remove the house of Jacob, says the lord.

9. For behold, I give charge, and I shall winnow among all the nations the house of Israel, in which manner grain is winnowed by the winnowing shovel; and in no way shall there fall a broken piece upon the earth.

10. By broadsword [5shall come to an end 1all 2the 3sinners  4of my people], the ones saying, In no way shall approach nor come upon us the evils. 

11.  The LORD Rebuilds In  that day I will raise up the tent of David, the one having fallen, and I will rebuild  its fallen things. And the things having been razed of it, I will raise up, and I will rebuild it as the days of the eon;

12. so that [5should inquire 1the ones 2remaining 3of the 4men], and all the nations, the ones of whom [2was called upon  1my name] by them, says the lord, the one doing these things.

13. Behold, days come, says the lord, and [3shall overtake 1the 2threshing] the gathering of crops; and [3shall grow dark 1the 2grape] in the sowing; and [2shall trickle down 3the 4mountains 1sweetness], and all the hills shall be planted together.

14. And I will return the captivity  of my people Israel, and they shall rebuild the cities  having been obliterated, and shall inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and they shall drink  their wine; and they shall make gardens, and shall eat  their fruit.

15. And I will plant them upon  their land. And in no way shall they be pulled out any longer from  their land of which I gave to them, says the lord  God.
