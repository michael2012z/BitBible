## Esther 1

1.  Artaxerxes Makes a Banquet And it came to pass in the days of Artaxerxes. This  Artaxerxes [5from  6India 2a hundred 3twenty-seven 4regions 1held].

2. And in those  days when [3was enthroned 1king 2Artaxerxes] in Shushan the city,

3. in the third year of his reign, [2banquet 1he made a] to his friends, and to the rest of the nations, and to the Persians and Medes -- the honorable ones, and to the rulers of the satrapies.

4. And after these things, after the showing to them the riches  of his kingdom, and the glory  of his gladness for [3days 1a hundred 2eighty],

5. and when [3were fulfilled 1the 2days] of the wedding, [3made 1the 2king] a banquet for the nations, to the ones found in the city, for [2days 1six], in the courtyard of the house of the king,

6. being adorned in fine linen, and cotton being stretched upon lines of fine linen and of purple, upon cube studs of gold and silver, upon columns of Parian marble, and stones, with beds of gold and silver upon a stone pavement of emerald stone, and mother of pearl, and Parian marble stone, and [2strewn beds 1transparent 4variously 3being decorated],

7. with cups of gold and silver, wine abundant and agreeable, which [3himself 1the 2king] drank.

8.  But this banquet [2not 3according to 5being situated 4the law 1took place]; but thus [3wanted 1the 2king], and he gave orders to the managers to do  his will, and for the men.

9. And Vashti the queen made a banquet for the women in the palace where  king Artaxerxes was.

10. And on the [2day  1seventh] [4with pleasure 3being 1the 2king], said to Mehuman, and Biztha, and Harbona, and Bigtha, and Abagtha, and Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs  of king Artaxerxes,

11. to bring in the queen to him, to give her reign, and to put on her the diadem, and to show her to all the rulers and to the nations  of her beauty, for she was beautiful. 

12.  Queen Vashti Dishonors the King And [3did not 4listen to 5him 2Vashti  1queen] to come with the eunuchs. And [3fretted 1the 2king], and he was provoked to anger.

13. And he said to his friends, Thus these things Vashti spoke, you deal then concerning this law and judgment!

14. And came forward to him Carshena, and Shethar and Admatha, and Tarshish, and Meres and Marsena and Memucan seven rulers of the Persians and Medes, the ones near the king, the ones foremost being seated near the king.

15. And they reported to him according to the laws as what [4must 5do 1Vashti 2the 3queen], for she had not done the things [2by 3the 4king, 1having been assigned] through the eunuchs.

16. And Memucan said to the king and to the rulers, Not [5the 6king 1only 4wronged 3Vashti  2queen], but also all the rulers, and the leaders of the king,

17. (for he described to them the sayings of the queen) and how ever she contradicted the king, as then she did contradict to king Artaxerxes,

18. so today, the wives of the sovereigns of the rest of the rulers of the Persians and Medes hearing the things [2against the 3king 1having been said] by her, they shall dare in like manner to dishonor  their husbands.

19. If then it seems good to the king, let him assign a royal decree, and let him write it according to the laws of the Medes and Persians! and not otherwise treat nor let [4enter 3any longer 1the 2queen] to him, and  [5her royalty 1let 4give 2the 3king] to a woman better than her!

20. And let [6be heard 1the 2law  3by 4the 5king]! which ever he should make for  his kingdom. And thus all the women shall invest honor to their own husbands, from poor unto rich.

21. And [3pleased 1the 2word] the king and the rulers. And [3did 1the 2king] as Memucan said.

22. And he sent letters into all the kingdom, according to place, according to  their form of speech, so as to be fearing them in  their households.  

## Esther 2

1.  The Search for a Queen And after  these matters [4was abated 1the 2king's  3rage], and no longer was [2mentioned  1Vashti], remembering as much as she spoke, and how he condemned her.

2. And [5said 1the 2servants 3of the 4king], Let there be sought to the king young women uncorrupted, beautiful  in appearance!

3. And [3shall place 1the 2king] magistrates in all the places  of his kingdom, and let them choose young women, virgins, beautiful  in appearance to be brought to Shushan the city, into the chamber of the women! And let them be delivered to the eunuch of the king, the keeper of the women! And let there be given to them a beauty treatment, and the remaining care!

4. And the woman who ever should be pleasing to the king shall reign instead of Vashti. And [3pleased 4the 5king 1the 2thing], and he did so.

5. And there was a man, a Jew, in Shushan the city. And his name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin;

6. who was a captive from Jerusalem, which [5captured 1Nebuchadnezzar 2the 3king 4of Babylon].

7. And there was to this man a child that he brought up, the daughter of the brother of his father, and her name was Esther. And at the changeover of her  parents, he instructed her to himself for a woman. And [3was 1the 2young woman] good  in appearance.

8. And when [4was heard  1the 2king's 3order], [3were gathered together 1many 2young women] in Shushan the city, by the hand of Hegai; and Esther was led to Hegai the keeper of the women. 

9.  Esther Chosen Queen And [3pleased 4him 1the 2young woman], and she found favor before him. And he hastened to give her the beauty treatment, and her portion, and the seven young women  being exhibited to her from the royal palace. And he treated her well, and  her handmaidens in the chamber of the women.

10. But [2did not 3plainly show 1Esther]  her race, nor her fatherland.  For Mordecai gave charge to her not to report it.

11. And each day Mordecai walked by the [2courtyard  1feminine], overseeing what would come to pass with Esther.

12. For this was the time for a young woman to enter to the king, whenever she should have fulfilled [2months 1twelve], for thus are fulfilled the days of the treatment, [2months 1six] with the aromatics and with the beauty treatments for the women,

13. and [2months 1six] being anointed with myrrh oil, and then she enters to the king. And to whom ever he should tell, he delivers her to enter together with him, from the chamber of the women unto the palaces.

14. In the evening she enters, and by day she runs to the [2chamber of the women  1second], where Hegai the eunuch of the king the keeper of the women is. And no longer does she enter to the king if she should not be called by name.

15. And in the fulfilling the time, Esther the daughter of Abihail, brother of the father of Mordecai, entered to the king. Not one thing she disregarded which [6gave charge 7to her 1the 2eunuch  3keeper 4of the 5women]. [3was 1For 2Esther] found in favor by all the ones seeing her.

16. And Esther entered to Artaxerxes the king in the tenth month, which is Tebeth, in the seventh year  of his kingship.

17. And [3loved 5passionately 1the 2king 4Esther], and she found favor above all the virgins; and he placed upon her the [2diadem  1feminine].

18. And [3made 1the 2king] a banquet for all  his friends, and the powerful ones, for [2days 1seven]. And he exalted the wedding feasts of Esther; and [2a release 1he made] to the ones under  his kingdom.

19.  But Mordecai attended to affairs in the courtyard.

20.  Now Esther did not plainly tell  of her fatherland, for thus [2gave charge 3to her 1Mordecai], to fear  God, and to observe  his orders, as she was with him. And Esther did not change  her conduct.

21. And [6fretted 1the 2two 3eunuchs 4of the 5king], and the chiefs of the body guards, for Mordecai advanced. And they sought to kill Artaxerxes the king.

22. And [3was made manifest 4to Mordecai 1the 2matter], and he signaled it to Esther, and she revealed to the king the things of the plot.

23. And the king examined the two eunuchs, and he hanged them. And [3gave order 1the 2king] to write for a memorial in the royal library about the good-will of Mordecai with commendation.  

## Esther 3

1.  Haman's Contempt for Mordecai After these things [3extolled  1king 2Artaxerxes] Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and exalted him, and seated him first above all  his friends.

2. And all the ones in the courtyard did obeisance to him, for so [3assigned it 1the 2king] to do.  But Mordecai did not do obeisance to him.

3. And [7said 1the ones 2in 3the 4courtyard 5of the 6king] to Mordecai, O Mordecai, why do you disregard the things [2by 3the 4king 1being said]?

4. Accordingly each day they spoke to him, and he did not hearken to them; and they indicated  to Haman that Mordecai [2against 4of the 5king 3the words 1was rebelling]; and [2indicated 3to them 1Mordecai] that he is a Jew.

5. And Haman, realizing that [2did not 3do obeisance to 4him 1Mordecai], was enraged exceedingly. 

6.  Haman Plots to Destroy the Jews And he took counsel to remove all  [2under 3the 5of Artaxerxes 4kingdom 1the Jews].

7. And he made a referendum in [2year 1the twelfth] of the kingdom of Artaxerxes. And he cast lots day by day, and month by month, so as to destroy in one day the race of Mordecai. And [3fell 1the 2lot] on the fourteenth of the month, which is Adar.

8. And he spoke to  king Artaxerxes, saying, There exists a nation having been disseminated among the nations in all  your kingdom,  but their laws are special from all the nations; and of the laws of the king they disregard, and it is not advantageous to the king to allow them.

9. If it seems good to the king, let him decree to destroy them, and I will circumscribe for the treasury of the king [3of silver 2talents 1ten thousand].

10. And [3removing 1the 2king] the ring, gave it into the hands  of Haman, to set a seal on the things being written against the Jews.

11. And [3said 1the 2king]  to Haman, As for the silver, you have it! and for the nation, you treat it as you want!

12. And [3were called 1the 2scribes] by the king [2month 1in the first], the thirteenth day, and they wrote as Haman gave orders to the commandants, and to the rulers in every place from India unto  Ethiopia,  to a hundred twenty-seven places, to the  rulers of the nations according to  their form of speech, through Artaxerxes the king.

13. And it was sent by couriers unto the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to remove the race of the Jews on day one [2month 1of the twelfth], which is Adar, and to plunder  their possessions.

14. And the copies of the letters were displayed in each place. And it was assigned to all to be prepared for  that day.

15. [4was hastened 1And 2the 3thing], even in Shushan. And the king and Haman toasted, [4was disturbed 1but 2the 3city].  

## Esther 4

1.  Esther Learns of Haman's Plot  But Mordecai realizing the end, tore  his garments, and put on sackcloth, and strewed ashes; and rushing through the square of the city, he yelled [2voice 1with a great], [4is going to be taken away 1A nation 3no one 2having wronged].

2. And he came unto the gate of the king, and stood; [3not 1for 2it was 5for him 4allowed] to enter into the courtyard [2sackcloth 1having on] and ashes.

3. And in every place where [3were displayed 1the 2letters] there was a cry, and beating of the breast, and [2mourning 1great] among the Jews; and with sackcloth and ashes they made beds for themselves.

4. And [8entered 1the 2handmaidens 3and 4the 5eunuchs 6of the 7queen], and they announced to her. And she was disturbed hearing the thing taking place. And she sent to robe  Mordecai, and to remove from him the sackcloth;  but he did not yield.

5. And then Esther called on Hatach  her eunuch who stood beside her. And she sent to learn for herself from  Mordecai the exact situation.

6.  And Mordecai indicated to him the thing taking place, and the promise which Haman promised to the king, for [3to the 4treasury 2talents to be paid 1ten thousand], that he should destroy the Jews.

7. And the copy, the one in Shushan being displayed for purpose of destroying them, he gave to him to show  to Esther. And he told him to give charge to her to enter to ask pardon of the king, and to be found worthy by him for the people, remembering, said he, The days of your low estate, how you were maintained by my hand; because Haman the one being second to the king speaks against us for death. You call upon the lord, and speak to the king concerning us! even to rescue us from death.

8. [3entered 1And  2Hatach] and spoke to Esther all  these words.

9. [3said 1And 2Esther] to Hatach, You go to Mordecai, and say!

10. that, [2the 3nations 1All] of the kingdom know that every man or woman, who shall enter to the king, into the [2courtyard  1inner] uncalled, there is no deliverance to him, except to whomever [3stretches out 1the 2king] the golden rod, this one shall be delivered; and I have not been called to enter to the king -- they are these [2days 1thirty].

11. And Hatach reported to Mordecai all the words of Esther.

12. And Mordecai said to Hatach, Go and say to her! Esther, you should not say to yourself that you shall be delivered alone in the kingdom of all the Jews.

13. So that if you should disregard at this  time, from elsewhere help and protection will be to the Jews, but you and the house  of your father will be destroyed; and who knows if it be for  this occasion you reigned.

14. And Esther sent the one having come to her to Mordecai, saying,

15. In proceeding, you hold an assembly of the Jews  in Shushan, and you all fast for me! And you should not eat nor drink for [2days 1three] -- night and day. And I and the handmaidens of mine shall go without food; and then I shall enter to the king contrary to the law, even if [3to perish 2for me 1it is necessary].

16. And proceeding, Mordecai did as much as [2gave charge 3to him 1Esther].  

## Esther 5

1.  Esther Appears before the King And it came to pass in the [2day  1third], Esther put on royal apparel, and she stood in the courtyard of the house of the king, in the inner courtyard, right opposite the royal house of the king. And the king sat down on the throne  of his own kingdom in the [2house  1royal], right opposite the door of the house.

2. And as [3saw 1the 2king] Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, that she found favor in his eyes; and [3stretching out 1the 2king] to Esther the [2rod  1golden], the one in  his hand, that Esther approached and touched the tip of the rod.

3. And [3said 1the 2king], What do you want, Esther, and what is your request? The worth unto half  of my kingdom will be to you.

4. And Esther said, [4day 5for me 3a notable 1Today 2is]. If then it seems good to the king, let [6come 1both 2the 3king 4and 5Haman] to the banquet which I shall prepare today!

5. And [3said 1the 2king], Hasten Haman, so that we should do the word of Esther! And they came both to the banquet which Esther made. 

6.  Esther's Banquet And at the banquet [3said 1the 2king] to Esther, What is it to you, queen Esther, and it will be to you as much as is worthy?

7. And she said, The request of mine and  my petition,

8. if I found favor before the king, let [5come 1the 2king 3and 4Haman] upon the morrow to the banquet which I shall prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do the same!

9. And [2went forth 1Haman] from the king overjoyed and being glad. But in  Haman seeing Mordecai the Jew in the courtyard, he was enraged exceedingly.

10. And entering into  his own place he called his friends, and Zeresh  his wife.

11. And he showed to them  his riches, and the glory which the king invested in him, and how he made him to be preeminent, and to take the lead of the kingdom.

12. And Haman said, [4no one 3has called 1The 2queen] with the king, not one to the banquet but me, and for  tomorrow she has invited me.

13. And these things [3me 1do not 2please], whenever I behold Mordecai the Jew in the courtyard.

14. And [3said 4to 5him 1Zeresh  2his wife], and his friends, Fell for yourself a tree [2cubits 1of fifty], and at dawn speak to the king, and hang Mordecai upon the tree; and you enter into the banquet with the king, and be glad! And [3pleased 1the 2saying]  Haman, and [3was prepared 1the 2tree].  

## Esther 6

1.  The King Honors Mordecai But the lord removed the sleep from the king  that night; and he told  his servant to carry in [2letters 1the memorandum] of the days to read to him.

2. And he found letters  having been written concerning Mordecai, as was reported to the king concerning the two eunuchs of the king, during  their watching and their seeking to put  hands on Artaxerxes.

3. [4said 1And 2the 3king], What glory or favor did we do  for Mordecai? And [5said 1the 2servants 3of the 4king], We did not do for him one thing.

4. And during the inquiring by the king concerning the good-will of Mordecai, behold, Haman was in the courtyard. [4said 1And 2the 3king], Who is in the courtyard?  And he entered to speak to the king to hang  Mordecai upon the tree which he prepared.

5. And [5said 1the 2servants 3of the 4king], Behold, Haman stands in the courtyard. And [3said 1the 2king], Call him!

6. [4said 1And 2the 3king]  to Haman, What shall I do to the man whom I want to extol? [3said 1And 4to 5himself 2Haman], Who does [3want 1the 2king] to extol unless me?

7. And he said to the king, As for the man whom the king wants to extol,

8. let [5bring 1the 2servants 3of the 4king 7apparel 6fine linen] which the king puts on, and the horse upon which the king mounts,

9. and give it to one of the friends of the king of the honorable ones; and robe the man whom the king loves, and mount him upon the horse, and let him proclaim through the square of the city! saying, So shall it be done to every man whom the king extols.

10. [4said 1And 2the 3king]  to Haman, [2well 1You spoke], you do thus  to Mordecai the Jew, to the one attending in the courtyard, and do not let fall from you a word which you spoke!

11. And Haman took the robe, and the horse, and he robed  Mordecai, and mounted him upon the horse, and went through the square of the city, and proclaimed, saying, So it will be to every man the king wants to extol.

12. [3returned 1And  2Mordecai] to the courtyard. And Haman returned to  his own place fretting with a down cast head.

13. And Haman described the things coming to pass to him to Zeresh  his wife, and  to his friends. And [5said 6to 7him 1the 2friends 3and  4wife], Since [2of 3the race 4of the Jews 1Mordecai is], and you began to be humbled before him, in falling you shall fall, in no way should you be able to defend against him, for the living God is with him.

14. While they were yet speaking, [3came 1the 2eunuchs] to hurry  Haman unto the banquet which Esther prepared.  

## Esther 7

1.  Haman's Plot Is Revealed And they entered, the king and Haman, to drink together with the queen.

2. [4said 1And 2the 3king] to Esther on the second day at the banquet, What is it queen Esther? And what is  your request? And what is  your petition? And it will be yours unto half  of my kingdom!

3. And answering she said, If I found favor before the king, let him give  life to my request, and  my people to my petition.

4. [5were sold 1For 2both I 3and  4my people] into destruction, and ravaging, and slavery; we, and both  our children for manservants and maidservants, and I neglected to speak; [4is not 1for 5worthy 2the 3slanderer] of the courtyard of the king.

5. [4said 1And 2the 3king], Who is this who dared to do  this thing?

6. And Esther said, A man, an enemy, Haman,  this wicked man. And Haman was disturbed before the king and the queen.

7. And the king rose up from the party to go into the garden.  And Haman appealed to the queen, for he saw himself [2in 3evils 1being].

8. [4returned 1And 2the 3king] from out of the garden; and Haman had fallen upon the bed petitioning the queen. [4said 1And 2the 3king], So as even with my wife you use force in  my house. And Haman, hearing, was overawed  in front of him.

9. [6said 1And 2Harbonah 3one 4of the 5eunuchs] to the king, Behold, [2even 3a tree 1Haman prepared] for Mordecai, to the one speaking for the king, and it was set straight up in the places of Haman -- [2cubits 1of fifty]. [4said 1And 2the 3king], Let him be crucified upon it!

10. And Haman was hung upon the tree which he prepared for Mordecai. And then the king slackened from the rage.  

## Esther 8

1.  Esther Petitions the King And in that day  king Artaxerxes presented  to Esther as much as existed to Haman the slanderer. And Mordecai was called on by the king, for Esther indicated how he was related to her.

2. [4took 1And 2the 3king] the ring which he removed from Haman, and he gave it to Mordecai. And Esther placed Mordecai over all the things  of Haman.

3. And proceeding, she spoke to the king, and fell unto  his feet, and petitioned him to remove the evil of Haman, and as much as he did to the Jews.

4. [4stretched out 1And 2the 3king] to Esther the [2rod  1gold], and Esther arose to stand beside the king.

5. And Esther said, If it seems good to you, and I found favor, let it be sent forth to return the letters  being sent from Haman, the ones having been written to destroy the Jews who are in  your kingdom.

6. For how shall I be able to behold the ill treatment  of my people? And how shall I be able to be delivered in the destruction  of my fatherland?

7. And [3said 1the 2king] to Esther, If all the possessions of Haman I gave and granted to you, and he I hanged upon the tree for the hands he bore against the Jews, what yet do you anxiously seek? 

8.  Orders Given to Help the Jews [2write 1And you] in  my name as it seems good to you, and set a seal with  my ring! For as much as is written of the king in giving an order, and the seal should be set  by my ring, it is not to them to contradict.

9. [4were called 1And 2the 3scribes] in the first month, which is Nisan, on the third and twentieth day of the same year. And it was written to the Jews, as much as was given charge to the local managers, and to the rulers of the satrapies from  India unto  Ethiopia -- a hundred twenty-seven satrapies, according to place by place, according to  their form of speech.

10. And it was written through the king, and the seal was set by  his ring, and they sent out the letters by couriers,

11. as he gave orders to them to deal with  their laws in every city, both to help them and to deal with  their opponents, and with their adversaries as they wanted,

12. on [2day 1one] in all the kingdom of Artaxerxes, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar.

13. And the copies, let them be displayed clear to the eyes in all the kingdom, [6prepared 1and for 5to be 2all 3the 4Jews] for this  day, for them to wage war against their opponents.

14. Then the horsemen went forth hastening [2the things 4by 5the 6king 3being spoken 1to complete]. [4was displayed 1And 2the 3order] also in Shushan.

15.  And Mordecai went forth robed in the royal apparel, and [2a crown 1having] of gold, and a diadem [2fine line 1of purple]. [5beholding 1And 2the ones 3in 4Shushan] rejoiced.

16. And to the Jews there became light and gladness.

17. In each city and place of which ever [3was displayed 1the 2public notice], there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with toasting and gladness. And many of the nations were circumcised, and were Jewish-like because of the fear of the Jews.  

## Esther 9

1.  The Jews Destroy Their Adversaries For in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth of the month, which is Adar, [7were at hand 1the 2letters  3written 4by 5the 6king].

2. And in that  day [5were destroyed 1the 2adversaries 3of the 4Jews], [4no one 1for 5opposed 2fearing 3them].

3. For the rulers of the satraps, and the sovereigns, and the royal scribes esteemed the Jews, for the fear of Mordecai rested upon them.

4. [6fell 1For 2the 3order 4of the 5king] for him to be named in all the kingdom.

5. And in Shushan the city the Jews killed [2men 1five hundred] --

6. both Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

7. and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha and Parmashta, and Arisai,

8. and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

9. even the ten sons of Haman, son of Hammedatha the Bougean, the enemy of the Jews; but they plundered not in that  day.

10. And was given the number to the king of the ones being destroyed in Shushan.

11. [4said 1And 2the 3king] to Esther, The Jews destroyed in Shushan [2men 1five hundred] in the city; and in the place round about, how do you imagine they were treated? What then do you still petition, for it will be yours?

12. And Esther said to the king, Let it be given for the Jews to deal likewise  tomorrow, so as far the ten sons of Haman to hang.

13. And [3committed it 1the 2king] so to be. And he displayed to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Haman to hang.

14. And [3gathered together 1the 2Jews] in Shushan on the fourteenth day  of Adar, and they killed [2men 1three hundred], but nothing they plundered.

15. And the rest of the Jews, of the ones in the kingdom, gathered together and helped themselves, and gained rest from the warlike men; for they destroyed of them, [2ten thousands 1seven], and five thousand men on the thirteenth  of Adar, but [2nothing 1they plundered].

16. And they rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and they celebrated it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.

17. And the Jews in Shushan the city gathered together also on the fourteenth and rested. But they celebrated even on the fifteenth with joy and gladness.

18. Because of this then the Jews, the ones being disseminated in every place  outside, celebrate on the fourteenth  of Adar, [2day 1a good] with gladness, [2sending 3portions 1each] to his neighbor.

19. [3wrote 1And 2Mordecai]  these words in a scroll and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to the ones near and to the ones far;

20. to establish  these days as good days, and to celebrate both the fourteenth and the fifteenth  of Adar. 

21.  The Holiday of Purim For in these  days [3gained rest 1the 2Jews] from  their enemies. And the month in which things turned for them, which was Adar, from mourning to joy, and from grief to good days, was to celebrate entirely for good days of wedding feasts and gladness, sending gift portions to their friends and to the poor.

22. And [3favorably received it 1the 2Jews] as [2wrote 3to them  1Mordecai],
