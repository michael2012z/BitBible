4. The soul, in what ever he should swear by an oath, drawing apart his lips to do evil or [2well 1to do] according to all as much as [3who should draw apart 1the 2man] according to an oath, and should be unaware of it, and this one should know and should sin any one of these things --

And the soul which ever should touch any thing unclean, or from an uncleanness of man, or of the four-footed creatures of the unclean, or any abomination of an unclean thing, and should eat from the meats of the sacrifice of the peace offerings which is for the lord, [2shall be destroyed  1that soul] from  its people.

22. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Speak to the sons of Israel! saying, All fat of oxen and sheep and goats you shall not eat!

24. And the fat of decaying flesh, and that taken by wild beasts shall be appointed for all work, but for food it shall not be eaten.

30.  His own hands shall bring the yield offerings to the lord; the fat  upon the breast, and the lobe, the one upon the liver, he shall bring them so as to place a gift before the lord.

31. And [3shall offer 1the 2priest] the fat upon the altar. And [3shall be 1the 2breast] Aaron's and  his sons.

32. And the [2shoulder  1right] you shall give as a cut-away portion to the priest from the sacrifices  of your deliverance offering.

33. The one offering the blood of the deliverance offering, and the fat, of the sons of Aaron -- to him will be the [2shoulder  1right] for a portion.

34. For the breast of the increase offering and the shoulder of the cut-away portion I have taken from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices  of your deliverance offering, and I gave them to Aaron to the priest and to his sons, [2law 1an eternal] for the sons of Israel.

35. This is the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing  of his sons, of their portion of the yield offerings of the lord, in which day he brought them  to officiate as priest to the lord;

36. in so far as the lord gave charge to give to them in which day he anointed them from the sons of Israel, [2law 1an eternal] unto  their generations.

37. This is the law of the whole burnt-offerings, and of sacrifice, and for a sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice  of deliverance offering,

3. And to the council of elders of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take a young he-goat from out of the goats, one for a sin offering, and a young calf, and a lamb of a year old for a whole offering, unblemished;

4. and a calf, and a ram for a sacrifice of deliverance offering, before the lord; and fine flour being mixed up with olive oil! For today the lord will appear among you.

2. And came forth fire from the lord, and it devoured them, and they died before the lord.

3. And Moses said to Aaron, This is what the lord spoke, saying, Among the ones approaching to me I will be sanctified, and in all the congregation I will be glorified. And Aaron was vexed.

4. And Moses called  Mishael and  Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel brother of the father of Aaron, and said to them, Come forward and lift  your brethren from before the holies outside of the camp.

5. And they came forward, and lifted them by  their garments outside of the camp, in which manner Moses said.

6. And Moses said to Aaron, and Eleazar and Ithamar  his sons  being left behind,  Your heads shall not be without a turban, and  your cloaks you shall not tear, that you should not die, and [3upon 4all 5the 6congregation 2be 1rage].  But your brethren, all the house of Israel, shall weep for the combustion, which [2set on fire 1the lord].

7. And from the door of the tent of the testimony you shall not go forth, that you should not die. [2the 3oil 1For] of the anointing  of the lord [2upon 3you 1is]. And they did according to the saying of Moses.

8. And the lord spoke  to Aaron, saying,

9. Wine and liquor you are not to drink, you and  your sons with you, when ever you should enter into the tent of the testimony, or in your going to the altar, that no way you should die -- it is [2law 1an eternal] unto  your generations;

10. to distinguish between the holy things and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean,

11. and to instruct the sons of Israel all together the laws which the lord spoke to them through the hand of Moses.

12. And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of his  being left, You take the sacrifice offering  being left from the yield offerings of the lord, and eat unleavened breads by the altar! For [2a holy 3of holies 1it is].

13. And you shall eat it in [2place 1the holy]. [3a law 1For 4to you 2it is], and a law to your sons -- this from the yield offerings of the lord. For thus it has been given charge to me.

14. And the breast of the separation offering, and the shoulder of the cut-away portion you shall eat in [2place 1the holy], you, and  your sons, and  your house with you -- a law to you, and a law to your sons it was given of the sacrifices of the deliverance offerings of the sons of Israel.

15. The shoulder of the cut-away portion and the breast of the separation offering upon the yield offerings of the fats, they shall bring as a separation offering to separate before the lord. And it will be to you, and to your sons, and to your daughters with you, [2law 1an eternal]; in which manner the lord gave orders to Moses.

16. And [2the 3young he-goat  4for 5the 6sin offering 1seeking] Moses sought after. But thus it had been set on fire. And Moses was enraged at Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron, the ones being left, saying,

17. Why did you not eat the thing for the sin offering in [2place 1the holy]? For because [2a holy 3of holies 1it is]. This he gave to you to eat, that you should remove the sin of the congregation, and should atone for them before the lord.

18. For not was brought from the blood of it into the holy place. In person inside you shall eat it in [2place 1the holy], in which manner it was ordered to me.

19. And Aaron spoke to Moses, saying, If today they have brought the things for  their sin offering, and the things of their whole burnt-offerings before the lord, and has come to pass to me such things, and I shall eat the thing -- for the sin offering today, shall it be pleasing to the lord?

17. and [3shall see 4him 1the 2priest], and behold, [3turned 1the 2infection] to the white, then [3shall declare him cleansed 1the 2priest] by the infection -- he is clean.

18. And if flesh should have [2in  3his skin 1a lesion], and should heal,

19. and there should become in the place of the lesion, [2discoloration 1a white], or radiant being whitened, or being reddish, and it should be looked at by the priest;

20. then [3shall look 1the 2priest], and behold, if the appearance be deeper under the skin, and  its hair turns into white, then [3shall declare him defiled 1the 2priest], for it is leprosy, [2in 3the 4lesion 1it broke out].

21. But if [3should look at 4him 1the 2priest], and behold, there is no [3on 4it 2hair 1white], and [2deep 1it should not be] under the skin of the flesh, and it should be faint, then [3shall separate 4him 1the 2priest] seven days.

22. But if in a diffusion it should have diffused in the skin, then [3shall declare him defiled 1the 2priest]; [2an infection 3of leprosy 1it is]; [2in 3the 4lesion 1it broke out].

23. And if in its place [3should abide 1the 2radiance], and should not diffuse, [2a discoloration 3of the 4lesion 1it is], and [3shall cleanse 4him 1the 2priest].

24. And if flesh should become [3in  4his skin 2inflammation 1a fiery], and there should be in  his skin the healing of the inflammation, shining forth radiant white, becoming somewhat reddish or very white;

25. then [3shall look at 4him 1the 2priest], and behold, [2is turned 1if the hair] white in the shining forth, and the appearance of it is deep under the skin, it is leprosy; [2in 3the 4inflammation 1it broke out], and [3shall declare him defiled 1the 2priest]; [2an infection 3of leprosy 1it is].

26. But if [3should look at 4him 1the 2priest], and behold, there is not in the shining forth [2hair 1a white], and [2deep 1it should not be] under the skin, but it is faint, then [3shall separate 4him 1the 2priest] seven days.

27. And [3shall look at 4him 1the 2priest] in the [2day  1seventh]. But if the diffusion should diffuse in the skin, then [3shall declare him defiled 1the 2priest]; [2an infection 3of leprosy 1it is]; [2in 3the 4lesion 1it broke out].

28. But if [4in its 5place 3should stay 1the 2shining forth], and should not be diffused in the skin, but it should be faint, [2a discoloration 3of 4an inflammation 1it is], and [3should declare him cleansed 1the 2priest];  for [2an effect 3of 4an inflammation 1it is].

29. And a man or a woman, in whom ever has in themselves an infection of leprosy in the head or in the beard;

30. then [3shall look at 1the 2priest] the infection. And behold,  if its appearance be imbedded under the skin, [2in 3it 1and 6hair 4a yellowish 5thin], then [3shall declare him defiled 1the 2priest]; it is an outbreak, [2a leprosy 3of the 4head 5or 6a leprosy 7of the 8beard 1it is].

31. And if [3should look at 1the 2priest] the infection of the outbreak, and behold, [3is not 1the 2appearance] imbedded under the skin, and the hair [2yellowish 1is not] in it, then [3shall separate 1the 2priest] the infection of the outbreak seven days.

32. And [3shall look at 1the 2priest] the infection on the [2day  1seventh]. And behold, [3should not be diffused 1if the 2outbreak], and [4hair 3yellowish 2no 1there is] in it, and the appearance of the outbreak is not hollow under the skin;

33. then [3shall be shaven 1the 2skin], but the outbreak shall not be shaven; and [3shall separate 1the 2priest] the outbreak seven days for the second time.

34. And [3shall look at 1the 2priest] the outbreak on the [2day  1seventh]; and behold, [3should not 4be diffused 1if the 2outbreak] in the skin after the shaving of it, and the appearance of the outbreak is not hollow under the skin, then [3shall cleanse 4him 1the 2priest]; and washing  his garments, he will be clean.

35. But if the diffusion should be diffused in the outbreak in the skin after  cleansing it,

36. then [3shall look at 4him 1the 2priest], and behold, [3should be diffused 1if the 2outbreak] in the skin, [3shall not 4examine 1the 2priest] concerning the hair  being yellowish -- he is unclean.

37. But if before him [3should abide 4in 5its place 1the 2outbreak], and [2hair 1a black] should rise in it, [3is healed 1the 2outbreak] -- he is clean, and [3shall declare him cleansed 1the 2priest].

38. And a man or woman, in whom ever should have in the skin  of his flesh shinings shining forth being white,

39. then [3shall look 1the 2priest]; and behold, in the skin  of his flesh shinings shining forth being white, it is a psoriasis, it broke out in the skin, he is clean.

40. And if any one be loose of hair then his head is only bald; he is clean.

41. But if [3by 4his face 2is loose of hair  1his head], he is forehead bald; he is clean.

42. But if there becomes in  his baldness, or in  his being forehead bald [2infection 1a white] or reddening, [2leprosy 3blossoming 1it is] in  his baldness, or in  his forehead baldness.

43. And [3shall look at 4him 1the 2priest]. And behold, if the appearance of the infection be white or reddish in the his baldness, or in  his being forehead bald as the form of leprosy in the skin  of his flesh,

44. [3man 2a leprous 1he is], he is unclean; in defilement [3shall declare him defiled 1the 2priest] -- in  his head is his infection.

45. And the leper in whom is the infection,  his garments shall be disabled, and  his head uncovered, and concerning  his mouth let him put something around it! And [2unclean 1he shall call himself]

46. all the days, as many as [3might be 4upon 5him 1the 2infection] -- being unclean, he shall be unclean; being separated he shall sit down outside  of his camp, it will be to him a place for pastime.

47. And a garment which ever should have in it an infection of leprosy in [2garment 1a woolen], or in a garment made of hemp,

48. or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the flaxen linens, or in the woolen threads, or in a skin, or in any workmanship of skin,

49. and [3should become 1the 2infection] greenish or reddish in the skin, or in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any item of workmanship of skin, [2an infection 3of leprosy 1it is]; and he shall show it to the priest.

50. And [3shall look at 1the 2priest] the infection; and [3shall separate 1the 2priest] the infection seven days.

51. And he shall look at the infection on the [2day  1seventh]. But if [3should diffuse 1the 2infection] in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, according to all as much as might be made with the skins in the work, [2leprosy 1it is permanent];  [2infection 1it is an unclean].

54. then [3shall order 1the 2priest], and one shall wash that upon which ever there might be [2upon 3it  1an infection]; and [3shall separate 1the 2priest] the infection seven days for the second time.

55. And [3shall look 1the 2priest] after the washing the infection; and thus [3in no way 4should turn 1the 2infection]  of its appearance, and the infection did not diffuse, it is unclean; in fire you shall incinerate it; it is fixed firm in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof.

57. And if it should appear still in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any item made of skin, [2leprosy 3breaking forth 1it is]; by fire you shall incinerate [5in 1that which 4is 2the 3infection].

58. And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any item made of skin which shall be washed, and [3leaves 4from 5it 1the 2infection], that it shall be washed the second time, and it shall be clean.

59. This is the law of an infection of leprosy of a garment of wool, or made of hemp, or warp, or woof, or any item made of skin, in the declaring it cleansed or defiled.

32. This is the law for him in whom is found the infection of the leprosy, and  not finding means in his hand enough for  his cleansing. 

33.  Laws Regarding Leprosy in Houses And the lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

34. When ever you should enter into the land of the Canaanites, which I give to you for a possession, and I put an infection of leprosy in the houses of the land  procured by you;

35. then [5shall come 1one 2from 3the 4house] and shall announce to the priest, saying, Something as an infection has appeared to me in the house.

36. And [3will assign 1the 2priest] to pack up the house before the [2enters  1priest] to look at the infection, that no way [2unclean 1should become] as much as might be in the house. And after these things [3shall enter 1the 2priest] to study the house.

49. And he shall take to purify the house, two small [2birds 1living], and wood of cedar, and twined scarlet, and hyssop.

50. And he shall slay the [2small bird  1one] into [2utensil 1an earthenware] over [2water 1living].

51. And he shall take the wood  of cedar, and the twined scarlet, and the hyssop, and the [2small bird  1living]; and he shall dip them into the blood of the small bird  having been slain over [2water 1living]; and he shall sprinkle about with them upon the house seven times.

52. And he shall purify the house with the blood of the small bird, and with the [2water  1living], and with the [2small bird  1living], and with the wood  of cedar, and with the hyssop, and with the twined scarlet.

54. This is the law for every infection of leprosy, and outbreak,

55. and the leprosy of a garment, and house,

56. and discoloration, and spot, and  shining;

57.  to describe the day unclean, and the day it shall be cleansed. This is the law of the leprosy.

24. I will go also with you in rage sideways, and I will strike you also seven times for  your sins.

25. And I will bring upon you a sword, avenging punishment of covenant. And you shall take refuge in  your cities, and I will send out plague upon you; and you shall be delivered up into the hands of the enemies.

26. In  your being afflicted there will be scarcity of bread loaves. [3shall bake 1Ten 2women]  your bread loaves in [2oven 1one], and they shall give back the bread loaves to you by weight; and you shall eat, and no way shall you be filled.

27. And if upon this you do not obey me, but should go to me sideways,

28. then I myself shall go with you in rage sideways, and I will correct you, even I, seven times according to  your sins.

29. And you shall eat the flesh  of your sons; and the flesh  of your daughters you shall eat.

30. And I will make desolate  your monuments, and I will utterly destroy  [2wooden images 3made by hands 1your]. And I will put  your carcasses upon the carcasses  of your idols. And [2will loathe  1my soul] in you.

31. And I will establish  your cities as desolate, and I will make quite desolate  your holy places; and no way shall I smell the scents  of your sacrifices.

32. And I will make quite desolate, even I,  your land. And [5shall wonder 6over 7it  1your enemies  2dwelling 3in 4it].

33. And I will disseminate you into the nations; and [4will completely consume 5you 3coming upon you 1the 2sword]; and [2will be  1your land] desolate, and  your cities will be desolate places.

34. Then [3will favor 1the 2land]  its Sabbaths all the days  of its desolation, and you will be in the land  of your enemies. Then [3shall observe the Sabbath 1the 2land], and will favor  its Sabbaths.

35. All the days  of its desolation it shall observe the Sabbath, in which it did not observe the Sabbath in  your Sabbaths, when you dwelt it.

36. And to the ones being left behind of you, I will bring timidity into  their heart in the land  of their enemies. And [4will pursue 5them 1the sound 2of a leaf 3being brought along], and they shall flee as fleeing from war, and they shall fall with no one pursuing.

37. And [3will neglect 1the 2brother]  his brother as in war, but no one running them down. And you will not be able to oppose  your enemies.

38. And you shall perish among the nations, and [4will devour 5you 1the 2land  3of your enemies].

39. And the ones being left behind from you shall be corrupted on account of  their sins, and on account of the sins  of their fathers. In the land  of their enemies they shall be melted away.

40. And they shall declare openly  their sins, and the sins  of their fathers; for they violated and overlooked me, and that they went before me sideways.

41. And I went with them in rage sideways, and I will destroy them in the land  of their enemies. Then [4shall have felt shame  3heart 1their  2uncircumcised], and then they shall think well on  their sins. 

42.  The LORD shall Remember His Covenant And I shall remember the covenant of Jacob, and the covenant of Isaac; and the covenant of Abraham I shall remember; and the land I shall remember.

43. And the land shall be abandoned of them. Then [3shall favorably receive 1the 2land]  her Sabbaths, in  her being made desolate because of them. And they shall accept the things of their own lawlessness, because  [2my judgments 1they overlooked], and  [2my orders 1they loathed]  in their soul.

44. And thus, they being in the land  of their enemies, I did not overlook them, nor loathed in them so as to completely consume them  for effacing  my covenant, the one with them. For I am the lord  their God.

45. And I will remember their covenant, the former one, when I led them out of the land of Egypt, from out of the house of slavery before the nations,  to be their God. I am the lord.

46. These are the judgments, and the orders, and the law, which the lord made between himself and between the sons of Israel on  mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.  

## Leviticus 27

1.  The Value of Vows And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel! And you shall say unto them, A man who ever should vow a vow for a value  of his life to the lord,

3. it will be the value of a male from twenty years unto sixty years old -- [3will be 1his  2value] fifty double-drachmas of silver by the [2weight  1holy].

4. And the female will be the price of thirty double-drachmas.

5. And if from five years old unto twenty years old, [5shall be 1the 2value 3of the 4male] twenty double-drachmas, and the female ten double-drachmas.

6. And from a month unto five years old, [5shall be 1the 2value 3of the 4male] five double-drachmas of silver, and the female three double-drachmas of silver.

7. And if from sixty years old and up, if indeed [2a male 1it might be], [2shall be  1his value] fifteen double-drachmas of silver; for the female ten double-drachmas.

8. And if [2of low estate 1he might be] for a value, he shall be stood before the priest, and [3shall value 4him 1the 2priest], just as [5is able to afford 1the 2hand 3of the 4one making a vow] -- thus [3shall value 4him 1the 2priest].

9. And if it be from the cattle of the ones being offered of them as a gift to the lord, who ever should give of these to the lord, it shall be holy.

10. He shall not change it good for bad, nor bad for good. And if by bartering he should barter it cattle for cattle, [5shall be 1it 2and 3the 4thing bartered] holy.

11. And if any [2beast 1unclean], of which none are offered of them as a gift to the lord, he shall set the beast before the priest,

12. and [3shall value 4it 1the 2priest], between good and between bad. And as far as [3valuing 4it 1the 2priest], so it will stand.

13. And if the one ransoming should ransom it, he shall add the fifth part to the value of it.

14. And a man, who ever should sanctify  his house holy to the lord, then [3shall value 4it 1the 2priest] between good and between bad; what ever [3shall value 4it 1the 2priest], so it shall stand.

15. And if the one sanctifying it should redeem  his house, he shall add unto it the fifth part  of the money for the value, and it shall be his.

16. And if [3from 4the 5field  6of his possession 2should sanctify 1a man] to the lord, then [3shall be 1the 2value] according to  its sowing -- a cor of barley equals fifty double-drachmas of silver.

17. And if from the year of the release he should sanctify  his field, according to  his value it shall stand.

18. But if [3last 4after 5the 6release 1he should sanctify  2his field], [3shall count in addition 4to it 1the 2priest] the money for the years  remaining, until unto the next year of the release, and it shall be deducted from  his valuation.

19. And if [5should ransom 3the 4field 1the 2one sanctifying] it, he shall add the fifth part of the money to the value of it, and it will be his.

20. And if he should not ransom the field, and should give back the field [2man 1to another], no longer shall he ransom it.

21. But [6will be 1the 2field 3coming forth 4from the 5release] holy to the lord, as the land  being separated; to the priest it will be his possession.

22. And if from the field of which he acquired, which is not from the field  of his possession, that he should sanctify to the lord,

23. the priest shall impute to him the full  value from the year of the release, and he shall render the value in  that day as holy to the lord.

24. And in the year of the release, he shall give back the field to the man from whom he acquired it, of whom was  in possession of the land.

25. And all value will be [2weights 1by holy] -- twenty oboli will be the double-drachma.

26. And every first-born which ever should be born among  your cattle will be to the lord. And  [2shall consecrate 3it 1no one]. If also a calf, if also a sheep, [2to the 3 lord 1it is].

27. And if of the four-footed creatures of the unclean he should barter for the value of it, then he shall add  his fifth part to it, and it will be his. But if he should not ransom it, it shall be sold according to  its valuation.

28. And every offering for consumption which ever [2should present 1a man] to the lord of all as much as is to him, from man unto beast, and from a field of his possession, he shall not sell it, nor ransom it; every offering for consumption [2a holy 3of holies 1will be] to the lord.

29. And all, what ever should be presented from  men, it shall not be ransomed, but to death it shall be put to death.

30. Every tenth of the land, from the seed of the land, and from the fruit of the wood to the lord, it is holy to the lord.

31. And if ransoming [2should ransom 1a man]  of his tenth,  his fifth part he shall add to it, and it will be his.

32. And every tenth of oxen, and sheep, and all which should go through in the number by the rod measure, the tenth will be holy to the lord.

33. You shall not barter it good for bad, nor bad for good. And if in bartering you should barter it, it shall be and  its barter holy, it shall not be ransomed.

34. These are the commandments which the lord gave charge to Moses for the sons of Israel on  mount Sinai.
