# Hosea

## Hosea 1

1.  Hosea Marries a Harlot The word of the lord which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, and Jotham, and Ahaz, and Hezekiah kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king  of Israel.

2. The beginning of the word of the lord by Hosea. And [3said 1the 2 lord] to Hosea, Proceed, take to yourself a wife of harlotry, and children of harlotry! because by fornicating [3shall fornicate 1the 2land] away from going after the lord.

3. And he went and took  Gomer daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore to him a son.

4. And [3said 1the 2 lord] to him, Call  his name Jezreel! because yet a little and I will avenge the blood  of Jezreel on the house of Judah, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.

5. And it will be in  that day I will break the bow  of Israel in the valley  of Jezreel.

6. And she conceived again, and she bore a daughter. And he said to him, Call the name of her, Not Being Shown Mercy! for in no way shall I proceed still to show mercy on the house of Israel; but by resisting I will resist them.

7. But the sons of Judah I will show mercy on, and I will deliver them by the lord their God, and I will not deliver them by bow, nor by broadsword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.

8. And she weaned  Not Being Shown Mercy. And she conceived and bore a son.

9. And he said, Call  his name, Not My People! because you are not my people, and I am not of you.

10. And shall be the number of the sons of Israel as the sand of the sea in which shall not be measured out nor shall be counted out. And it will be in the place of which it was said to them, [2not 3my people 1You are]; they shall be called, Sons of the living God.

11. And shall be gathered the sons of Judah, and the sons of Israel together. And they shall appoint to themselves [2sovereign 1one]. And they shall ascend from out of the land. For great is the day  of Jezreel.  

## Hosea 2

1.  Judgment on the Harlot and Her Children Speak to your brethren, My People, and to your sister, Being Shown Mercy!

2. Plead with  your mother! Plead! for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. And I will lift away  her harlotry from in front of me, and  her adultery from between  her breasts;

3. so that I shall strip her naked, and restore her as the day of her birth; and I will set her as desolate, and I will arrange her as [2land 1a waterless], and I will kill her by thirst.

4. And  [3on her children 1in no way 2shall I show mercy], for [2children 3of harlotry 1it is].

5. For [2fornicated  1their mother]; [4disgraced them 1the one 2bearing 3them]. For she said, I will go after  my lovers, the ones giving to me  my bread loaves, and  my water, and  my garments, and  my linen bands, and  my olive oil, and all as much as is fit for me.

6. On account of this, behold, I shut up  her way with barbs, and I will block  her ways, and  her road in no way should she find.

7. And she shall pursue  her lovers, and in no way shall she overtake them; and she shall seek them, and in no way shall she find them. And she shall say, I shall go and return to  [3husband 1my  2former], for [2good 3to me 1it was] then rather than now.

8. And she did not know that I gave to her the grain, and the wine, and the olive oil, and [2silver 1multiplied] to her. But she [2silver 3and 4gold things 1made] to Baal.

9. On account of this I will return and carry away  my grain according to its season, and  my wine in its time; and I will remove  my garments and  my linen bands so as to not cover  her indecency.

10. And now I will uncover  her uncleanness before  her lovers, and not one shall rescue her from out of my hand.

11. And I will turn away all  her gladness of her holiday feasts, and  her new moons, and  her Sabbaths, and all  her festivals.

12. And I will remove her grapevine, and  her fig-trees -- as much as she said, [3my wages 1These 2are] which [2gave 3to me  1my lovers]. And I will appoint them for a testimony. And [5shall devour 6them 1the 2wild beasts 3of the 4field], and the birds of the heaven, and the reptiles of the earth. 

13.  The LORD Takes Vengeance And I will take vengeance upon her for the days of the Baals, in which she sacrificed to them, and put on  her ear-rings, and  her hanging necklaces, and went after  her lovers; but me she forgot, says the lord.

14. On account of this, behold, I will wander her, and I will order her as desolate, and I will speak unto  her heart.

15. And I will give to her  her possessions from there, and the valley of Achor to open wide her understanding. And she shall be humbled there according to the days  of her infancy, and according to the days of her ascending from out of the land of Egypt.

16. And it will be in that  day, says the lord, she shall call me,  My husband, and shall not call me any longer, Baalim.

17. And I will lift away the names of the Baalim from her mouth, and in no way should [2be remembered 3any longer  1their names].

18. And I will ordain to them a covenant in  that day with the wild beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heaven, and the reptiles of the earth. And [2bow 3and 4broadsword 5and 6war 1I will break] from the earth, and I will settle upon hope. 

19.  The LORD Will Espouse Israel to Himself And I shall espouse you to myself into the eon; and I shall espouse you to myself in righteousness, and in equity, and in mercy, and in compassions.

20. And I will espouse you to myself in trust. And you shall recognize the lord.

21. And it will be in that  day, says the lord, I will give heed to the heaven, and the heaven shall give heed to the earth.

22. And the earth shall heed the grain, and the wine, and the olive oil; and they shall give heed  to Jezreel.

23. And I will sow her to myself upon the earth; and I will love the one not being loved. And I will say to the one not my people, [2my people 1You are]; and he shall say, [2the lord  3my God 1You are].  

## Hosea 3

1.  Israel Will Return to The LORD And the lord said to me, You go again and love a woman loving evil and an adulteress! even as [2loves 1the lord] the sons of Israel, and they look away unto  strange gods, and are fond of cakes with dried grapes.

2. And I hired her to myself for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a skin flask of wine.

3. And I said to her, [2days 1Many] you shall sit down by me, and in no way should you commit harlotry, nor should you be to a man, and I will be unto you.

4. For [2days 1many] [4shall sit down 1the 2sons 3of Israel] with there not being a king, nor there being a ruler, nor there being a sacrifice, nor there being an altar, nor a priesthood, nor manifestations.

5. And after these things [4shall return 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and they shall seek the lord  their God, and David  their king; and they shall be amazed over the lord, and over  his good things at the latter end of the days.  

## Hosea 4

1.  The Charge against Israel Hear the word of the lord, O sons of Israel! For there is a case to the lord against the ones dwelling the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor full knowledge of God upon the land.

2. Curse, and lie, and murder, and fraud, and adultery -- it poured upon the earth, and [2blood 3with 4blood 1they mingled].

3. On account of this [3shall mourn 1the 2land], and shall be diminished with all the ones dwelling it; with the wild beasts of the field, and with the winged creatures of the heaven; and the fishes of the sea shall fail,

4. so that no one should adjudicate, nor [2reprove 1should any one];  but my people are as a priest disputing;

5. and he shall weaken by day, and [3shall weaken 2also 1the prophet] with you. [3to night 1I likened  2your mother].

6. [2are likened  1My people] as ones not having knowledge. For since [3full knowledge 2thrusted away 1you], [2will thrust you away 1even I] so as to not officiate as priest to me. And as you forgot the laws of your God, I shall forget your children.

7. According to  their multitude, so they sinned against me.  [2their glory 3for 4dishonor 1I will appoint].

8. The sins of my people they shall eat, and in  their iniquities shall take  their lives.

9. And it will be as the people, so also the priest; and I will avenge upon him  his ways, and  his deliberations I will recompense to him. 

10.  Israel Commits Harlotry And they shall eat, but in no way should be filled up. They committed harlotry, and in no way should they be straightened. Because [3the 4 lord 1they abandoned  2to watch for].

11. Harlotry, and wine, and strong drink, took the heart of my people.

12. By their symbols they asked, and by their rods they reported to him. In a spirit of harlotry they were wandered, and they fornicated from  their God.

13. Upon the tops of the mountains they were sacrificed, and upon the hills they were sacrificed underneath the oak, and white poplar, and [2tree 1the overshadowing], for good protection. Because of this [2shall fornicate  1your daughters], and  your brides shall commit adultery.

14. And in no way shall I pay a visit unto  your daughters whenever they should commit harlotry, nor unto  your daughters-in-law whenever they should commit adultery. For they themselves [2with 3the 4harlots 1blended together], and [2with 3the ones 4initiating rites 1were sacrificed]. And the people not perceiving closely joined with the harlot.

15. But you, O Israel, be not ignorant! And Judah, enter not into Gilgal, and ascend not unto the house of On, and swear not an oath, saying, [2lives 1The lord]!

16. For [2as 3a heifer 4being in heat 1Israel was heated]. Now [2will feed 3them 1the lord] as a lamb in a broad space.

17. [2was a partner 3of idols 1Ephraim], he made obstacles to himself.

18. He took up with Canaanites, ones committing harlotry. They fornicated and loved dishonor of their neighing.

19. [2a tumultuous 3wind 1You are] in her wings, and they shall be disgraced because of  their altars.  

## Hosea 5

1.  Judgment against Israel and Ephraim Hear these things, O priests! And take heed, O house of Israel! And [2O house 3of the 4king 1give ear]! For [3against 4you 2is  1judgment]. For [2a snare 1you were] in the Height, and as a net being stretched out upon  Tabor,

2. which the ones catching the game firmly fastened; but I am your corrector.

3. I knew  Ephraim, and Israel is not removed from me. For now Ephraim fornicated; Israel was defiled.

4. They gave not  their deliberations  to turn towards  their God. For a spirit of harlotry is in the midst of them, and the lord they knew not.

5. And [4shall be humbled 1the 2insolence  3of Israel] unto his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall weaken in  their iniquities; and [3shall be weak 2also 1Judah] with them.

6. With sheep and calves they shall go  to seek after the lord, and in no way should they find him; he has turned aside from them.

7. For [2the 3 lord 1they abandoned]; for [2children 1alien] were born to them. Now [3shall devour 4them 1the 2blight] and  their lots of heritage. 

8.  Days of Reproof Trump the trumpet upon the hills! Sound out upon the high places! Proclaim in the house of On! Benjamin is startled.

9. Ephraim [2for 3extinction 1became] in the days of reproof. Among the tribes  of Israel I showed to be trustworthy.

10. [4became 1The 2rulers 3of Judah] as ones altering boundaries. Upon them I will pour out [2as 3water  1my impulse].

11. Ephraim tyrannized over  his opponent; he trampled  judgment, for he began to go after the vain things.

12. And I will be as a disturbance to Ephraim, and as a spur to the house of Judah.

13. And Ephraim beheld  his disease, and Judah  his grief. And Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent ambassadors to king Jareb; and he was not able to rescue; and in no way should there be a discontinuance of your grief.

14. For I am as a panther  to Ephraim, and as a lion to the house of Judah. And I will seize by force, and I will go, and I will take, and there shall not be  one rescuing.

15. I shall go and return unto  my place until of which time they should be removed from view; and they shall seek  my face.  

## Hosea 6

1.  Judah and Israel Violate the Covenant In  their affliction they will rise early to me, saying, We should go and return to the lord  our God, for he snatched us away, and he will heal us. He shall strike, and he shall dress our wounds.

2. He will heal us after two days, on the [2day  1third] we shall rise up, and we shall live before him.

3. And we shall know, and shall pursue  to know the lord. As dawn readied, we shall find him; and he shall come to us as rain early and late to the earth.

4. What shall I do to you, O Ephraim? What shall I do to you, O Judah? For your mercy is as [2cloud 1an early morning], and as [2dew 1early morning] going away.

5. On account of this I mowed you by the prophets; I killed them by the discourse of my mouth; and  your judgment as light shall go forth.

6. For mercy I want, and not sacrifice; and full knowledge of God rather than whole burnt-offerings.

7. But they are as a man violating covenant. There they showed disdain of me.

8. Gilead is a city working vanities, disturbing water.

9. And  your strength is as a man who is a maruader. [2hid 1The priests]; [2in the way 1they murdered] of Shechem; for [2lawlessness 1they committed] in the house  of Israel.

10. I beheld a cause for shuddering there, even the harlotry  of Ephraim; [4are defiled 1Israel 2and 3Judah].

11. Begin to gather the vintage for yourself in  my returning the captivity  of my people!  

## Hosea 7

1.  Falsehood of Ephraim and Samaria In  my healing  Israel, then [4was uncovered 1the 2injustice 3of Ephraim], and the evil of Samaria. For they worked falsehoods; and a thief [2to 3him 1entered], [2stripping him 1and a robber] in  his way;

2. so that they be together in concert as men singing in their heart that [2all  3their evils 1I remember]. Now [2encircled 3them  1their deliberations]; [2before  3my face 1they took place].

3. In  their evils they gladdened a king, and in  their lies rulers.

4. All committing adultery are as an oven burning for baking; burning from the flame, from mixing together of the fat until  its being leavened wholly.

5. In the days  of our kings [3began 1the 2rulers] to be enraged from wine; he stretched out  his hands with pestilent ones.

6. For [2were kindled 3as 4an oven  1their hearts] in  their breaking down all the night; [3of sleep 1Ephraim 2was filled]; in the morning it was kindled as [2of a fire 1a flame].

7. They were all heated as an oven, and they devoured  their judges; all  their kings are fallen; there was not one among them  calling to me. 

8.  Ephraim Forsakes God Ephraim [2in  3his peoples 1is intermixed]; Ephraim became a cake baked in hot ashes not being turned over.

9. And [2ate 1strangers]  his strength, but he did not know it; and gray hairs broke out to him, and he did not know it.

10. And [4shall be humbled 1the 2insolence 3of Israel] unto his face; but they turned not towards the lord  their God; and they sought not after him in all these things.

11. And Ephraim was as [2dove 1a mindless], not having a heart; Egypt he called upon, and unto Assyria they went.

12. As whenever they shall go I will put over them  my net; as the birds  of heaven, I will lead them down; I will correct them in the hearing  of their affliction.

13. Woe to them, for they leaped back from me. Wretched are they, for they were impious against me. But I ransomed them; but they spoke ill against me with lies,

14. and yelled out not to me  with their hearts, but only shrieked in  their beds; for grain and wine they mutilated themselves.

15. They were corrected by me; I strengthened  their arms; and against me they devised wicked things.

16. They returned unto nothing; they became as a bow being stretched tight; [2shall fall 3by 4the broadsword  1their rulers] because of the stupidity of their tongue; this is  their disparagement in the land of Egypt.  

## Hosea 8

1.  Apostasy of Israel Into their bosom as land, as an eagle against the house of the lord, because they violated  my covenant, and against  my law they were impious.

2. For me they shall cry out, O God, we have known you.

3. For Israel threw away good things; [2an enemy 1they pursued].

4. For themselves they made one to reign, and not through me. They ruled, and they did not make it known to me.  With their silver and  their gold they made to themselves idols, so that they should be utterly destroyed.

5. Cast off  your calf, O Samaria! [2is provoked  1My rage] against them. For how long will they in no way be able to cleanse themselves in  Israel?

6. And [3it 1the fabricator 2made], and [2not 3God 1it is]. Because [2was wandering you  1your calf], O Samaria.

7. For being destroyed by the wind they sowed, and  their final end looks out for them; a sheaf not having strength  to produce flour; and if even it should produce, strangers shall devour it.

8. Israel was swallowed down; now it became among the nations as [2item 1a useless].

9. For they ascended unto Assyria; [2flourished again 3according to 4himself 1Ephraim]; [2bribes 1he loved].

10. On account of this they shall be delivered up among the nations; now I will take them, and they shall abate a little  to anoint a king and rulers.

11. For Ephraim multiplied altars; for [4sins 3became 5to him 2altars 1his beloved].

12. I will write extra to him;  his laws [2as 3strange things 1were considered], [3altars 1the 2beloved].

13. For if they should sacrifice a sacrifice, and should eat meats, the lord shall not favorably receive them. Now he will remember their iniquities, and he shall avenge  their sins. They [2unto 3Egypt 1returned].

14. And Israel forgot the one making him. And they built sacred precincts, and Judah multiplied cities being walled up. And I will send out fire unto  his cities, and it shall devour  his foundations.  

## Hosea 9

1.  The Iniquities of Israel and Ephraim Rejoice not, O Israel, nor be glad as the peoples! For you went whoring from the lord your God. You loved gifts upon every threshing-floor of grain.

2. The threshing-floor and wine vat did not know them, and the wine lied to them.

3. They did not dwell in the land of the lord; Ephraim dwelt in Egypt, and among the Assyrians [2unclean things 1they shall eat].

4. They offered not a libation to the lord of wine, and were not delicious to him;  their sacrifices were as bread of mourning to them; all the ones eating them shall be defiled. For their bread loaves  for their lives shall not enter into the house of the lord.

5. What will you do in the day of festival, and in the day of the holiday feast of the lord?

6. On account of this, behold, they are gone from the misery of Egypt, and [2shall look out for 3them 1Memphis], and [2shall entomb 3them 1Machmas].  Their silver -- ruin shall inherit it; thorn-bushes in  their tents.

7. [4have come 1The 2days  3of vengeance]; [4have come 1the 2days  3of your recompense]; and Israel shall be afflicted as if the prophet, the one moved out of place, as a man  carried by the wind. Because of the multitude  of your iniquities [2was multiplied 1your frenzy].

8. The watchman of Ephraim was with God; the prophet [2snare 1is a crooked] upon all  his ways; [2frenzy 3in 4the house 5of God 1they firmly fastened].

9. They were corrupted according to the days of the hill. He shall remember their iniquities, he will punish their sins.

10. As a grape in the wilderness I found  Israel; as a fig in [2fig-tree 1the early] I beheld their fathers. They entered to  Baal Peor, and they were separated for shame, and [3became 1the things 2being abhorred] as the things being loved.

11. Ephraim as a bird was spread forth away,  their glory of births and pangs and from conceptions.

12. For if even they should nourish  their children, they shall be made childless of men; for [2even 3a woe 4to them 1there is];  my flesh from them.

13. Ephraim, in which manner I saw, [3as 4game 1rendered  2their children];  to lead out [2for 3piercing  1their children].

14. Give to them, O lord! What will you give to them? Give to them a womb being childless and [2breasts 1dry]!

15. All  their evils are in Gilgal, for there I detested them. Because of the evils  of their practices [3out of  4my house 1I will cast 2them]. No way shall I proceed  to love them. All  their rulers resist persuasion.

16. Ephraim toiled,  his roots were dried, [3fruit 4any longer 1in no way 2should he bear]; therefore if they should bear, I shall kill the desires  of their bellies.

17. [2shall thrust them away  1God], for they hearkened not to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations.  

## Hosea 10

1.  Israel's Sin and Captivity [2is a grapevine 3having good vine branches 1Israel]  her fruit prospering. According to the multitude  of her fruits he multiplied the altars. According to the good things  of his land he built monuments.

2. They portioned their hearts, now they shall be obliterated; he shall raze  their altars, [2shall languish  1their monuments].

3. Because now they shall say, There is no king for us, for we feared not the lord; but the king, what shall he do to us?

4. Speaking words, [2excuses 1lying]; he shall ordain a covenant. [2shall rise 3as 4wild grass 1Judgment] upon an uncultivated field.

5. To the calf of the house of On [4shall sojourn 1the ones 2dwelling 3Samaria]; for [2mourned  1his people] for it; and as they greatly embittered him, they shall rejoice over  his glory, for he was displaced from him.

6. And [2it 3for 4Assyria 1having tied], they carried away tribute  to king Jareb by a gift; Ephraim shall receive shame; Israel shall be ashamed in  his counsel.

7. Samaria threw off her king as a stick upon the face of the water.

8. And [3shall be lifted away 1the shrines 2of On], even the sins  of Israel. Thorn-bushes and thistles shall ascend upon  their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us! and to the hills, Fall upon us!

9. From of which time the hills existed Israel sinned; there they stood. No way should it overtake them in the hill -- war [2upon 3the 4children 5of iniquity 1came].

10.  To correct them -- and [2shall be brought together 1peoples] against them in  their being corrected for  [2two 3iniquities 1their].

11. Ephraim -- a heifer being taught, loving altercation; but I shall come upon the best  of her neck; I will conduct Ephraim; I will pass silently over Judah; [2shall grow in strength 3against him 1Jacob].

12. Sow to yourselves for righteousness! Gather the vintage for the fruit of life! Light for yourselves the light of knowledge! Inquire of the lord until  [3comes 1the offspring 2of righteousness] to you!

13. Why did you pass over [2in silence 1impiety], and  [2of her iniquity 1gathered the vintage]? You ate [2fruit 1false], for you hoped in  your chariots, in the abundance of your power.

14. And [2shall rise up 1destruction] among  your people, and all  your places being walled around shall be undone. As the ruler Shalman departed out of the house of Jeroboam in the days of battle, [2the mother 3upon 4children 1they dashed];

15. so I will do to you, O house  of Israel, in front of your evils.  

## Hosea 11

1.  The LORD's Love for Israel Early they were disowned, [3was disowned 1the king 2of Israel]; for Israel is an infant, and I loved him, and from out of Egypt I called back  his children.

2. As I called them back, so they moved from in front of me; they [2to the 3Baalim 1sacrificed]; and to the carved images they burned incense.

3. And I bound  Ephraim; I took him upon  my arm; and they knew not that I have healed them.

4. In corruption of men I stretched them with the bonds of my affections. And I will be to them as [2slapping 1a man] upon  his cheek; and I shall look to him; I will prevail to him.

5. Ephraim dwelt in Egypt, and Assyria he was his king, for he did not want to return.

6. And he weakened by the broadsword in  his cities, and he rested with  his hands; and they shall eat of  their own deliberations.

7. And  his people are hanging from the thing of his house; and  God [2against  3his esteemed 1shall be enraged], and in no way should he exalt him.

8. How shall I deal with you, O Ephraim? Shall I shield you, O Israel? How shall I deal with you -- as Admah? Shall I appoint you even as Zeboim? [2shall be converted  1My heart] in the same thing; [2was disturbed  1my repentance].

9. No way shall I act according to the anger  of my rage. No way should I abandon  Ephraim to be wiped away. Because  [3God 1I 2am], and not man; [2among 3you 1the holy one], and I will not enter into the city.

10. [2after 3the lord 1I shall go]; as a lion he shall bellow; for he shall roar, and [3shall be startled 1children 2of the waters].

11. They shall be startled as a bird from out of Egypt, and as a dove from out of the land of the Assyrians; and I will restore them unto  their houses, says the lord.

12. [2encircled 3me 4with 5a lie 1Ephraim], and [5with 6impious deeds 1the house 2of Israel 3and 4Judah]; but now [2knew 3them  1God], and [3people 2a holy 1they shall be called] of God.  

## Hosea 12

1.  The Case against Ephraim and Judah  But Ephraim is an evil spirit. He pursued the burning wind the entire  day. [2empty 3and 4vain things 1He multiplied]. And [2a covenant 3with 4the Assyrians 1he ordained], and [2olive oil 3in 4Egypt 1traded].

2. And there is a case with the lord against Judah,  to punish  Jacob; according to  his ways and according to  his practices he will recompense to him.

3. In the belly he caught the heel  of his brother; and in his toils he grew in strength with God.

4. And he grew in strength with the angel, and he prevailed; they wept and beseeched me; in the house of On they found me. There it was spoken to them.

5. But the lord  God  almighty will be his memorial.

6. And you [2to 3your God 1shall return]; [2mercy 3and 4judgment 1guard], and approach to  your God always!

7. Canaan, in his hand is a yoke of iniquity; [2to tyrannize 1he loved].

8. And Ephraim said, But I am rich, I have found respite for myself. All  produce of his toils shall not be found in him, because of iniquities in which he sinned.

9. But I, the lord  your God, led you out of the land of Egypt; still I will settle you in tents as in the days of the holiday feast.

10. And I will speak by prophets, and I [2visions 1multiplied], and by the hands of prophets I was likened.

11. If [3not 1Gilgal 2is], then even [6false 5were 3in 4Gilgal 1rulers 2sacrificing], and  their altars are as tortoise like heaps upon an uncultivated field.

12. And Jacob withdrew into the plain of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep.

13. And by a prophet the lord led  Israel from out of the land of Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded.

14. Ephraim was enraged and provoked to anger, therefore  his blood [2upon 3him 1shall be poured out], and  [5scorning 4his 2shall recompense 1the lord 3to him].  

## Hosea 13

1.  Rejection and Renewal According to the word Ephraim [2ordinances 1conceived] himself in Israel, and appointed  to Baal, and died.

2. And now they proceeded  to sin, and made for themselves molten castings of  their silver, according to the image of idols, the works of fabricators being completed for them. They say, Sacrifice men, for the calves have ceased!

3. On account of this, they will be as [2cloud 1an early morning], and as [2dew 1early morning] going away, as dust being blown away from the threshing floor, and as a vapor from tears.

4. But I the lord  your God, I led you from out of the land of Egypt, and [2a god 3besides 4me 1you shall not know], and [2one delivering 1there is not] besides me.

5. I tended you in the wilderness in [2land 1an uninhabited].

6. According to  their pastures, so they were filled unto fullness, and they exalted  their hearts; because of this they forgot me.

7. And I will be to them as a panther, and as a leopard, according to the way of the Assyrians.

8. I will meet them as a bear  being perplexed, and I will tear up the enclosure of their heart; and [3shall devour 4them 5there 1the cubs 2of the forest]; and wild beasts of the field shall pull them apart.

9.  In your corruption, O Israel, who will help?

10. Where is  this your king? and let him preserve you in all  your cities! Let him judge you! whom you said, Give to me a king and a ruler!

11. And I gave to you a king in my anger, and I sufficed in  my rage.

12. A confederacy of injustice; Ephraim -- [2being hidden 1his sin].

13. Pangs as one giving birth shall come to him; he is  [3son 1your  2intelligent], because now in no way should he stand in the destruction of children.

14. From the hand of Hades I shall rescue them; from death I will ransom them. Where is  your punishment, O death? Where is  your sting, O Hades? Consolation is hidden from my eyes.

15. For this, [2between 3brethren 1he will separate]; [2will bring up 3a burning 4wind 1the lord] from out of the wilderness upon him, and he shall dry up  his arteries; he shall make quite desolate  his springs; he shall totally dry up  his land, and all  [2items  1his desirable].

16. Samaria shall be obliterated, for she withstood against her God. By the broadsword they shall fall, and the ones under their breasts shall be dashed, and the ones [3in the 4womb 2having one 1of them] shall be torn up.  

## Hosea 14

1.  Judgment against Samaria Return, O Israel, to the lord  your God! for you are weakened by  your iniquities.

2. Take after your own words, and return to the lord! Speak to him! so that you should not receive for your iniquities, and so that you should receive good things, and we will recompense the fruit of our lips.

3. Assyria in no way shall deliver us; upon a horse we shall not ascend; no longer in any way should we say, Our gods -- to the works  of our hands. The one among you shall show mercy on the orphan. 

4.  Restoration of Israel I will repair  their dwellings; I will love them confessedly, for [2turned away 1my anger] from them;

5. and I will be as dew to Israel; he shall bloom as a lily, and shall cast  his roots as  Lebanon.

6. [2shall go forth  1His branches], and he will be as [2olive 1a fruitful], and  his smell as Lebanon.

7. They shall return and sit under  his protection; they shall live and shall be fixed firmly in grain, and they shall blossom as a grapevine. The memorial of him is as the wine of Lebanon.

8. To Ephraim, what is there to him yet and to idols? I humbled him, and I shall strengthen him. I am as a juniper being dense. From me  your fruit has been found.

9. Who is wise, and perceives these things? discerning, and recognizes them? For straight are the ways of the lord, and the just shall go by them; but the impious shall weaken in them.
