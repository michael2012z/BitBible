1.  The Death of Ahaziah And Moab annulled allegiance with Israel after the dying of Ahab.

2. And Ahaziah fell through the lattice  in  his upper room,  in Samaria, and was infirm. And he sent for messengers, and he said to them, Go and ask of  Baal the fly god of Ekron if I shall live through  [3infirmity 2my 1this]! And they went to ask.

3. And an angel of the lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Rise up, go to meet the messengers of Ahaziah king of Samaria! and say to them, Is it on account of the not being a God in Israel you go to ask of  Baal the fly god of Ekron?

4. On account of this thus says the lord, The bed upon which you ascended upon it, you shall not go from it, for to death you shall die. And Elijah went, and spoke to them.

5. And [3returned 1the 2messengers] to him. And he said to them, Why is it that you have returned?

6. And they said to him, A man ascended to meet us, and he said to us, Go, return to the king, the one sending you, and say to him! Thus says the lord, Is it because  there is no God in Israel you go to seek anxiously by  Baal the fly god of Ekron? On account of this, the bed upon which you ascended upon it, you shall not go from it, for to death you shall die.

7. And [3said 4to them 1the 2king], What was the distinguishing mark of the man  ascending to meet you, and speaking to you  these words?

8. And they said to him, [2man 1He was a hairy], and a belt made of skin was girded upon  his loin. And he said, [2Elijah 3the 4Tishbite 1This is]. 

9.  Elijah Sends Fire And he sent to him a commander of fifty, and  his fifty. And he ascended to him. And he sat upon the top of the mountain. And [3spoke 1the 2commander of fifty] to him, O man  of God, the king calls you, come down!

10. And Elijah answered and said to the commander of fifty, And if [2a man  3of God 1I am], [2shall come down 1fire] from  heaven and shall devour you and  your fifty. And there came down fire from  heaven, and devoured him and  his fifty.

11. And [3proceeded 1the 2king], and he sent to him another commander of fifty, and  his fifty. And [3ascended 1the 2commander of fifty] and spoke to him, and said, O man  of God, thus says the king, Quickly come down!

12. And Elijah answered and said to him, If [2a man  3of God 1I am], [2shall come down 1fire] from  heaven, and shall devour you and  your fifty. And there came down fire from  heaven and devoured him and  his fifty.

13. And [3proceeded 1the 2king] again to send [2commander of fifty 1a third] and  his fifty. And [4came 1the 3commander of fifty  2third], and he bent upon  his knees in front of  Elijah, and beseeched him, and spoke to him, and said, O man  of God, value indeed  my life, and the lives  of your servants -- these  fifty, in your eyes!

14. Behold, there came down fire from the heaven, and devoured the [2two 3commanders of fifties  1first] and  their fifties. And now value indeed the life  of your servants in your eyes!

15. And [3said 1the angel 2of the lord] to Elijah, Go down with him, you should not fear from their presence. And Elijah rose up and went down with them to the king.

16. And he said to him, Thus says the lord, Because you sent messengers to ask to  Baal the fly god of Ekron, as if there was not a God in Israel  to ask the word of him, on account of this the bed upon which you ascended upon it, you shall not go down from it, for in death you shall die. 

17.  Jehoram Reigns over Israel And he died according to the saying of the lord which Elijah spoke. And [5reigned 1Jehoram 2the 3brother 4of Ahaziah] instead of him, (for there was no son to him) in the [2year  1second] of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.

18. And the rest of the words of Ahaziah, as many things as he did, behold are not these written in the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?

3. And [7came 1the 2sons 3of the 4prophets  5in 6Bethel] to Elisha, and they said to him, Do you know that the lord today takes  your master above  your head? And he said, Indeed even I knew, keep silent!

7. And fifty men from the sons of the prophets came, and they stood right opposite far off. And both stood at the Jordan.

9.  Elisha Asks for a Double Portion And it came to pass, in  their passing over, Elijah said to Elisha, Ask! what I shall do for you before  my being taken up from you. And Elisha said, Let there be indeed a double  of your spirit upon me!

13. And he raised up high the sheepskin of Elijah which fell on top of him. And Elisha turned, and stood upon the edge of the Jordan.

14. And he took the sheepskin of Elijah, which fell on top of him, and he struck the waters, and said, Where is the God of Elijah now? And he struck the waters, and they tore apart here and there; and Elisha passed over.

15. And [5beheld 6him 1the 2sons 3of the 4prophets], the ones in Jericho right opposite. And they said, [4rests 1The 2spirit 3of Elijah] upon Elisha. And they came to meet with him, and they did obeisance to him upon the ground.

16. And they said to him, Behold indeed, there are with  your servants fifty men, sons of power. In going indeed, let them seek  your master! lest at some time [3lifted 4him 1spirit 2of the lord], and tossed him in the mountains, or upon one of the hills. And Elisha said, You shall not send.

17. And they pressed him until he was shamed. And he said, Send them! And they sent fifty men; and they sought three days, and they did not find him.

18. And they returned to him. And he stayed in Jericho. And he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go? 

19.  Elisha Heals the Water And [5said 1the 2men 3of the 4city] to Elisha, Behold now, the site of the city is good, as you, O master, see; but the waters are bad, and the ground being barren.

20. And Elisha said, Bring to me [2water-pot 1a new], and cast salt there! And they took it to him.

21. And he went forth unto the outlet of the waters, and he tossed there the salt. And he said, Thus says the lord, I have healed  these waters, there will not be any longer there death and being barren.

22. And [3were healed 1the 2waters] until  this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.

23. And he ascended from there unto Bethel. And in his ascending in the way, that [2boys 1small] came forth from out of the city, and they mocked him, and said to him, Ascend, bald one! Ascend, bald one!

24. And he turned behind him, and beheld them, and cursed them in the name of the lord. And [3came forth 1two 2bears] from out of the forest, and they tore asunder of them forty and two children.

8. And he said, What way shall we ascend? And he said, The way of the wilderness of Edom.

9. And [4went 1the 2king 3of Israel], and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom. And they encircled a journey of seven days. And there was no water for the camp, and for the cattle, the ones at  their feet.

10. And [4said 1the 2king 3of Israel], O that the lord called  [2three 3kings 1these] to deliver them up into the hand of Moab.

11. And Jehoshaphat said to him, Is there not here a prophet of the lord, that we should seek anxiously the lord by him? And answered one of the servants of the king of Israel, and said, [4is here 1Elisha 2son 3of Shaphat], who poured water upon the hands of Elijah.

12. And Jehoshaphat said, [3is 4with 5him 1The word 2of the lord]. And [3went down 4to 5him 1the king 2of Israel], and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and the king of Edom.

13. And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What is there between me and you? Go to the prophets  of your father, and to the prophets  of your mother. And [4said 5to him 1the 2king 3of Israel], Is it that the lord calls  [2three 3kings 1these]  to deliver them into the hands of Moab? 

14.  Moab Defeated by the Kings And Elisha said, As [4lives 1the lord 2of the 3forces], in whom I stand before him, that if it were not the face  of Jehoshaphat king of Judah which I receive, shall I have looked upon you or beheld you, no.

15. And now bring to me one for strumming! And it came to pass as [3strummed 1the 2one strumming], that [3came 4upon 5him 1the hand 2of the lord].

16. And he said, Thus says the lord, Make  this dry stream cistern upon cistern.

17. For thus says the lord, You shall not see wind, and you shall not see rain; but  this dry stream shall be filled with water, and you shall drink, you and  your possessions, and  your cattle.

18. But it is a light thing in the eyes of the lord. And I will deliver up  Moab into your hands.

19. And you shall strike every [2city 1fortified], and every [2city 1choice]; and every [2tree 1good] you shall throw down, and all springs of water you shall obstruct, and every [2portion of land 1good] you shall make useless with stones.

20. And it came to pass in the morning of the ascending of the sacrifice, that behold, waters came from out of the way of Edom, and [3was filled 1the 2earth] of the waters.

21. And all Moab heard that [3ascended 1the 2kings] to wage war against them, and they yelled out from all sides girding on the belt, and went forward, and they stood at the border.

22. And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the waters. And Moab beheld the waters right opposite fiery red as blood.

23. And they said, This is blood of a broadsword. [3did combat 1The 2kings], and [3struck 1each 2man]  his neighbor. And now, [3are for 1the 2spoils] Moab.

25. And [2the 3cities 1they demolished], and every [2portion of land 1good] [2tossed 1each man]  his stone, and they filled it. And every spring of water they obstructed, and every [2tree 1good] they threw down unto  leaving behind the stones of the wall being demolished. And [3encircled 1the 2slingers] and struck it.

26. And [4beheld 1the 2king 3of Moab] that [3overpowered 4him 1the 2battle]; and he took with himself seven hundred men unsheathing the broadsword to cut through the king of Edom; but they were not able.

27. And he took  [3son 1his  2first-born] whom he gave reign instead of him, and offered him as a whole burnt-offering upon the wall. And came to pass [2repentance 1a great] in Israel. And they departed from him, and they returned to the land.

2. And Elisha said to her, What should I do for you, announce it to me? What is there to you in the house?  And she said, There is not to your maidservant one thing in the house, only a vessel of olive oil in the house which I anoint with.

3. And he said to her, Go ask for yourself vessels from outside, from all  your neighbors, [2vessels 1empty], not a few.

9. And [3said 1the 2woman] to  her husband, Behold indeed, I know that [2man  3of God 1this is a holy], who travels unto us continually.

10. We should indeed make for him [2upper room 1a small], and we should put for him there a bed, and a table, and a chair, and a lamp-stand. And it will be in  his coming to us, that he shall turn aside there.

11. And [2came 1a day], and he entered there, and he turned aside into the upper room, and went to bed there.

12. And he said to Gehazi  his servant, Call  this Shunammite! And he called her, and she stood before him.

13. And he said to him, Say indeed to her, Behold, you startled us all  with this change of state, what shall we do for you? Is there to you a word to say to the king, or to the ruler of the force?  And she said, [3in 4the midst  5of my people 1I 2dwell].

14. And he said to Gehazi, What must be done for her? And Gehazi said, That by all means a son is not to her, and  her husband is old.

15. And he said, Call her! And he called her, and she stood by the door.

16. And Elisha said to her, At  this time next year, about  this hour, and living, you shall be holding a son.  But she said, No, O master, O man  of God, you should not disappoint  your maidservant.

17. And [3conceived 1the 2woman], and bore a son at  this same time about the same hour living, as [2spoke 3to 4her 1Elisha].

21. And she bore him, and rested him upon the bed of the man  of God, and locked after him, and went forth.

22. And she called  her husband, and said, Send indeed for me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, and I shall run unto the man  of God, and I shall return.

23. And he said, Why is it that you should go to him today? It is not a new moon nor a Sabbath.  And she said, Peace.

24. And she saddled the donkey, and said to her servant, You lead, and go! Do not wait for me  to mount. For if I said to you, Go, then you shall go and shall come to the man  of God in mount  Carmel.

25. And she went, and came unto the man  of God in the mountain. And it came to pass as [4saw 5her 1the 2man  3of God] right opposite, that he said to Gehazi, to his servant, Behold,  that Shunammite.

26. Now run to meet her! and you shall say to her, Is peace to you? Is peace to your husband? Is peace to the boy? And she said, Peace.

27. And she straightened to the man  of God in the mountain, and she seized  his feet. And Gehazi approached to thrust her away, and [4said 5to 6him 1the 2man  3of God], Allow her! for  her soul pains her, and the lord concealed it from me, and announced it not to me.

28. And she said, Did I ask a son from  my master? Did I not say, Do not mislead with me?

29. And Elisha said  to Gehazi, Tie up  your loin, and take  my staff in  your hand and go! And if you should find a man in the way, you shall not bless him; and if [2should bless 3you 1a man], you shall not answer him; and you shall place  my staff upon the face of the boy.

30. And [5said 1the 2mother 3of the 4boy], As the lord lives, and as [2lives  1your soul], shall I leave you behind, no. And Elisha rose up, and went after her. 

31.  Elisha Raises the Shunammite Woman's Son And Gehazi went in front of them, and he placed the staff upon the face of the boy; and there was no sound, and there was no hearing. And he returned to meet him, and he reported to him, saying, [3was not arisen 1the 2boy].

32. And Elisha entered into the house, and behold, the boy having died was resting upon  his bed.

33. And Elisha entered, and locked the door after the two of them. And he prayed to the lord.

34. And he ascended, and bedded down upon the boy, and put  his mouth upon  his mouth, and  his eyes upon  his eyes, and  his hands upon  his hands. And he bent upon him, and warmed the flesh of the boy.

35. And he returned, and went about the house this side and that side, and he ascended, and bent downwards upon the boy for seven times. And [3opened 1the 2boy]  his eyes.

36. And Elisha yelled out loud to Gehazi, and said, Call  this Shunammite! And he called her, and she entered to him. And Elisha said, Receive  your son!

37. And [3entered 1the 2woman], and fell at  his feet, and did obeisance upon the ground, and took  her son, and went forth. 

38.  Elisha Cures the Kettle of Stew And Elisha returned to Gilgal. And the famine was in the land. And the sons of the prophets sat down before him. And Elisha said to his servant, Stand by the [2kettle  1great], and boil stew for the sons of the prophets!

39. And he went forth into the field to collect together herbs. And he found a vine in the field, and he collected together from it [2gourd 1a wild] to fill  his cloak, and he entered and put it into the kettle of the stew -- but they did not know.

40. And he poured out to the men to eat. And it came to pass in  their eating from the stew, that they yelled out and said, Death is in the kettle, O man  of God. And they were not able to eat.

41. And he said, You take flour, and put it in the kettle! And they put. And Elisha said to Gehazi, Pour out to the people, and let them eat! And there was not [2thing 1a bad] still in the kettle.

42. And a man came from out of Baal-shalisha, and he brought to the man  of God first produce of twenty bread loaves of barley, and dried clusters of figs. And he said, Give them to the people, and let them eat!

43. And [2said  1his minister], What, should I give before [2hundred 3men 1this]? And he said, Give to the people, and let them eat! for thus says the lord, They shall eat, and shall leave over.

44. And they ate, and left behind according to the saying of the lord.

5. And [4said 1the 2king 3of Syria], Come, enter! and I will send out a scroll to the king of Israel. And he went and took in  his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of apparels.

6. And he brought the scroll to the king of Israel, saying, And now when ever [3should come  2scroll 1this] to you, behold, I sent to you Naaman  my servant, and you shall cure him from  his leprosy.

7. And it came to pass as [4read 1the 2king 3of Israel] the scroll, that he tore  his garments, and said, Am I God, the one putting to death and restoring to life, that this one sends to me to cure a man from  his leprosy? For besides, you know and see that this one makes an excuse towards me.

8. And it came to pass as [4heard 1Elisha 2the man  3of God] that [3tore 1the 2king]  his garments, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, Why do you tear  your garments? Let [3come 1indeed 4to 5me 2Naaman]! and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

13. And [2approached  1his servants], and they said to him, If [4a great 5word 3spoke 1the 2prophet] to you, would you not have done in so far as he said to you? Bathe and be cleansed! 

14.  Naaman Immerses in the Jordan And Naaman went down, and he immersed in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man  of God. And [2returned  1his flesh] as the flesh [2boy 1of a small], and he was cleansed.

16. And Elisha said, As the lord lives in whom I stand before him, shall I take it? And he pressed him to take, but he resisted persuasion.

17. And Naaman said, And if not, let there be given indeed to your servant a cargo team of mules of earth, for [2shall not offer 3any longer  1your servant] a whole burnt-offering and sacrifice [2gods 1to other]; but only to the lord alone.

18. And concerning  this matter, [2shall deal kindly 3with me 1the lord], to your servant in the entering  of my master into the house of Rimmon to do obeisance there, for he shall rest upon  my hand. And I shall do obeisance in the house of Rimmon, in  his doing obeisance in the house of Rimmon. And [2shall deal kindly 3with me 1the lord] to your servant over  this matter.

19. And Elisha said to Naaman, Go in peace! And he went forth from him into Havratha the land.

20. And [2said 1Gehazi], the servant of Elisha the man  of God, Behold, [2spared  1my master]  Naaman  this Syrian,  so as to not take from his hand of what he brought. As lives the lord, that I shall run after him, and I shall take something from him.

21. And Gehazi pursued after  Naaman. And [2saw 3him 1Naaman] running after him, and he leaped down from the chariot for meeting him. And he said, Peace.

22. And Gehazi said, Peace.  My master has sent me, saying, Behold, now there came to me two young men from out of mount Ephraim, from the sons of the prophets. Give indeed to them a talent of silver and two changes of apparel!

23. And Naaman said, Take two talents of silver! And he forced him, and he took to him two talents of silver in two purses, and two changes of apparel. And he gave unto [2two 3servants 1his], and they carried them in front of him.

26. And [2said 3to 4him 1Elisha], Did not  my heart go with you when [3turned 1the 2man] from  his chariot for meeting you? And now, you took the silver, and the garments, and you shall take with it gardens, and olive groves, and vineyards, and flocks, and herds, and bondmen and bondwomen.

27. And the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to you, and among  your seed into the eon. And he went forth from his face being leprous as snow.  

## 2 Kings 6

7. And he said, Raise it to yourself! And he stretched out  his hand and took it. 

8.  War with Syria And the king of Syria was waging war against Israel. And he consulted with  his servants, saying, In the place thus [2in a certain 3concealed place 1I will camp].

9. And [4sent 1the 2man  3of God] to the king of Israel, saying, Guard to not go by  this place, for there Syria hides.

10. And [4sent 1the 2king 3of Israel] to the place which [4told 5him 1the 2man  3of God]. And he guarded from there not once nor twice.

11. And [6was startled 1the 2soul 3of the 4king 5of Syria] on account of  this word. And he called  his servants, and he said to them, Shall you not announce to me who betrays me to the king of Israel?

12. And [3said 1one  2of his servants], Not so, O my master, O king. For Elisha the prophet, the one in Israel, he announces to the king of Israel all the words which ever you should speak in the closet  of your bedroom.

13. And he said, Go, and see where this one is! and sending I will take him. And they reported to him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

14. And he sent horses and chariots, and [2force 1a heavy]. And they came at night, and surrounded the city.

15. And [7early 1the 2minister 3of the 4man  5of God 6rose up], and went forth. And behold, the force was encircling the city, and with horses and chariots. And [2said  1his servant] to him, O master, what shall we do?

16. And Elisha said, Do not fear, for many are the ones with us over the ones with them.

17. And Elisha prayed, and said, O lord, open  his eyes, and let him see! And the lord opened wide the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses, and a chariot of fire surrounding Elisha. 

18.  The Syrians are Struck with Blindness And they came down to him. And Elisha prayed to the lord, and said, Strike indeed  this nation with inability to see! And he struck them with inability to see, according to the saying of Elisha.

19. And Elisha said to them, This is not the city, and this is not the way. Come after me! and I will lead you to the man whom you seek. And he took them to Samaria.

20. And it came to pass, as he entered into Samaria, that Elisha said, O lord, open the eyes of these, and let them see! And the lord opened wide  their eyes, and they saw. And behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.

21. And [4said 1the 2king 3of Israel] to Elisha, as he beheld them, Shall by striking, I strike them, O father?

22. And he said, You shall not strike. Whom you captured by your broadsword, and your bow you shall strike. Place bread loaves and water before them, and let them eat and let them drink and let them go forth to  their master!

23. And he placed for them [2fete 1a great]. And they ate, and drank, and he sent them. And they went forth to  their master. And [3did not proceed 4still 1the armed bands 2of Syrians]  to come into the land of Israel. 

24.  Siege and Famine in Samaria And it came to pass after these things, that [5gathered 1the son 2of Hadad 3king 4of Syria] all  his camp, and ascended, and besieged against Samaria.

25. And there was [2famine 1a great] in Samaria. And behold, they laid siege against it until of which [3was worth 1the head 2of a donkey] eighty shekels of silver; and a fourth  of a cab [2dung 1of doves] five shekels of silver.

26. And [4was 1the 2king 3of Israel] traveling upon the wall. And a woman yelled to him, saying, Deliver us, O master, O king!

27. And he said to her, Unless [2delivers you 1the lord], from what place shall I deliver you -- from the threshing-floor or from the wine vat?

28. And [3said 4to her 1the 2king], What is it with you? And she said,  This woman said to me, Give  your son! and we shall eat him today, and  my son we shall eat tomorrow.

29. And we boiled  my son, and we ate him. And I said to her the [2day  1other], Give  your son! for we should eat him. And she hid  her son.

30. And it came to pass as [3heard 1the 2king] the words of the woman, he tore  his garments, and he traveled over upon the wall. And [3saw 1the 2people] the sackcloth upon  his flesh inside.

31. And he said, Thus [2do 3to me  1God], and thus add more, if [6shall stand 1the 2head 3of Elisha 4son 5of Shaphat] upon him today.

32. And Elisha was sitting down in  his house, and the elders were sitting down with him. And the king sent a man before his face. But before the coming of the messenger to him, that Elisha himself said to the elders, Do you see that [4sent  2son  3of a murderer 1this] to remove  my head? Know as when [3should come 1the 2messenger], you lock the door, and press against him on the door! Is not the sound of the feet  of his master right after him?

33. While he was speaking with them, that behold, the messenger came to him. And he said, Behold, this  evil is from the lord, why remain behind for the lord any longer?  

## 2 Kings 7

1.  The Syrian Army Abandons Camp And Elisha said, Hear the word of the lord! Thus says the lord, At  this same hour tomorrow, a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.

2. And [3responded 1the 2tribune] (upon whom the king rested upon  his hand) to the man  of God, and he said, And if the lord should make a torrent in the heaven, shall [2be  1this thing], no. And Elisha said, Behold, you shall see with your eyes, but [3from there 1you shall not 2eat].

3. And four men, lepers, were by the door of the city. And said one man to  his neighbor, Why do we sit here until we die?

4. If we should say, We should enter into the city, and the famine is in the city, then we shall die there. And if we sit here, then we shall die. And now, come, and we shall fall into the camp of Syria. If they should bring us forth alive, then we shall live. And if they should kill us, then we shall die.

5. And they rose up in the darkness to enter into the camp of Syria. And they entered unto a part of the camp of Syria. And behold, there was not a man there.

6. For the lord [2audible 1made] in the camp of Syria a sound of chariots, and a sound of horses, and a sound [2force 1of a great]. And [2said 1each man] to  his neighbor, Behold, [4has hired 5against 6us 1the 2king 3of Israel] the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Egypt,  to come against us.

7. And they rose up, and ran away in the darkness. And they abandoned  their tents, and  their horses, and  their donkeys, as was in the camp; and they fled for  their lives.

8. And [2came  1these lepers] unto a part of the camp. And they entered into [2tent 1one], and ate, and drank, and lifted from there silver, and gold, and clothes, and they went and hid everything. And they returned and entered into [2tent 1another], and they took from there, and went and hid them.

9. And said one man to  his neighbor, [2not 3thus 1We are] doing right.  This day [2a day 3of good news 1is], and we keep silent, and are waiting until light of the morning, and we shall find iniquity. Now then, come, we should go and announce to the house of the king.

10. And they entered and yelled by the gate of the city. And they announced to them, saying, We entered into the camp of Syria, and behold, there is not there a man nor a voice of a man, but only a horse being tied and a donkey being tied, and their tents as they are.

11. And they called the doorkeepers. And they announce to the house of the king inside.

12. And [3rose up 1the 2king] in the night, and said to his servants, I shall report indeed to you what [3have done 4to us 1the 2Syrians]. They know that we hunger, and they went forth from out of the camp, to hide in a field, saying, They shall come forth from out of the city, and we shall seize them alive, and we shall enter into the city.

13. And answered one  of his servants, and said, Let them take indeed five of the horses, of the ones being left behind, which they left behind here. Behold, they are for all the multitude of Israel  faltering; for we will send there and see.

14. And they took two riders of horses; and [4sent them 1the 2king 3of Israel] after  Syria, saying, Go and see!

15. And they went after them unto the Jordan. And behold, all the way was full of clothes and items, which the Syrians tossed in  their being distraught. And [3returned 1the 2messengers], and announced to the king.

16. And [3came forth 1the 2people], and they tore in pieces the camp of Syria. And [3became worth 1a measure 2of fine flour] a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the saying of the lord.

17. And the king placed the tribune (upon whom the king rested upon  his hand) over the gate. And [3trampled 4him 1the 2people] at the gate, and he died as [4said 1the 2man  3of God], who spoke with the [2coming down  1messenger] to him.

18. And it came to pass as Elisha said to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, and it will be at this hour tomorrow at the gate of Samaria.

19. And [3answered 1the 2tribune] to the man  of God, and said, And if the lord should make a torrent in the heaven, shall [2be  1this thing], no. And [4said 1the 2man  3of God] Behold, you will see with your eyes, but from there you will not eat.

20. And it came to pass so; and [3trampled 4him 1the 2people] in the gate, and he died.  

## 2 Kings 8

1.  Famine in the Land And Elisha spoke to the woman of whom [3was enlivened 1the 2son], saying, Rise up and go, you and  your household, and sojourn of which ever place you should want to sojourn! for the lord has called a famine upon the land; and it will be at hand upon the land for seven years.

2. And [3rose up 1the 2woman], and did according to the saying of the man  of God. And she went and  her household, and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years.

3. And it came to pass after the end of the seven years, that [3returned 1the 2woman] from out of the land of the philistines. And she went to yell to the king on account of  her house, and on account of  her fields.

4. And the king spoke to Gehazi the servant of Elisha, the man  of God, saying, Describe indeed to me! all the great things which Elisha did.

5. And it came to pass, of his describing to the king of how he enlivened the son having died, that behold, the woman of whom he enlivened  her son came yelling to the king concerning  her house and concerning  her fields. And Gehazi said, O master, O king, this is the woman, and this is  her son whom Elisha enlivened.

6. And [3asked 1the 2king] the woman, and she described to him. And [3appointed 4to her 1the 2king 6eunuch 5one], saying, Return all the things of hers, and all the offspring  of her field from the day of which she left the land until the present.

7. And Elisha came unto Damascus. And the son of Hadad king of Syria was infirm. And they announced to him, saying, [4comes 1The 2man  3of God] unto here.

8. And [3said 1the 2king] to Hazael, Take in  your hand a gift, and go for a meeting with the man  of God, and seek anxiously  of the lord through him, saying, Shall I live from out of  [2my illness 1this]?

9. And Hazael went to meet him, and he took a gift in  his hand of all the good things of Damascus, a tribute of forty camels. And he came and stood before him, and said,  Your son, the son of Hadad king of Syria sent me to you, saying, Shall I live from out of  [2my illness 1this]?

10. And [2said 3to 4him 1Elisha], Go, say to him, To life you shall live! But [2showed 3to me 1the lord] that to death he shall die.

11. And Hazael stood in front of him, and he placed before him the gifts until he was ashamed. And [4wept 1the 2man  3of God]. 

12.  Elisha Prophecies Hazael's Atrocities And Hazael said, Why is it that  my master weeps? And he said that, I have beheld as many things as you shall do to the sons of Israel -- bad things.  [2their fortresses 1You will send] up in fire, and  their chosen ones you will kill by broadsword, and  their infants you shall dash, and the ones [3one in 4the womb 2having 1of them] you shall tear apart.

13. And Hazael said, What is  your servant, the dog  having died, that he will do  [2thing  1this great]? And Elisha said, [2showed 3to me 1The lord] you reigning over Syria.

14. And he went forth from Elisha, and came to  his master. And he said to him, What said Elisha to you? And he said, He said to me, To life you shall live.

15. And it came to pass in the next day, and he took  a rag, and he dipped it in  water, and put it upon  his face, and he died. And Hazael reigned instead of him.

18. And he went in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for the daughter of Ahab was his  wife. And he did the wicked thing before the lord.

19. And [2did not 3want 1the lord] to corrupt  Judah because of David  his servant; as he said to give to him the lamp and to his sons all the days.

20. In  his days Edom annulled allegiance from beneath the hand of Judah, and they gave reign to [2over 3themselves 1a king].

21. And Jehoram ascended into Zair, and all the chariots  with him. And it happened as he rose up at night, that he struck  Edom circling upon him, and the commanders of the chariots. And [3fled 1the 2people] to  its tents.

22. But Edom annulled allegiance from beneath the hand of Judah until  this day. Then Libnah annulled allegiance in  that time.

23. And the rest of the words of Jehoram, and all as much as he did, behold are not these written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 9

1.  Jehu is Anointed King And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him, Tie up  your loin, and take the flask  of this oil in  your hand, and be gone unto Ramoth Gilead!

2. And you shall enter there, and you shall see there Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi. And you shall enter, and you shall raise him from the midst  of his brethren. And you shall bring him into the closet of a storeroom.

3. And you shall take the flask of the oil, and you shall pour upon  his head. And you shall say, Thus says the lord, I have anointed you for king over Israel. And you shall open the door, and shall flee, and not wait.

4. And [4went 1the 2young  3prophet] unto Ramoth Gilead.

5. And he entered. And behold, the commanders of the force were sitting down. And he said, A word from me to you,  commander. And Jehu said, To whom of all of us? And he said, To you,  commander.

6. And he rose up, and entered into the house. And he poured the oil upon  his head. And he said to him, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, I have anointed you for king over the people of the lord, over  Israel.

7. And you shall utterly destroy the house of Ahab  your master from my face, and you shall avenge the blood  of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the lord. at the hand of Jezebel,

8. and by the hand of the entire house of Ahab. And you shall utterly destroy to Ahab the ones urinating against a wall, and the one being held and the one left free in Israel.

9. And I will appoint the house of Ahab as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.

10. And  [3shall eat Jezebel 1the 2dogs] in the part of Jezreel, and there shall not be one burying her. And he opened the door, and fled.

11. And Jehu came forth to the servants  of his master, and they said to him, Peace? What is it that [3entered  2overcome by convulsions 1this one] to you? And he said to them, You know the man, and  his meditation.

12. And they said, That's unjust, but announce to us! And he said to them, Such and such he said to me, saying, Thus says the lord, I anoint you for king over Israel.

13. And hearing, they hastened, and [2took 1each]  his cloak, and put them under him upon the frame of the stairs. And they trumped with the horn, and said, Jehu reigns.

14. And [6confederated 1Jehu 2son 3of Jehoshaphat 4son 5of Nimshi] against Jehoram. And Jehoram guarded in Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel before Hazael king of Syria.

15. And [4returned 1Jehoram 2the 3king] to be treated medically in Jezreel from the wounds which [3hit 4him 1the 2Syrians] in  his waging war against Hazael king of Syria. And Jehu said, If [2is 1your soul] with me, let there not go forth out of the city any one escaping  to go and report in Jezreel.

16. And [2rode 3and 4went 1Jehu] unto Jezreel, for Jehoram was being attended to in  Jezreel. And Ahaziah king of Judah came down to see  Jehoram.

17. And the watchman was standing upon the tower in Jezreel. And he beheld the cloud of dust of the multitude of Jehu in  his coming. And he said, [3a cloud of dust 4of the 5multitude 1I 2see]. And Jehoram said, Take a rider, and send for meeting them! and let him say, Is it peace?

18. And [3went 1the 2rider] upon the horse for meeting him. And he said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What is it to you and peace? You turn to the ones behind me! And [3reported 1the 2watchman], saying, [3came 1The 2messenger] unto them, and returned not.

19. And he sent [2rider 3of a horse 1a second]. And he came to them, and he said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What is it to you and peace? You turn to the ones behind me!

20. And [3reported 1the 2watchman], saying, He came unto them and returned not. And the leader is as the leader Jehu son of Nimshi; for [2in 3a frenzy 1he is].

21. And Jehoram said, Team up chariots! And they teamed up. And [4went forth 1Jehoram 2king 3of Israel], and Ahaziah king of Judah, each man in  his chariot. And they came forth for meeting Jehu. And they found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. 

22.  Jehu Kills Jehoram And it came to pass as Jehoram beheld  Jehu, that he said, Is it peace Jehu? And Jehu said, What is it to you and peace with still the harlotries of Jezebel  your mother and  [3potions 1her  2many]?

23. And Jehoram turned  his hands  to flee. And he said to Ahaziah, Treachery Ahaziah.

24. And Jehu filled  his hand with the bow, and he struck  Jehoram between  his arms, and came forth the arrow through  his heart, and he bent upon  his knees.

25. And Jehu said to Bidkar  his tribune, Take and toss him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite! for I remember, I and you mounting upon teams after Ahab  his father, and the lord took upon him  this concern, saying,

26. If in deed [3the 4blood 5of Naboth 6and 7the 8blood  9of his sons 1I beheld 2yesterday], says the lord? And I shall recompense to you in  this portion of land, says the lord. And now lift him, and toss him in the portion of land, according to the word of the lord! 

27.  Jehu Strikes Ahaziah And Ahaziah king of Judah beheld, and he fled the way of Beth-agan. And [2pursued 3after 4him 1Jehu]. And he said, Even indeed him, strike him upon the chariot! And the did so in the ascent of Gur, which is the one of Ibleam. And he fled into Megiddo, and died there.

28. And [2set 3him  1his servants] upon the chariot, and led him into Jerusalem. And they entombed him with  his fathers in  his tomb in the city of David.

29. And in [2year 1the eleventh] of Jehoram king of Israel, Ahaziah took reign over Judah.

30. And Jehu came to Jezreel. And Jezebel heard, and she tinged [2with antimony  1her eyes], and she adorned  her head, and she looked through the window.

31. And Jehu entered into the city. And she said, Is it peace with Omri, the murderer  of his master?

32. And he lifted up  his face unto the window, and he beheld her. And he said, Who are you? Come down to me! And [3stooped forward to look down 4at 5him 1two 2eunuchs]. 

33.  Jehu Kills Jezebel And he said, Roll her over! And they rolled her over, and [2sprinkled  1her blood] against the wall, and against the horses; and they trampled upon her.

34. And Jehu entered, and ate and drank, and said, Watch indeed  this cursed one, and bury her, for [2the daughter 3of a king 1she is].

35. And they went to bury her, and they did not find of her but only the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

36. And they returned, and announced it to him. And he said, The word of the lord which he spoke by the hand  of his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of land in Jezreel [3shall eat 1the 2dogs] the flesh of Jezebel.

37. And [4will be 1the 2decaying flesh 3of Jezebel] as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so as to not say, This is Jezebel.  

## 2 Kings 10

1.  Jehu Kills All the House of Ahab And  to Ahab were seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote a scroll, and sent it unto Samaria, to the rulers of Samaria, and to the elders, and to the wet-nurses of the sons of Ahab, saying,

2. And now, whenever [3comes  2scroll 1this] to you, and with you are the sons  of your master, and with you the chariots and the horses, and [2cities 1fortified], and weapons,

3. that you shall look for the good, and the upright one among the sons  of your master. And you shall place him upon the throne  of his father, and you shall wage war for the house  of your master.

4. And they feared exceedingly, and said, Behold, the two kings did not stand against his face, and how shall we stand?

5. And they sent the ones over the household, and the ones over the city, and the elders, and the wet-nurses to Jehu, saying, [2your servants 1We are], and all as much as you should say to us we shall do. We will not give [2reign 1anyone]. The thing good in your eyes we will do.

6. And [2wrote 3to 4them 1Jehu 6scroll 5a second], saying, If you are with me, and  [3my voice 1you 2listen to], take the heads of the men of the sons  of your master, and bring them to me at  this hour tomorrow in Jezreel! And the sons of the king were seventy men, whom the stout men of the city nourished them.

7. And it came to pass as [3came 1the 2scroll] to them, that they took the sons of the king, and they slew them -- seventy men. And they put  their heads in baskets, and they sent to him in Jezreel.

8. And [3came 1the 2messenger] and reported to him, saying, They brought the heads of the sons of the king. And he said, Place them in two hills by the door of the gate until morning.

9. And it became morning, and he came forth and stood. And he said to all the people, You are just. Behold, I confederated against  my master, and I killed him; but who struck all of these?

10. See that there shall not fall of the saying of the lord unto the ground, of which the lord spoke against the house of Ahab. And the lord did as much as he spoke by the hand  of his servant Elijah.

11. And Jehu struck all the ones being left among the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all  his stout men, and  his well known men, and  his priests, unto  [2not 3leaving behind 1his] a vestige.

12. And he rose up and went into Samaria. He was in Beth-Akad of the shepherds in the way.

13. And Jehu found the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, Who are you? And they said, [2brothers 3of Ahaziah 1we are], and we came down in peace of the sons of the king, and the sons of the woman being in power. 

14.  Jehu Kills the Brothers of Ahaziah And he said, Seize them alive! And they seized them, and slew them in Beth-akad -- forty and two men. And he did not leave a man of them.

15. And he went from there, and he found  Jehonadab son of Rechab in the way for meeting him. And he blessed him, and [2said 3to 4him 1Jehu], Is [2straight  1your heart] with  my heart, as  my heart is with  your heart? And Jehonadab said, It is. And Jehu said, Then if it is, give  your hand! And he gave  his hand. And he hauled him to himself upon the chariot.

16. And he said to him, Come with me, and see in  my zealousness to the lord! And he sat by him in  his chariot.

17. And he entered into Samaria, and he struck all the ones left  of Ahab in Samaria, unto  obliterating him according to the saying of the lord, which he spoke to Elijah.

18. And Jehu gathered together all the people. And said to them, Ahab served  to Baal a little, Jehu shall serve to him much.

19. And now call to me all the prophets  of Baal, and  his priests, and all  his servants! Let not a man be overlooked! for [4sacrifice 3a great 1I 2make] to Baal. All who ever overlooked shall not live. And Jehu did it by trickery, that he might destroy the servants  of Baal.

20. And Jehu said, Sanctify a service  to Baal! And they proclaimed it.

38. And Jotham slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him with  his fathers in the city of David  his father. And [3reigned 1Ahaz 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Kings 16

1.  Ahaz Reigns in Judah In [2year 1the seventeenth] of Pekah son of Remaliah, [6reigned 1Ahaz 2son 3of Jotham 4king 5of Judah].

2. [2a son 3being twenty 4years old 1Ahaz was] in  his reigning. And sixteen years he reigned in Jerusalem, and he did not do the upright thing in the eyes of the lord his God as David  his father.

3. And he went in the way of the kings of Israel, and indeed  [2his son 1he led] through fire, according to the abominations of the nations, which the lord removed in front of the sons of Israel.

4. And he sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, and upon the hills, and underneath every tree of the woods. 

5.  Syria and Israel War Against Judah Then [4ascended 1Rezin 2king 3of Syria], and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, to Jerusalem for war. And they made assault against Ahaz, and they were not able to wage war.

6. In  that time [4returned 1Rezin 2king 3of Syria]  Elath  to Syria, and cast out the Jews from Elath. And the Edomites came into Elath, and they dwelt there until  this day.

7. And Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of the Assyrians, saying, [2your servant 3and 4your son 1I am]. Ascend and deliver me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel! the ones rising up against me.

8. And Ahaz took the silver and the gold  he found in the treasuries of the house of the lord and of the house of the king, and he sent [2to the 3king 4of the Assyrians 1gifts].

9. And [4heard 5him 1the 2king 3of the Assyrians]. And [3ascended up 1the king 2of the Assyrians] against Damascus, and he seized it, and he resettled it, and  he killed Rezin.

10. And [3went  1king 2Ahaz] to meet Tiglath-pileser king of the Assyrians in Damascus. And he saw the altar, the one in Damascus. And [3sent  1king 2Ahaz] to Urijah the priest the likeness of the altar, and the proportions of it, according to all its makings.

11. And [4built 1Urijah 2the 3priest] the altar according to all as much as [3sent  1king 2Ahaz] from Damascus. Thus [4did 1Urijah 2the 3priest] until the coming of the king from Damascus.

12. And [3came 1the 2king] from Damascus. And [3beheld 1the 2king] the altar. And [3drew near 4to 5the 6altar 1the 2king], and ascended unto it.

13. And he offered  his whole burnt-offering, and  his sacrifice offering; and  [2of his libation offering 1he offered a libation] to it; and he poured upon it the blood  [2peace offerings 1of his] -- upon the altar,

14. And the brass altar which was before the lord he brought forward in front of the house of the lord, from  between the altar and from  between the house of the lord. And he put it by the side of the altar according to the north.

15. And [3gave charge  1king 2Ahaz] to Uriah the priest, saying, Upon the [2altar  1great] offer the whole burnt-offering, the early morning sacrifice, and the [3sacrifice offering 1the 2evening], and the whole burnt-offerings of the king, and  his sacrifice offerings, and the whole burnt-offering of all the people, and  their sacrifice offerings, and  their libation offerings! And all the blood of the whole burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice offering [2upon 3it 1you shall pour out]! And the altar  of brass will be for me in the morning.

16. And [4did 1Urijah 2the 3priest] according to all as much as [4gave charge 5to him 1Ahaz 2the 3king].

17. And [3cut down  1king 2Ahaz] the joinery of the bases, and he moved [3from 4them 1the 2bathing tub]; and the sea he lowered from the oxen  of brass, of the ones underneath it, and he put it upon [2base 1a stone].

18. And the foundation of the chair of the Sabbaths he built in the house of the lord, and the entrance of the king the one outside, he turned in the house of the lord from in front of the king of the Assyrians.

19. And the rest of the words of Ahaz, as much as he did, behold are not these written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

20. And Ahaz slept with  his fathers, and he was entombed with  his fathers in the city of David. And [3reigned 1Hezekiah 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Kings 17

1.  Hoshea Reigns in Israel In [2year 1the twelfth]  of Ahaz king of Judah, [4reigned 1Hoshea 2son 3of Elah] in Samaria over Israel for nine years.

2. And he did the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him.

3. Against him there ascended Shalmaneser king of the Assyrians; and [2became 3to him 1Hoshea] as a servant, and he bore [2to him 1gifts].

4. And [4found 1the 2king 3of the Assyrians 6by 7Hoshea 5a plot], for Hoshea sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and did not bring gifts to the king of the Assyrians year by year. And [4assaulted 5him 1the 2king 3of the Assyrians], and tied him up in the house of the prison.

5. And the king of the Assyrians ascended unto all the land, and ascended unto Samaria, and assaulted it for three years.

6. In [2year 1the ninth] of Hoshea, [4seized 1the king 2of the 3Assyrians]  Samaria, and he resettled  Israel into Assyria, and he settled them in Halah and in Habor, the rivers of Gozan, in the mountains of the Medes. 

7.  The LORD Recounts Israel's Sin And it came to pass that [4sinned 1the 2sons 3of Israel] against the lord  their God, the one leading them from out of the land of Egypt, from beneath the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and they feared [2gods 1other].

8. And they went by the ordinances of the nations which the lord removed in front of the sons of Israel, and the kings of Israel as many as they did.

9. And [4clothed 1the 2sons 3of Israel] words of wrongdoings against the lord their God. And they built to themselves high places in all  their cities, from [2tower 1guard] unto [2city 1fortified].

10. And they set up to themselves stone monuments and sacred groves upon every [2hill 1high], and underneath every tree of the woods.

11. And they burned incense there in all the high places, as the nations which the lord moved far away from their face. And they made partners, and they graved images  to provoke [3to anger 1the 2 lord].

12. And they served to the idols which the lord said to them, Do not do  this thing!

13. And the lord testified to Israel, and to Judah, by the hand of all  his prophets, every one of them seers, saying, Turn from  [3ways 1your  2wicked], and guard  my commandments, and  my ordinances, and every  law! which I gave charge to your fathers, as many as I sent to them by the hand  of my servants the prophets.

14. And they did not hearken, and they hardened  their back above the back  of their fathers, the ones that trusted not in the lord  their God;

15. even thrusting away  his covenant, and the ordinances which he ordained with their fathers, and  his testimonies, as many as he testified to them; and they went after the vain things, and acted in folly, and followed after the nations  surrounding them, which the lord gave charge to them  to not do according to these things.

16. And they abandoned the commandments of the lord their God, and they made for themselves molten castings of two heifers, and they made a sacred grove, and did obeisance to all the military of the heaven, and they served to Baal.

17. And they led  their sons and  their daughters through fire. And they used oracles of divinations, and they foretold. And they were sold  to do the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord,  to provoke him to anger.

18. And the lord was enraged exceedingly with  Israel, and he removed them from  his face. He did not leave any behind except the tribe of Judah alone.

19. And indeed Judah did not guard the commandments of the lord  his God, and they went by the ordinances of Israel, which they did, and they thrusted away the lord.

20. And the lord was enraged with all the seed of Israel, and he shook them off, and gave them into the hand of the ones tearing them in pieces, until of which time he threw them away from his face.

21. Except that Israel was torn from the house of David; and they gave reign to  Jeroboam son of Nebat. And Jeroboam banished  Israel from following the lord, and he led them into sin -- [2sin 1a great].

22. And [4went 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did -- they did not abstain from them;

23. until of which time the lord removed  Israel from his face, as the lord spoke by the hand of all  his servants the prophets. And Israel was resettled from  its land into Assyria until  this day.

24. And [3led 1the king 2of the Assyrians] from out of Babylon the one from out of Cuthah, and from out of Ava, and from out of Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria instead of the sons of Israel. And they inherited  Samaria, and they settled in  its cities.

25. And it came to pass in the beginning  of their place of sitting down, they did not fear the lord. And the lord sent among them the lions, and they were being killed by them.

26. And they said to the king of the Assyrians, saying, The nations which you resettled and relocated, in the cities of Samaria, they know not the distinguishing manner  of the God of the land. And he sent to them lions, and behold, they are killing them, in so far as they do not know the distinguishing manner of the God of the land.

27. And [4gave charge 1the 2king 3of the Assyrians], saying, Lead away there one of the priests whom I resettled from Samaria! and let him go and let him dwell there! and he shall enlighten them on the distinguishing manner of the God of the land.

28. And they brought one of the priests which they resettled from Samaria, and he settled in Bethel. And he was enlightening them how they should fear the lord.

29. And [3were 4making 1nation 2by nation]  their gods. And they put them in the houses of the high places, which [3made 1the 2Samaritans], nation by nation in  their cities in which they dwelt.

30. And the men of Babylon made  Succoth Benoth. And the men of Cuth made  Nergal. And the men of Hamath made  Ashima.

31. And the Avites made  Nibhaz and  Tartak. And the Sepharvites incinerated  their sons by fire  to Adrammelech and Anammelech, gods of the Sepharvaim.

32. And they were fearing the lord, and they made for themselves priests of the high places; and they offered for themselves in the houses of the high places.

33. [2the 3 lord 1They were fearing], and  [2their gods 1they served], according to the distinguishing manner of the nations from where he resettled them from there.

34. Until  this day they do according to  their distinguishing manner. They are not fearing the lord, and  they do not do according to  their ordinances, and according to  their judgment, and according to the law, and according to the commandment which the lord gave charge to the sons of Jacob, of whom he established  his name Israel.

35. And the lord ordained with them a covenant, and he gave charge to them, saying, You shall not fear [2gods 1other], and you shall not do obeisance to them, and you shall not serve to them, and you shall not sacrifice to them.

36. For only to the lord, who led you from out of the land of Egypt with [2strength 1great] and with [2arm 1a high], him you shall fear, and to him you shall do obeisance, and to him you shall sacrifice.

37. And  his ordinances, and the judgments, and the commandments, and the law which he wrote for you, you shall guard to do all the days, and you shall not fear [2gods 1other].

38. And the covenant which he ordained with you you shall not forget; and you shall not fear [2gods 1other].

39. For only the lord  your God -- him you shall fear; and he will rescue you from the hand of all  your enemies.

40. And they hearkened not, but only in  [3ordinances 1their  2former] they acted.

41. And [3were  2nations 1these] fearing the lord, and [2to 3their carvings 1they served]; even indeed  their sons, and the sons  of their sons -- [3as 4did  5their fathers 1they 2do] unto  this day.  

## 2 Kings 18

1.  Hezekiah Reigns in Judah And it came to pass in [2year 1the third]  of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, [6reigned 1Hezekiah 2son 3of Ahaz 4king 5of Judah].

2. [2a son 3\Eit being 4and 5five 6years old 1He was] in  his taking reign, and twenty and nine years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Abi, daughter of Zachariah.

3. And he did  upright in the eyes of the lord, according to all as much as [3did 1David  2his father].

4. He removed the high places, and he broke the monuments, and [2the 3sacred groves 1he cut down], and he cut up the serpent  of brass which Moses made; for unto  those days [4were 1the 2sons 3of Israel] burning incense to it. And he called it Nehushtan.

5. In the lord God of Israel he hoped, there was not [3after 4him 1one likened 2to him] among the kings of Judah, and among the ones taking place before him.

6. And he cleaved to the lord. He did not leave from behind him, and he guarded  his commandments, as many as the lord gave charge to Moses.

7. And the lord was with him; in all the things which he did he perceived. And he annulled allegiance to the king of the Assyrians, and he did not serve to him.

8. He struck the Philistines unto Gaza, and unto its border, from the tower of the ones guarding, and unto [2city 1the fortified].

9. And it came to pass in the [2year  1fourth] to king Hezekiah, this is [3year 1the 2seventh]  of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, ascended Shalmaneser king of the Assyrians against Samaria, and assaulted it.

10. And he overtook it at the end of three years. In [2year 1the sixth]  of Hezekiah -- this is [2year 1the ninth]  of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was seized.

11. And [3resettled 1the king 2of the Assyrians] the Samarian into Assyria, and he put them in Halah, and in Habor by the river Gozan, and in the mountains of the Medes;

12. because they did not hearken to the voice of the lord  their God, and they violated  his covenant, all as much as he gave charge to Moses the manservant of the lord; and they did not hearken, and they did not do. 

13.  Sennacherib Wars with Judah And in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah [4ascended 1Sennacherib 2king 3of the Assyrians] against the [2cities 3of Judah  1fortified], and he seized them.

14. And [4sent 1Hezekiah 2king 3of Judah] messengers to the king of the Assyrians, to Lachish, saying, I have sinned, turn from me! What ever you should place upon me I will bear. And [4placed a tribute 1the 2king 3of the Assyrians] upon Hezekiah king of Judah of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

15. And Hezekiah gave all the silver  he found in the house of the lord, and in the treasuries of the house of the king.

16. In  that time [4cut off 1Hezekiah  2king 3of Judah] the doors of the temple of the lord, and the supports which [5gilded 1Hezekiah 2the 3king 4of Judah], and gave them to the king of the Assyrians.

17. And [3sent 1the king 2of the Assyrians]  Tartan, and  Rabsaris, and  Rabshakeh from Lachish to  king Hezekiah with [2force 1a heavy] to Jerusalem. And they ascended, and came to Jerusalem. And they stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is in the way of the field of the fuller.

18. And they yelled to Hezekiah. And [6came 7to 8them 1Eliakim 2son 3of Hilkiah 4the 5manager], and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the one taking record.

19. And [2said 3to 4them 1Rabshakeh], Say indeed to Hezekiah, Thus says the [2king  1great], the king of the Assyrians, What is  this reliance which you yield on?

20. How then do words of the lips and counsel [2the battle array 1become] for war? Now then, upon whom are you relying upon, that you annulled allegiance to me?

21. Behold, are you [2relying 1yourself] upon  [3rod  4of reed  2fractured 1this] -- upon Egypt? Thus if [2should stay 1man] upon it, it will enter into  his hand and puncture it. Thus is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all the ones relying upon him.

22. And if you should say to me, Upon the lord  our God we rely on. Is it not he that Hezekiah removed  his high places and  his altars, and he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before  this altar you shall do obeisance in Jerusalem?

23. And now mix in with my master the king of the Assyrians, and I will give to you two thousand horses -- if you shall be able to put for yourself a rider upon them.

24. And how will you turn back  the face [2toparch 1of one] of the [2servants  3of my master 1least of the], and hope for yourself upon Egypt for chariots and horsemen?

25. And now, is it without the lord that we ascended against  this place  to utterly destroy it? The lord said to me, Ascend against  this land and utterly destroy it!

26. And [8said 1Eliakim 2son 3of Hilkiah 4and 5Shebna 6and 7Joah] to Rabshakeh, Speak indeed to  your servants in Syrian! for we hear. And do not speak with us in Jewish to the ears of the people  upon the wall!

27. And [2said 3to 4them 1Rabshakeh], Is it to  your master, and to you [2sent 3me  1my master] to speak  these words? Is it not to the men, the ones sitting upon the wall,  to eat  their dung, and to drink  their urine with you together?

28. And Rabshakeh stood and yelled [2voice 1with a great] in Jewish, and spoke, and he said, Hear the words of the king, of the great king of the Assyrians!

29. Thus says the king, Let not [2lift 3you 1Hezekiah]! for in no way should he be able to rescue you from out of my hand.

30. And let not [2raise your hope 1Hezekiah] unto the lord! saying, In rescuing, [3will rescue 4us 1the 2 lord], and and in no way shall [2be delivered  1this city] into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.

31. Do not listen to Hezekiah! for thus says the king of the Assyrians, Do for me a blessing, and come forth to me! and [2shall eat 1each]  of his grapevine, and each  of his fig tree, and [2shall drink 1each]  water  of his well;

32. until whenever I should come, and I should take you into a land as  your land, a land of grain and wine and bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, and you shall live and you shall not die. And do not listen to Hezekiah! for he deceives you, saying, The lord shall deliver you.

33. Have by rescuing [5rescued 1the 2gods 3of the 4nations] each  his land from out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?

34. Where is the god of Hamath, and Arphad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim -- Hena and Ivah? Did they deliver  Samaria from out of my hand?

35. Who among all the gods of the lands is the one who rescued  his land from out of my hand, that the lord shall rescue  Jerusalem from out of my hand?

36. And they kept silent, and did not answer him a word, because of the commandment of the king, saying, You shall not answer him.

37. And [6entered 1Eliakim 2son 3of Hilkiah 4the 5manager], and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the one recording to Hezekiah tearing  their garments. And announced to him the words of Rabshakeh.  

## 2 Kings 19

1.  Hezekiah Distressed Over Syria's Threats And it came to pass as [3heard  1king 2Hezekiah], that he tore  his garments, and put on sackcloth, and entered into the house of the lord.

2. And he sent Eliakim the manager, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, having put on sackcloths, to Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet.

3. And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, A day of affliction, and of rebuke, and provocation to anger  is this day; for [3came 1the 2sons] unto birth pangs, and there is no strength to give birth.

4. If by any means [3shall hearken to 1the lord  2your God] all the words of Rabshakeh, whom [4sent 5him 1the king 2of the Assyrians  3his master] to berate the living God, and to reprove by words which [3heard 1the lord  2your God], that you shall take up a prayer for the remnant  being found.

5. And [5came 1the 2servants  3of king 4Hezekiah] to Isaiah.

6. And [2said 3to them 1Isaiah], Thus you shall say to  your master, Thus says the lord, You should not fear from the words which you heard, which [6blasphemed 7against 8me 1the 2servants 3of the 4 king 5of the Assyrians].

7. Behold, I give a spirit to him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return unto  his land, and I will cast him down by the broadsword in  his land.

8. And Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of the Assyrians waging war against Libnah; for he heard that he departed from Lachish.

9. And he heard concerning Tirhakah king of the Ethiopians, saying, Behold, he comes forth  to wage war against you. And he returned, and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus shall you say to Hezekiah king of Judah, Let not [3you 2deceive  1your God] in whom you rely upon him, saying, In no way should Jerusalem be delivered up into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.

11. Behold, you heard all as much as [3did 1the king 2of the Assyrians] in all the lands, as they utterly destroyed them; and how shall you be rescued?

12. Have [5rescued 1the 2gods 3of the 4nations] which [2utterly destroyed  1my fathers] --  both Gozan, and  Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, the ones in Thelasar?

13. Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim -- Hena and Ivah? 

14.  Hezekiah Reads the Scrolls And Hezekiah took the scrolls from out of the hand of the messengers and read them. And he ascended into the house of the lord, and [2unrolled 3them 1Hezekiah] before the lord.

15. And Hezekiah prayed to the lord, saying, O Lord  God of Israel, the one sitting upon the cherubim, you are  God alone among all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heaven and the earth.

16. Lean, O lord,  your ear, and hear! Open, O lord,  your eyes, and behold! And hear the words of Sennacherib! which he sent to berate the living God.

17. For truth, O lord, [3made desolate 1the kings 2of the Assyrians] the nations, and all  their land,

18. and put  their gods into the fire, for [2not 3gods 1they are], but only the works of the hands of men -- wood and stone. And they destroyed them.

19. And now, O lord  our God, deliver us from out of his hand! And they shall know in all the kingdoms of the earth that you are the lord  God alone.

20. And [4sent 1Isaiah 2son 3of Amoz] to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, I heard what you pray for to me concerning Sennacherib king of the Assyrians.

21. This is the word which the lord spoke against him, [4treats you with contempt 5and 6sneers at 7you 1The virgin 2daughter 3of Zion]. Over you [4her head 3shakes 1the daughter 2of Jerusalem].

22. Whom have you berated and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised up  your voice, and lifted [2into 3the height  1your eyes]? even against the holy one  of Israel.

23. By the hand of your messengers you have berated the lord, and said, By the multitude  of my chariots I ascended into the height of the mountains, the sides  of Lebanon, and I felled the greatness  of his cedar,  [2chosen 3cypresses 1his], and I came in the midst of the grove of Carmel.

24. I cooled myself and drank [2waters 1alien]; and I made quite desolate with the sole  of my feet all the rivers of the citadel.

25. Heard you not that far off I made her? From [2days 1ancient] I formed her, and now I brought her. And she became for haughtiness [4resettlements 3of combative 2cities 1of fortified].

26. And the ones dwelling in them weakened in the hand. They were alarmed and were disgraced. They became as grass of the field, and as the green pasturage; as tender shoots growing on roofs, and trampled before standing.

27. And  of your sitting-down, and  of your exiting, and  of your entering, and  of your rage against me I knew.

28. On account of  your being provoked to anger against me, that  your indulgence ascended to  my ears, and I shall put  my hook in  your nostrils, and bits in  your lips, and I will return you in the way which you came by it.

29. And this is to you the sign. You shall eat this  year the things grown by themselves, and in in the [2year  1second] the things rising up, and  [3year 1the 2third] you shall sow, and you shall reap, and you shall plant vineyards, and you shall eat  their fruit.

30. And he shall add to the one being preserved of the house of Judah, the one being left behind as a root below. And he shall produce fruit upward.

31. For from out of Jerusalem shall come forth a vestige, and the one rescuing from out of mount Zion. The zeal of the lord of the forces shall do this.

32. Therefore thus says the lord to the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into  this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow there, and he shall not anticipate it with a shield, nor shall he pour out dirt against it for a seige mound.

33. By the way in which he came by it, he shall return; and into  this city he shall not enter, says the lord.

34. And I shall shield over  this city  to deliver her because of myself, and because of David  my servant. 

35.  The Angel of The LORD Strikes the Assyrians And it came to pass at night, that there came forth an angel of the lord, and he struck among the camp of the Assyrians a hundred eighty-five thousand. And they rose early in the morning, and behold, all [2bodies 1dead].

36. And [4departed 7and 8returned 5and 6went 1Sennacherib 2king 3of the Assyrians], and he lived in Nineveh.

37. And it came to pass when he did obeisance in the house of Nisroch  his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer  his sons struck him with a sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And [3reigned 1Esar-haddon  2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Kings 20

1.  Hezekiah's Infirmity In  those days Hezekiah was infirm unto death. And [6entered 7to 8him 1Isaiah 2son 3of Amoz 4the 5prophet]. And he said to him, Thus says the lord, Give charge concerning  your house! for you die, and shall not live.

2. And Hezekiah turned  his face to the wall, and he prayed to the lord, saying,

3. O lord, remember indeed as much as I walked before you in truth, and in [2heart 1a perfect]! and  [2good 3in 4your eyes 1I did]. And Hezekiah wept in [2weeping 1a great].

4. And Isaiah was in the courtyard  between, and the saying of the lord came to him, saying,

5. Return! and you shall say to Hezekiah, the one leading  my people, Thus says the lord, the God of David  your father! I heard  your prayer, and I beheld  your tears. Behold, I shall heal you on the [2day  1third], and you shall ascend into the house of the lord.

6. And I will add to  your days fifteen years; and from the hand of the king of the Assyrians I will deliver you and  this city. And I shall shield over  this city because of myself, and because of David  my servant.

7. And Isaiah said, Let them take a dried cluster of figs, and place them upon the sore! and he shall be healed.

8. And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What is the sign that [2shall heal 3me 1the lord], and I shall ascend into the house of the lord on the [2day  1third]?

9. And Isaiah said, This to you is the sign by the lord, that the lord shall do the word which he spoke. Shall [3go 1the 2shadow] ten stairs or shall it return ten stairs. 

10.  God Returns the Shadow Ten Stairs And Hezekiah said, It is a light thing for the shadow to lean ten stairs, not thus, but let [3return 1the 2shadow] ten stairs to the rear.

11. And [4yelled out 1Isaiah 2the 3prophet] to the lord, and he returned the shadow on the stairs of Ahaz, in which it went down the ten stairs, to the rear.

12. In  that time [7sent 1Berodach 2Baladan 3the son 4of Baladan 5king 6of Babylon] letters and gifts to Hezekiah; for he heard that Hezekiah was infirm.

13. And [2rejoiced 3over 4them 1Hezekiah], and showed to them all the house of the spices -- the silver, and the gold, the aromatics, and the [2olive oil  1good], and the house of his weapons, and all as much as was found in  his treasuries. There was no place which [2did not 3show 4to them 1Hezekiah] in  his house, and in all  under his authority.

14. And [4entered 1Isaiah 2the 3prophet] to Hezekiah the king, and he said to him, What did [3say  2men 1these], and from what place came they to you? And Hezekiah said, From a land at a distance -- they came to me from Babylon.

15. And he said, What did they behold in  your house? And Hezekiah said, All as much is in  my house they beheld. There was nothing in  my house which I did not show to them, and in  my treasuries. 

16.  The Coming Babylonian Captivity And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the lord!

17. Behold, days come, says the lord, and there shall be taken away all the things in  your house, and as much as [2treasured up  1your fathers] until  this day into Babylon. There shall not be left behind a thing, said the lord.

18. And from  your sons of the ones coming forth from you, whom you procreated, they shall take them, and they will be eunuchs in the house of the king of Babylon.

19. And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, [4is good 1The 2word 3of the lord] which he spoke, let there be peace and justice in  my days!

20. And the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and all as much as he did, and all  his dominations, and the fountain and the aqueduct, and how he brought the water into the city; behold are not these written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

21. And Hezekiah slept with  his fathers, and he was entombed in the city of David. And [3reigned 1Manasseh 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Kings 21

1.  Manasseh's Wicked Reign in Judah [2a son 4years old 3being twelve 1Manasseh was] in  his taking reign, and fifty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Hephzi-bah.

2. And he did the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord; and he went according to the abominations of the nations, which the lord removed from in front of the sons of Israel.

3. And he returned and built the high places which [3tore down 1Hezekiah  2his father]. And he reestablished an altar  to Baal, and made the sacred groves as did Ahab king of Israel; and did obeisance to all the military of the heaven, and he served to them.

4. And he built an altar in the house of the lord, in which he said, In Jerusalem I will establish  my name.

5. And he built altars to all the military of the heaven in the two courtyards of the house of the lord.

6. And he led  his sons through the fire, and he prognosticated, and foretold. And he made ones who deliver oracles and diviners to multiply  to do the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord,  to provoke him to anger.

7. And he put the carving of the sacred grove in the house, in which the lord said to David, and to Solomon  his son, In  this house, and in Jerusalem, in which I chose from out of all the tribes  of Israel, that I will put  my name there into the eon.

8. And I will not proceed to shake the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers; only if they should guard  to do according to all which I gave charge to them, according to every  law which [3gave charge 4to them  2my servant 1Moses]. 

9.  The Prophets Speak of Coming Judgment And they did not hearken. And Manasseh misled them  to do the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord above the nations which the lord removed in front of the sons of Israel.

10. And the lord spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying,

11. On account of as much as [4did 1Manasseh  2king 3of Judah  7abominations 5these  6wicked] according to all as much as [3did 1the 2Amorite]  before him, and [4into sin 1even 2indeed  3Judah] by  his idols.

12. Is it not so? Thus says the lord  God of Israel, Behold, I bring evils upon Jerusalem and Judah, so that all hearing, it shall sound in both  of his ears.

13. And I stretch out over Jerusalem the measure of Samaria, and the weight of the house of Ahab. And I will wipe  Jerusalem as one wipes a writing tablet, and overturns it upon its face.

14. And I will wipe away the vestige  of my inheritance, and I will deliver them into the hands  of their enemies. And they will be for ravaging and for plunder by all  their enemies,

15. because of as much as they did the wicked thing in my eyes, and they were provoking me to anger from the day which I led  their fathers from out of Egypt, and until  this day.

16. And indeed [5blood 4innocent 1Manasseh poured out 3much 2exceedingly], until of which he filled  Jerusalem of it mouth to mouth; outside of  his sins, which he led Judah into sin,  to do the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord.

17. And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and all as much as he did, and  his sin which he sinned, behold are not these written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

18. And Manasseh slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him in the garden  of his house in the garden of Uzza. And [3reigned 1Amon  2his son] instead of him. 

19.  Amon Reigns in Judah [2a son 3being twenty 4and 5two 6years old 1Amon was] in  his taking reign. And two years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz from out of Jotbah.

20. And he did the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord, as [3did 1Manasseh  2his father].

21. And he went in every way in which [2went  1his father], and he slaved to the idols whom [2slaved to  1his father], and did obeisance to them.

22. And he abandoned the lord  God  of his fathers, and he did not go in the way of the lord.

23. And [4confederated 1the 2servants 3of Amon] against him, and they killed the king in  his house.

24. And [5struck 1the 2people 3of the 4land] the ones confederating against  king Amon. And [5gave reign to 1the 2people 3of the 4land]  Josiah his son instead of him.

25. And the rest of the words of Amon, as much as he did, behold are not these written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

26. And they entombed him in  his tomb in the garden of Uzza. And [3reigned 1Josiah  2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Kings 22

2. And he did  upright in the eyes of the lord, and he went in every way of David  his father. He did not separate to the right nor the left.

3. And it came to pass in the eighteenth year to king Josiah, [3sent 1the 2king]  Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe of the house of the lord, saying,

4. Ascend to Hilkiah the [2priest  1great], and set a seal upon the money! the money being carried into the house of the lord, which [5gathered together 1the 2ones guarding 3the 4money] from the people.

5. And let them put it into the hand of the ones doing the works, of the ones being ordained for the house of the lord! And he gave it to the ones doing the works in the house of the lord,  to strengthen the breach of the house,

6. to the fabricators, and to the builders, and to the stonemasons, and  to acquire wood and [2stones 1quarried],  to fortify the breach of the house.

7. Only they did not call them to account for the money  being given to them, for [3in 4trust 1they 2act]. 

8.  The Scroll of the Law Found And [5said 1Hilkiah 2the 4priest  3great] to Shaphan the scribe, [2a scroll 3of the 4law 1I found] in the house of the lord. And Hilkiah gave to Shaphan the scroll, and he read it.

9. And Shapan entered to king Josiah. And he turned to the king for a word, and said, [2cast  1Your servants] the silver being found in the house of the lord, and they put it in the hand of the ones doing the works  being ordained in the house of the lord.

10. And [4reported 1Shaphan 2the 3scribe] to the king, saying, [6a scroll 4gave 5to me 1Hilkiah 2the 3priest]. And [2read 3it 1Shaphan] before the king.

11. And it came to pass as [3heard 1the 2king] the words of the scroll of the law, that he tore  his garments.

12. And [3gave charge 1the 2king] to Hilkiah the priest, and to Ahikam son of Shaphan, and to Achbor son of Michaiah, and to Shaphan the scribe, and to Asahiah the servant of the king, saying,

13. Go, seek after the lord for me! and for all  my people, and for all Judah, concerning the words  of this scroll  being found; for great is the anger of the lord  burning away against us, because [2hearkened not  1our fathers] concerning the words  of this scroll,  to do according to all the things being written concerning us.

14. And [4went 1Hilkiah 2the 3priest], and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah to Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, the keeper of the cloaks. And she dwelt in Jerusalem in  Masena. And they spoke to her.

15. And she said to them, Thus says the lord the God of Israel, Speak to the man  sending you to me,

16. Thus says the lord, Behold, I bring bad things against  this place, and against the ones dwelling in it -- all the words of the scroll of which [3read  1the king 2of Judah],

17. because they abandoned me, and burned incense to other gods, that they should provoke me to anger in all the works  of their hands. And [2shall burn 1my rage] against  this place, and shall not be extinguished.

18. And to the king of Judah, the one sending you  to inquire of the lord, thus you shall say to him, Thus says the lord  God of Israel concerning the words which you heard;

19. for because [2was tender  1your heart], and you felt shame in front of me, as you hear as much as I spoke concerning  this place, and concerning the ones dwelling it,  to be for extinction and for a curse, and you tore  your garments, and you wept before me -- even indeed I heard, says the lord.

20. Is it not so, behold, I add you to  your fathers, and you shall be brought into  your tomb in peace. And [2shall not see  1your eyes] all the bad things which I bring against  this place. And they returned to the king the word.  

## 2 Kings 23

2. And [3ascended 1the 2king] to the house of the lord, and all the men of Judah, and all the ones dwelling Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people from small and unto great. And he read in  their ears all the words of the scroll of the covenant of the one being found in the house of the lord.

3. And [3stood 1the 2king] near the column, and he ordained the covenant before the lord  to go after the lord, and  to guard  his commandments, and  his testimonies, and  his orders, with a whole heart, and in the whole  in life,  to raise up the words  of this covenant  being written in  this scroll.

And he incinerated them outside Jerusalem in the plain of Kidron, and he took  their dust into Beth-el.

5. And he incinerated the idolatrous priests, of whom [4appointed 1the 2kings 3of Judah]  to burn incense in the high places, and in the cities of Judah, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and the ones burning incense  to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to the Mazuroth, and to all the military of the heaven.

6. And he brought forth the sacred grove carving from out of the house of the lord outside of Jerusalem unto the rushing stream Kidron. And he incinerated it at the rushing stream Kidron, and ground it fine as dust. And he tossed  its dust into the tombs of the sons of the people.

7. And he demolished the house of the male prostitutes of the ones in the house of the lord in which the women wove apparel there for the sacred grove.

8. And he brought in all the priests from the cities of Judah, and he defiled the high places where [3were burning incense 4there 1the 2priests], from Geba and unto Beer-sheba. And he demolished the high places  by the door of the gate of Joshua ruler of the city, of the ones at the left sides of a man at the gate of the city.

9. Only [5did not 6ascend 1the 2priests 3of the 4high places] to the altar of the lord in Jerusalem; in no way they ate unleavened breads in the midst  of their brethren.

10. And he defiled Topheth, the one in the ravine of the son of Hinnom,  [2to not lead 1for a man]  his son and  his daughter in fire  to Molech.

11. And he incinerated the horses which [3presented 1the kings 2of Judah] to the sun, in the entrance of the house of the lord, towards the treasury room of Nathan the eunuch of the king, of the one in the compound. And the chariot of the sun he incinerated by fire.

12. And the altars, the ones upon the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which [3made 1the kings 2of Judah], and the altars which Manasseh made in the two courtyards of the house of the lord, [3demolished 1the 2king], and tore down from there, and tossed  their dust into the rushing stream Kidron.

13. And the house  upon the face of Jerusalem, the one at the right of the mount  of Mosoath, which [4built 1Solomon 2king 3of Israel] to Ashtoreth the loathsome thing of the Sidonians, and to Chemosh the loathsome thing of Moab, and to Molech the abomination of the sons of Ammon, [3defiled 1the 2king].

14. And he broke the monuments, and cut down the sacred groves, and filled  their places of bones of men.

15. And indeed the [2altar  3in 4Beth-el  1high], which [4made 1Jeroboam 2son 3of Nebat], who led Israel into sin, also indeed  [4altar 2that  3high 1he tore down], and he broke  its stones, and made them fine into dust, and he incinerated the sacred grove. 

16.  Fulfillment of the Prophecy of the Man of God And Josiah turned and saw the tombs of the ones being there in the mount, and he sent and took the bones from out of the tombs, and he incinerated them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the saying of the lord which [4spoke 1the 2man  3of God] when  Jeroboam stood near the altar in the holiday. And turning Josiah lifted  his eyes upon the burying-place of the man  of God, the one speaking  these words;

17. and he said, What is  that high rock which I see? And [5said 6to him 1the 2men 3of the 4city], The grave of the man  of God, of the one coming from out of  Judah, and calling  these words which you did against the altar  in Beth-el.

18. And he said, Allow him! no one move  his bones! And he preserved  his bones with the bones of the prophet  having come from out of Samaria.

19. And indeed all the houses of the high places, of the ones in the cities of Samaria which [3made 1the kings 2of Israel]  to provoke the lord to anger, Josiah removed, and he did to them according to all the works which he did in Beth-el.

20. And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places  being there upon the altars. And he incinerated the bones of the men upon them. And returned to Jerusalem.

21. And [3gave charge 1the 2king] to all the people, saying, Observe the passover to the lord  your God! as it is written in the scroll  of this covenant.

22. For did not take place according to  this passover from the days of the judges that judged  Israel, and in all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Judah,

23. for only in the eighteenth year  of king Josiah [4took place  1this passover 2to the 3 lord] in Jerusalem.

24. And indeed the soothsayers, and the diviners, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the loathsome things  taking place in the land of Judah and in  Jerusalem, [3removed  1king 2Josiah], that [5should be established 1the 2words 3of the 4law], the ones being written upon the scroll which [4found 1Hilkiah 2the 3priest] in the house of the lord.

25. [5likened 6to him 1There was no 2king 3before 4him], who turned towards the lord with [2entire 3heart 1his], and with [2entire 3life 1his], and with [2entire  3strength 1his], according to all the law of Moses. And after him rose up not one like him.

26. Only [2did not 3turn 1the lord] from [3rage  4of his anger 1the 2great] of which [3was enraged 2anger 1his] against  Judah, against all the provocations to anger which [2provoked him to anger 1Manasseh].

27. And the lord said, And indeed  Judah I shall remove from my face, as I removed  Israel, and I will thrust away  this city which I chose --  Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, [2will be  1My name] there.

28. And the rest of the words of Josiah, and all as much as he did, are these not written upon the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? 

29.  Josiah Dies in Battle In  his days ascended Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt against the king of the Assyrians at the river Euphrates. And [4went 1Josiah 2the 3king] for a meeting against him. And [2killed 3him 1Necho] in Megiddo, in  his seeing him.

30. And [2conducted 3him  1his servants] dead in Megiddo. And they led him into Jerusalem, and they entombed him in  his tomb in the city of David. And [5took 1the 2people 3of the 4land]  Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and anointed him and gave him reign instead of  his father.

33.  Pharaoh Necho Sets Jehoiakim Over Jerusalem And [3moved 4him 1Pharaoh 2Necho] to Riblah in the land of Hamath, so as to not reign in Jerusalem. And he put a penalty against the land -- a hundred talents of silver, and ten talents of gold.

34. And [3put to reign 1Pharaoh 2Necho] over them  Eliakim son of Josiah instead of Josiah  his father, and he turned  his name into Jehoiakim. And  [2Jehoahaz 1he took], and he led him away into Egypt, and he died there.

35. And the silver and the gold Jehoiakim gave  to Pharaoh, but he assessed the land  to give the money by the mouth of Pharaoh; from each man according to  his assessed value; they gave the silver and the gold with the people of the land  to give to Pharaoh Necho.

24. And Gedaliah swore by an oath to them, and to their men, and said to them, Do not fear the passing by of the Chaldeans! Settle in the land, and serve the king of Babylon! and it will be well to you.

30. And  his feasting was a feasting always given to him from out of the house of the king -- [2reckoning 1a day's] in  his day, all the days  of his life.
