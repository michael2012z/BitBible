## 3 John 1

1.  Walk in Truth The elder, to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.

2. Beloved, concerning all things I make a vow for you to prosper and to be in health, as [3prospers 1your  2soul].

3. For I rejoiced exceedingly [2coming 1of the brethren], and bearing witness of you in the truth, as you [2in 3truth 1walk].

4. [3greater 5than this 2no 1I have 4joy], that I should hear of  my children [2in 3truth 1walking].

5. Beloved, [2trusting 1do] what ever you should work among the brethren, and among the strangers,

6. (the ones witnessing [3of yours 1to the 2love] before the assembly), whom [2well 1you shall do] having sent forward worthily  of God.

7. For on account of  his name they went forth [2nothing 1taking] from the nations.

8. We then ought to accept  such, that [2fellow-workers 1we should become] in the truth.

9. I wrote to the assembly, but the one enjoying being first of them -- Diotrephes, does not welcome us.

10. On account of this, if I come, I will remind him the works which he does -- [2words 1evil] prating against us. And not being sufficient with these, neither he himself welcomes the brethren, and the ones wanting to he restrains, and [2of 3the 4assembly 1casts them out].

11. Beloved, do not imitate  evil, but the good! The one doing good [2of  3God 1is]; but the one doing evil has not seen  God.

12. To Demetrius witness is borne by all, and by [3itself 1the 2truth]; and we also bear witness, and you know that  our witness is true.

13. Many things I have to write, but I do not want by ink and reed to write to you.

14. But I hope immediately to see you, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to you. [3greet 4you 1The 2friends]. Greet the friends by name!
