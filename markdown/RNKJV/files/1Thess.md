# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the assembly of the Thessalonians which is in יהוה the Father and in the Master Yahushua the Messiah: favour be unto you, and peace, from יהוה our Father, and the Master Yahushua the Messiah.

2. We give thanks to יהוה always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;

3. Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Master Yahushua the Messiah, in the sight of יהוה and our Father;

4. Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of Elohim.

5. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

6. And ye became followers of us, and of the Master, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit:

7. So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

8. For from you sounded out the word of the Master not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward יהוה is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.

9. For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to יהוה from idols to serve the living and true Elohim;

10. And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Yahushua, which delivered us from the wrath to come.  

## 1 Thessalonians 2

1. For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:

2. But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our Elohim to speak unto you the gospel of יהוה with much contention.

3. For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:

4. But as we were allowed of יהוה to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but יהוה, which trieth our hearts.

5. For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; יהוה is witness:

6. Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of the Messiah.

7. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:

8. So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of יהוה only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.

9. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of Elohim.

10. Ye are witnesses, and יהוה also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

11. As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,

12. That ye would walk worthy of יהוה, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

13. For this cause also thank we יהוה without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of יהוה which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of יהוה, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

14. For ye, brethren, became followers of the assemblies of יהוה which in Judaea are in the Messiah Yahushua: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:

15. Who both killed the Master Yahushua, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not יהוה, and are contrary to all men:

16. Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.

17. But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.

18. Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.

19. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Master Yahushua the Messiah at his coming?

20. For ye are our glory and joy.  

## 1 Thessalonians 3

1. Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;

2. And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of יהוה, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of the Messiah, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:

3. That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

4. For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

5. For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.

6. But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:

7. Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:

8. For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Master.

9. For what thanks can we render to יהוה again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our Elohim;

10. Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

11. Now יהוה himself and our Father, and our Master Yahushua the Messiah, direct our way unto you.

12. And יהוה make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:

13. To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before יהוה, even our Father, at the coming of our Master Yahushua the Messiah with all his saints.  

## 1 Thessalonians 4

1. Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Master Yahushua, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please יהוה, so ye would abound more and more.

2. For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Master Yahushua.

3. For this is the will of יהוה, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:

4. That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;

5. Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not יהוה:

6. That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that יהוה is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

7. For יהוה hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

8. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but יהוה, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

9. But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of יהוה to love one another.

10. And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;

11. And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

12. That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.

13. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

14. For if we believe that Yahushua died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Yahushua will Elohim bring with him.

15. For this we say unto you by the word of יהוה, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Master shall not prevent them which are asleep.

16. For Yahushua himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of יהוה: and the dead in the Messiah shall rise first:

17. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Master in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Master.

18. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  

## 1 Thessalonians 5

1. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.

2. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of יהוה so cometh as a thief in the night.

3. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.

4. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.

5. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

6. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

7. For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.

8. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

9. For יהוה hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Master Yahushua the Messiah,

10. Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

11. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.

12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in יהוה, and admonish you;

13. And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.

14. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.

15. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.

16. Rejoice evermore.

17. Pray without ceasing.

18. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of יהוה in the Messiah Yahushua concerning you.

19. Quench not the Spirit.

20. Despise not prophesyings.

21. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

22. Abstain from all appearance of evil.

23. And the very Elohim of peace separate you wholly; so that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Master Yahushua the Messiah.

24. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

25. Brethren, pray for us.

26. Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

27. I charge you by the Master that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

28. The favour of our Master Yahushua the Messiah be with you.
