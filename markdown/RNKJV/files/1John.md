# 1 John

## 1 John 1

1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life--

2. the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us--

3. that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Yahushua the Messiah.

4. And these things we write to you that your joy may be full.

5. This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that יהוה is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

6. If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.

7. But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Yahushua the Messiah His Son cleanses us from all sin.

8. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

9. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.  

## 1 John 2

1. My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Yahushua the Messiah the righteous.

2. And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.

3. Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.

4. He who says, "I know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

5. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of YHWH is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.

6. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.

7. Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.

8. Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.

9. He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now.

10. He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.

11. But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

12. I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake.

13. I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.

14. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of YHWH abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.

15. Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

16. For all that is in the world--the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life--is not of the Father but is of the world.

17. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of YHWH abides forever.

18. Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the AntiMessiah is coming, even now many antiMessiahs have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.

19. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us.

20. But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.

21. I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

22. Who is a liar but he who denies that Yahushua is the Messiah? He is antiMessiah who denies the Father and the Son.

23. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.

24. Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.

25. And this is the promise that He has promised us--eternal life.

26. These things I have written to you concerning those who try to deceive you.

27. But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him.

28. And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.

29. If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of Him.  

## 1 John 3

1. Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of YHWH! Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.

2. Beloved, now we are children of YHWH; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.

3. And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.

4. Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law, for sin is the transgression of the law.

5. And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.

6. Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.

7. Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.

8. He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of YHWH was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.

9. Whoever has been born of YHWH does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of YHWH.

10. In this the children of YHWH and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of YHWH, nor is he who does not love his brother.

11. For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,

12. not as Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother's righteous.

13. Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you.

14. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death.

15. Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

16. By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

17. But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of YHWH abide in him?

18. My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.

19. And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.

20. For if our heart condemns us, YHWH is greater than our heart, and knows all things.

21. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward YHWH.

22. And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

23. And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Yahushua the Messiah and love one another, as He gave us commandment.

24. Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.  

## 1 John 4

1. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of YHWH; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

2. By this you know the Spirit of YHWH: Every spirit that confesses that Yahushua the Messiah has come in the flesh is of YHWH,

3. and every spirit that does not confess that Yahushua the Messiah has come in the flesh is not of YHWH. And this is the spirit of the antimessiah, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.

4. You are of YHWH, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.

5. They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them.

6. We are of YHWH. He who knows YHWH hears us; he who is not of YHWH does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

7. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of YHWH; and everyone who loves is born of YHWH and knows YHWH.

8. He who does not love does not know YHWH, for YHWH is love.

9. In this the love of YHWH was manifested toward us, that YHWH has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.

10. In this is love, not that we loved YHWH, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

11. Beloved, if YHWH so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

12. No one has seen YHWH at any time. If we love one another, YHWH abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us.

13. By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.

14. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.

15. Whoever confesses that Yahushua is the Son of YHWH, YHWH abides in him, and he in YHWH.

16. And we have known and believed the love that YHWH has for us. YHWH is love, and he who abides in love abides in YHWH, and YHWH in him.

17. Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.

18. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.

19. We love Him because He first loved us.

20. If someone says, "I love YHWH," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love YHWH whom he has not seen?

21. And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves YHWH must love his brother also.  

## 1 John 5

1. Whosoever believeth that Yahushua is the Messiah is born of יהוה: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.

2. By this we know that we love the children of יהוה, when we love יהוה, and keep his commandments.

3. For this is the love of יהוה, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.

4. For whatsoever is born of יהוה overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

5. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Yahushua is the Son of יהוה?

6. This is he that came by water and blood, even Yahushua the Messiah; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

7. For there are three that bear witness:

8. the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

9. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of יהוה is greater: for this is the witness of יהוה which he hath testified of his Son.

10. He that believeth on the Son of יהוה hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not יהוה hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that יהוה gave of his Son.

11. And this is the record, that יהוה hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

12. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of יהוה hath not life.

13. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of יהוה; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of יהוה.

14. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

15. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

16. If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.

17. All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

18. We know that whosoever is born of יהוה sinneth not; but he that is begotten of יהוה keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

19. And we know that we are of יהוה, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.

20. And we know that the Son of יהוה is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Yahushua the Messiah. This is the true Elohim, and eternal life.

21. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. amein.
