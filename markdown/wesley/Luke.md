# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Forasmuch as many have undertaken to compose a narrative of the facts which have been fully confirmed among us,

2. Even as they who were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word from the beginning, delivered them to us:

3. It seemed good to me also, having accurately traced all things from their first rise, to write unto thee in order, most noble Theophilus,

4. That thou mayst know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.

5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

7. And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.

8. And while he executed the priest's office before God,

9. in the order of his course, According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn the incense, going into the temple of the Lord.

10. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.

11. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

12. And Zacharias seeing him was troubled, and fear fell upon him.

13. But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.

14. And thou shalt have joy and exultation, and many shall rejoice at his birth.

15. For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

16. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.

17. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

18. And Zacharias said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife advanced in years.

19. And the angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.

20. And behold, thou shalt be deaf, and not able to speak, till the day that these things are done, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.

21. And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.

22. And coming out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived, that he had seen a vision; for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.

23. And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he went to his own house.

24. And after these days, his wife Elisabeth conceived,

25. and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord done to me, in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.

26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, to a city of Galilee,

27. named Nazareth, To a virgin of the house of David, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, and the virgin's name was Mary.

28. And the angel coming in to her, said, Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.

29. But she seeing him, was troubled at his saying, and reasoned, what manner of salutation this should be.

30. And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.

31. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.

32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David.

33. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob; for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

34. Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?

35. And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born, shall be called the Son of God.

36. And behold thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

37. For with God, nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word.

38. And the angel departed from her.

39. And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the hill-country, into a city of Judah ,

40. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

41. And when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost,

42. And cried with a loud voice and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

43. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. For lo! when the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

45. And happy is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

46. And Mary said,

47. My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

48. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

49. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.

50. And his mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to generation.

51. He hath wrought strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

52. He hath put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted them of low degree.

53. He hath filled the hungry with good things, but sent the rich empty away.

54. He hath helped his servant Israel,

55. in remembrance of his mercy, As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.

56. And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.

57. Now Elisabeth's full time came, that she should be delivered, and she brought forth a son.

58. And her neighbours and relations heard, that the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her.

59. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.

60. But his mother answering said, Nay, but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.

62. And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.

63. And asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.

64. And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, praising God.

65. And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were noised abroad, in all the hill-country of Judea.

66. And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;

68. for he hath visited and redeemed his people,

69. And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant David:

70. As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began: That we should be saved from our enemies,

71. and from the hand of all that hate us;

72. To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,

73. The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

74. That he would grant us, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,

75. to serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.

76. And thou, child, shalt be a prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways,

77. To give knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins,

78. Thro' the tender mercy of our God, whereby the Day-spring from on high hath visited us,

79. To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.

80. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his being shewn to Israel.

## Luke 2

1. And in those days there went out a decree from Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be inrolled.

2. (Now this first inrolment was made, when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

3. And all went to be inrolled, every one to his own city.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,

5. (because he was of the family and houshold of David) To be inrolled with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child.

6. And while they were there, the days were fulfilled, that she should be delivered.

7. And she brought forth her son, the first-born, and swathed him, and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

8. And there were in the same country shepherds, lying out in the field, and keeping watch over their flock by night.

9. And lo an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.

10. And the angel said to them, Fear not; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

11. For to you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.

12. And this shall be a sign to you; ye shall find the babe, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest;

14. and on earth peace; goodwill toward men.

15. And when the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is done, which the Lord hath made known to us.

16. And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in the manger.

17. And having seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.

18. And all that heard wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary kept all these things, comparing them together in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.

21. And when eight days were fulfilled, to circumcise the child, his name was called Jesus, which was named of the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.

22. And when the days of purification were fulfilled according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:

23. (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that

24. openeth the womb shall be holy to the Lord) And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.

25. And behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and religious, waiting for the Consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

26. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

27. And he came by the spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the Law,

28. He took him up in his arms, and blessed God and said, Lord,

29. now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:

30. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation: Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.

31. A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

32. And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.

33. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother,

34. Behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against,

35. (Yea, and a sword shall pierce thro' thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

36. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity.

37. And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers, night and day.

38. And she coming in at that hour, gave thanks to the Lord, and spake of him to all that were waiting for redemption in Jerusalem.

39. And when they had performed all things, according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.

41. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year, at the feast of the passover.

42. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, after the custom of the feast.

43. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew it not,

44. But supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey; and sought him among their kinsfolk and among their acquaintance.

45. And not finding him, they went back to Jerusalem, seeking him.

46. And after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.

47. And all that heard him were astonished, at his understanding and answers.

48. And seeing him they were amazed. And his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou done thus to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

49. And he said to them, Why sought ye me? Knew ye not, that I must be about my Father's business?

50. And they understood not the saying which he spake to them.

51. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them; but his mother kept all these things in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,

2. Annas being the high priest and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.

3. And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins:

4. As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

5. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth: And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

6. Then said he to the multitudes,

7. that came forth to be baptized of him, Ye brood of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and say not within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father; for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

9. And now also the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

10. And the multitude asked him, saying, What then shall we do? He answering saith to them,

11. He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.

12. And publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him, Master, what shall we do?

13. And he said to them, Exact no more than what is appointed you.

14. And the soldiers likewise asked him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your pay.

15. And as the people were in expectation, and all mused in their hearts of John,

16. whether he were not the Christ, John answered saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:

17. Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

18. And many other things in his exhortation preached he to the people.

19. But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and concerning all the evils which Herod had done, Added also this above all,

20. that he shut up John in prison.

21. Now while all the people were baptizing, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized,

22. and praying, the heaven was opened, And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily form, like a dove, upon him, and a voice came from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I delight.

23. And Jesus was about thirty years of age, when he began his ministry, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli,

24. The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna,

25. the son of Joseph, The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum,

26. the son of Esli, the son of Nagge, The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Shimei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah, The son of Johanan,

27. the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel,

28. the son of Neri, The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam,

29. the son of Elmodam, the son of Er, The son of Jose, the son of Eleazar,

30. the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, The son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Johanan, the son of Eliakim,

31. The son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan,

32. the son of David, The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Booz,

33. the son of Salmon, the son of Naasson, The son of Aminadab, the son of Aaron, the son of Esrom, the son of Phares, the son of Judah,

34. The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah,

35. the son of Nahor, The son of Saruch, the son of Ragau, the son of Phalec,

36. the son of Heber, the son of Sala, The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, The son of Methuselah,

37. the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Maleleel,

38. the son of Cainan, The son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

## Luke 4

1. And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

2. Being forty days tempted by the devil. And in those days he ate nothing, and when they were ended he hungered.

3. And the devil said to him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.

4. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

5. And the devil taking him up into an high mountain, shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment.

6. And the devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them; for it is delivered to me, and I give it to whomsoever I will.

7. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

8. And Jesus answering said to him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

9. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the battlement of the temple, and said, If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down from hence:

10. For it is written, He shall charge his angels concerning thee, to keep thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up,

11. lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

12. And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

13. And the devil, having ended all the temptation, departed from him till a convenient season.

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of him, thro' all the region round about.

15. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

16. And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up; and as his custom was; he went into the synagogue on the sabbath, and stood up to read.

17. And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah, and having opened the book,

18. he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

19. To publish the acceptable year of the Lord.

20. And having closed the book, he gave it again to the servant, and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.

21. And he said to them, This day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears.

22. And they all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?

23. And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself. Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy own country.

24. And he said, Verily I say to you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.

25. I tell you of a truth, Many widows were in Israel, in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, while a great famine was thro' all the land.

26. Yet to none of these was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a widow.

27. And many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet none of them was healed, but Naaman the Syrian.

28. And all in the synagogue hearing these things, were filled with fury,

29. And rising up, thrust him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, to cast him down headlong.

30. But he passing thro' the midst of them, went away.

31. And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.

32. And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.

33. And there was in the synagogue, a man who had a spirit of an unclean devil; and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, Let us alone:

34. What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy one of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And the devil having thrown him in the midst, came out of him, and hurt him not.

36. And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What word is this, that with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out!

37. And the same of him went forth into every place of the country round about.

38. And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was ill of a fever, and they besought him for her.

39. And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her: and immediately she arose and served them.

40. Now when the sun was set, all that had any sick of divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.

41. And devils also came out of many, crying out and saying, Thou art Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuking them, suffered them not to say, that they knew he was the Christ.

42. And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the multitude sought him, and came to him, and detained him, that he might not depart from them.

43. And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore am I sent.

44. And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. And as the multitude pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesareth,

2. And saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

3. And going into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he desired him to thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the multitude out of the boat.

4. When he had ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

5. But Simon answering said to him, Master, Having toiled all the night, we have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word, I will let down the net.

6. And having done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net brake.

7. And they beckoned to their partners, who were in the other boat, to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.

8. Simon Peter seeing it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

9. For astonishment seized him, and all that were with him, at the draught of fishes,

10. which they had taken, And in like manner also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

11. And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed him.

12. And when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy, who seeing Jesus, fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

13. And putting forth his hand he touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And he charged him to tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

15. But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came together, to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.

16. But he withdrew into the deserts and prayed.

17. And on a certain day as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and out of Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

18. And behold men bringing on a couch a man that was ill of the palsy; and they sought to bring him in, and lay him before him.

19. And not finding by what way they might bring him in thro' the multitude, they went upon the house, and let him down thro' the tiling with his couch into the midst, before Jesus.

20. And seeing their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

21. And the scribes and the Pharisees reasoned, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies?

22. Who can forgive sins but God only? And Jesus knowing their thoughts, answered and said to them, Why reason ye in your hearts?

23. Which is easier? To say, Thy sins are forgiven thee? Or to say, Rise up and walk?

24. But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralytic) I say to thee, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thine house.

25. And immediately rising up before them, and taking up that on which he lay, he went to his house, glorifying God.

26. And they were all amazed and glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.

27. And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, Follow me.

28. And leaving all, he rose up and followed him.

29. And Levi made him a great entertainment, in his own house; and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.

30. But the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

31. And Jesus answering said to them, They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

32. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

33. And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John, and likewise of the Pharisees, fast often and make prayers; but thine eat and drink?

34. And he said to them, Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bride-groom is with them?

35. But the days will come, when the bride-groom shall be taken away from them: and then shall they fast in those days.

36. He spake also a parable to them, No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; otherwise both the new maketh a rent, and the piece out of the new agreeth not with the old.

37. And no man putteth new wine into old leathern-bottles: else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles will perish.

38. But new wine must be put into new bottles, and both are preserved.

39. And no man having drunk old wine, straightway desireth new; for he saith, The old is better.

## Luke 6

1. And on the first sabbath after the second day of unleavened bread, he went thro' the corn-fields, and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.

2. And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?

3. And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read, even this, what David did, when he hungered, and they that were with him?

4. How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the shew-bread, and gave also to them that were with him, which it is not lawful to eat, but for the priests only?

5. And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

6. And on another sabbath also he went into the synagogue and taught.

7. And there was a man whose right-hand was withered. And the scribes and Pharisees watched, whether he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.

8. But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, Rise up and stand forth in the midst.

9. And he arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you, Which is lawful on the sabbath, To do good, or to do evil?

10. To save life, or to kill? And looking round upon them all, he said to him, Stretch forth thy hand; and he did so: and his hand was restored as the other.

11. And they were filled with madness, and talked one with another, what they should do to Jesus.

12. And in those days he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in the prayer of God.

13. And when it was day, he called to him his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom also he named Apostles:

14. Simon (whom also he named Peter) and Andrew his brother:

15. James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas,

16. James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, Jude the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.

17. And coming down with them, he stood on a plain, and the croud of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases:

18. And they that were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed.

19. And the whole multitude sought to touch him; for virtue went out of him, and healed them all.

20. And lifting up his eyes on his disciples, he said, Happy are ye poor: for your's is the kingdom of God.

21. Happy are ye that hunger now; for ye shall be satisfied: happy are ye that weep now; for ye shall laugh.

22. Happy are ye when men shall hate you, and shall separate you from their company, and shall revile you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

23. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy; for behold your reward is great in heaven; for in like manner did their fathers to the prophets.

24. But wo to you that are rich; for ye have your consolation.

25. Wo to you that are full; for ye shall hunger: wo to you that laugh now; for ye shall mourn and weep.

26. Wo to you, when all men shall speak well of you; for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

27. But I say to you that hear, Love your enemies; do good to them that hate you,

28. Bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.

29. And to him that smiteth thee on the cheek, offer also the other: and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coat also.

30. Give to every man that asketh thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.

31. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.

32. For if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? For sinners also love those that love them.

33. And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? For even sinners do the same.

34. And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? For even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

35. But love ye your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful and the evil.

36. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

37. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemed; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

38. Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete with, it shall be measured to you again.

39. And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch?

40. The disciple is not above his master, but every one that is perfected, shall be as his master.

41. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye?

42. Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, thou thyself not seeing the beam that is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

43. For there is no good tree which bringeth forth corrupt fruit, neither a corrupt tree, which bringeth forth good fruit.

44. For every tree is known by its own fruit; for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor from a bramble do they gather grapes.

45. A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

46. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?

47. Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like.

48. He is like a man, who built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream broke vehemently upon that house, but could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.

49. But he that heareth, and doth not, is like a man that built an house without a foundation upon the earth: against which the stream broke vehemently, and immediately it fell: and the breach of that house was great.

## Luke 7

1. Now when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

2. And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.

3. And hearing of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, beseeching him to come and heal his servant.

4. And coming to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom thou shouldest do this.

5. For he loveth our nation, and hath himself built us a synagogue.

6. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof.

7. Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

8. For I am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.

9. Jesus hearing these things, marvelled at him, and turning, said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

10. And they that had been sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.

11. And he went afterward to a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him and a great multitude.

12. And as he drew nigh the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude of the city was with her.

13. And the Lord seeing her, was moved with tender compassion for her, and said, Weep not.

14. And he came and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.

15. And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother.

16. And fear seized all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people.

17. And this rumour of him went forth through all Judea, and all the country round about.

18. And the disciples of John informed him of all these things. And John,

19. calling to him two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?

20. And the men being come to him, said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?

21. And in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight.

22. And he answering said to them, Go and tell John the things ye have seen and heard: the blind see; the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; to the poor the gospel is preached.

23. And happy is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me.

24. And when the messengers of John were departed, he said to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?

25. A reed shaken by the wind? But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that are splendidly apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings palaces.

26. But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

28. For I say to you, among those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.

29. And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

30. But the Pharisees and scribes made void the counsel of God, toward themselves, being not baptized of him.

31. To whom then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.

33. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.

34. The Son of man is come, eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.

35. But wisdom is justified by all her children.

36. And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, he sat down to table.

37. And behold a woman in the city, who had been a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee's house,

38. brought an alabaster box of ointment, And standing at his feet behind him weeping, watered his feet with a shower of tears, and wiped them, with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

39. But the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known, who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.

40. And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

41. A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

42. But they having nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both: Which therefore will love him most?

43. Simon answering said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most. He said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.

44. And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath watered my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.

45. Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

46. Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.

47. Wherefore I say to thee, Those many sins of her's are forgiven; therefore she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little.

48. And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at table with him said within themselves,

49. Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

50. And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace.

## Luke 8

1. And afterward he went through every city and village preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him.

2. And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven devils,

3. And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance.

4. And much people being gathered together, coming to him out of every city, he spake by a parable, A sower went forth to sow his seed:

5. and while he sowed, some fell by the way-side; and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.

6. And some fell upon a rock, and springing up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.

7. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.

8. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundred fold. And saying these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

9. And his disciples asked him, What is this parable?

10. And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others in parables, so that seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not understand.

11. Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.

12. Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

13. Those on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But they have no root, who for a while believe; but in time of temptation fall away.

14. That which fell among thorns are they, who, having heard, go forth, and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

15. But that on the good ground are they, who, having heard the word, keep it in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with perseverance.

16. No man having lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.

17. For there is nothing hid that shall not be discovered, neither any thing concealed, that shall not be known and come to light.

18. Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even what he hath.

19. Then came toward him his mother and his brethren, but could not come to him for the croud.

20. And it was told him by some who said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

21. And he answering said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and keep it.

22. And on a certain day he went into a vessel with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put to sea.

23. And as they sailed, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in danger.

24. And they came and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish! And he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And he said to them, Where is your faith? But they were afraid and wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this? For he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him.

26. And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over-against Galilee.

27. And as he went forth to land, there met him out of the city, a certain man that had had devils a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in an house, but in the tombs.

28. But seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What hast thou to do with me, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, torment me not.

29. (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man: for many times it had caught him, and he had been kept bound with chains and fetters, and breaking the bands asunder, he had been driven by the spirit into the deserts.)

30. And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; because many devils had entered into him.

31. And they besought him, that he would not command them to go into the abyss.

32. And there was an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him, that he would suffer them to enter into them.

33. And he suffered them. Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a steep place into the lake and were choked.

34. And they that fed them, seeing what was done, fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.

35. Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

36. They also that had seen it told them, How he that was possessed by the devils was healed.

37. Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about, besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear, and he went in the vessel and returned.

38. And the man out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, Return home,

39. and shew what great things God hath done for thee. And he went and published through the whole city, how great things Jesus had done for him.

40. And when Jesus returned, the people gladly received him; for they were all waiting for him.

41. And behold there came a man named Jairus, and he was ruler of the synagogue; and falling down at the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house.

42. For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went, the people thronged him.

43. And a woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon Physicians, neither could be healed by any,

44. Came behind him and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her issue of blood stanched.

45. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

46. And Jesus said, Some one hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone out of me.

47. And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared to him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she had been healed immediately.

48. And he said to her, Daughter, take courage: thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

49. While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the master.

50. Jesus hearing it answered him, saying, Fear not; believe only, and she shall be made whole.

51. And coming into the house, he suffered none to go in, save Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden.

52. And all wept and bewailed her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead; but sleepeth.

53. And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

54. And he put them all out, and taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maid, arise.

55. And her spirit returned, and she arose straightway, and he commanded to give her meat.

56. And her parents were astonished: but he charged them, to tell no man that which had been done.

## Luke 9

1. And calling together the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases.

2. And he sent them to preach the gospel of the kingdom, and to heal the sick. And said to them, Take nothing for your journey,

3. neither staves, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money: neither have two coats apiece.

4. And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide and thence depart.

5. And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

6. And they departed, and went thro' the towns preaching the Gospel and healing every where.

7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him. And he was perplexed,

8. because it was said by some, That John was risen from the dead; and by some that Elijah had appeared; by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.

9. And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.

10. And the apostles returning told him what they had done. And he took them and went aside privately into the desert of Bethsaida.

11. And when the multitudes knew it, they followed him, and he received them and spake to them of the kingdom of God and healed them that had need of healing.

12. And the day began to decline. And the twelve coming to him said, send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge and find victuals: for we are here in a desert place.

13. But he said to them, give ye them to eat. And they said, we have no more than five loaves and two fishes, except we should go and buy meat for all this people.

14. For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down, by fifties in a company.

15. And they did so, and made them all sit down.

16. Then taking the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.

17. And they all ate and were satisfied, and there were taken up of fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

18. And as he was praying apart, his Disciples were with him. And he asked them saying, whom say the people that I am?

19. They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

20. He said to them, but whom say ye, that I am?

21. Peter answering said, The Christ of God. But he straitly charged and commanded them,

22. to tell this to no man, saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.

23. And he said to all, if any man be willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow me.

24. For who|oever will save his life shall gose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, he shall save it:

25. For what is a man profited, if he gain the whble world, and lose himself, or be cast away?

26. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's and that of the holy angels.

27. And I tell you of a truth there are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

28. And about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and James and John, and went up into a mountain to pray.

29. And as he prayed, the fashien of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.

30. And behold two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,

31. Who appearing in glory, spake of his decease, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.

32. But Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep; and awaking they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

33. And just as they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents, ane for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said.

34. While he spake thus, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they feared while they entered into the cloud.

35. And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear ye him.

36. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone: and they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.

37. And the next day, as they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.

38. And behold a man from the croud, cried aloud saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is my only child.

39. And lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him, that he foameth, and bruising him, hardly departeth from him.

40. And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.

41. And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring thy son hither.

42. And as he was yet coming, the devil threw him down and tore him: and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.

43. And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. And while they all wondered at all things which Jesus did,

44. he said to his disciples, Let these sayings sink down into your ears; for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.

45. But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of this saying.

46. And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest?

47. And Jesus seeing the thought of their heart, took a little child,

48. and sat him by him, And said to them, whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.

49. And John answering said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him; because he followeth not with us.

50. And Jesus said to him, forbid him not, for he that is not against you is for you.

51. And when the time was fulfilled, that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

52. And sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

53. But they did not receive him, because his face was, as tho' he would go to Jerusalem.

54. And his disciples James and John seeing it said, Lord, Wilt thou that we bid fire come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?

55. But he turning rebuked them and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of:

56. For the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.

57. And as they went in the way, one said to him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

58. But Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

59. And he said to another, Follow me.

60. But he said, Lord, Suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

61. And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but suffer me first to bid them farewell that are in my house.

62. Jesus said to him, No man having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

## Luke 10

1. After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two by two into every place, whither he himself intended to come.

2. And he said to them, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

3. Go: behold I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Carry not purse or scrip or shoes, and salute no man by the way.

5. And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.

6. And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

7. And remain in the same house eating and drinking such things as they have; for the labourer is worthy of his hire: go not from house to house.

8. And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.

9. And heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come nigh to you.

10. But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, going out into the streets of it, say,

11. Even the dust of your city which cleaveth to our feet, do we wipe off against you: yet know this, that the kingdom of God is at hand.

12. I say to you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.

13. Wo to thee, Chorazin, wo to thee Bethsaida; for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, which hast been exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.

16. He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me, rejecteth him that sent me.

17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us thro' thy name.

18. And he said to them, I beheld Satan falling as lightning from heaven.

19. Behold I give ydu power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy,

20. and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.

21. Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, that your names are written in heaven. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

22. All things are delivered to me of my Father; and no one knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him.

23. And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see.

24. For I tell you, many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

25. And behold, a certain scribe stood up, and trying him, said, Master, what shall I do, to inherit eternal life?

26. He said to him, What is written in the law?

27. How readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

28. And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do and thou shalt live.

29. But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour?

30. And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who having stripped and wounded him departed, leaving him half dead.

31. And it came to pass that a certain priest came down that way, and seeing him, passed by on the other side.

32. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Samaritan journeying, came where he was, and seeing him,

34. was moved with tender compassion, And going to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and setting him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. And on the morrow departing, he took out two pieces of money, and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, as I come back I will repay thee.

36. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was the neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?

37. And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go and do thou likewise.

38. And as they went, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house.

39. And she had a sister called Mary,

40. who also sitting at the feet of Jesus, heard his discourse. But Martha was incumbered with much serving; and coming to him she said, Lord, dost thou not care, that my sister hath left me to serve alone?

41. Bid her therefore help me. But Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha! Thou art careful and hurried about many things:

42. But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.

## Luke 11

1. And as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

2. And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done as in heaven, so on earth.

3. Give us day by day our daily bread.

4. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

5. And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves:

6. For a friend of mine on his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him:

7. And he from within shall answer, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed: I cannot rise and give thee?

8. I tell you, though he will not rise and give him,

9. because he is his friend, yet, because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you.

10. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.

11. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?

12. Or if he ask a fish, for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

13. If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

14. And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb: and when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake, and the people wondered.

15. But some of them said, He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils:

16. And others tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

17. But he knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falleth.

18. If Satan then be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand?

19. Because ye say, that I cast out devils by Beelzebub. And if I cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out?

20. Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out devils by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.

21. While the strong one armed guardeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But

22. when he that is stronger than him cometh upon him and overcometh him, he taketh from him his compleat armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.

23. He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.

24. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, seeking rest: and finding none, he saith, I will return to my house whence I came out.

25. And coming he findeth it swept and garnished.

26. Then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and entering in they dwell there; and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.

27. As he spake these things, a certain woman lifting up her voice out of the multitude said to him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked!

28. But he said, Yea, rather blessed are they, that hear the word of God and keep it.

29. And the multitudes being gathered thick together, he said, This is an evil generation: it seeketh a sign; but no sign shall be given it, save the sign of Jonah.

30. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

33. No man having lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.

34. The eye is the lamp of the body: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body is full of light, but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

35. Take heed therefore, left the light that is in thee be darkness.

36. If then thy whole body be full of light, not having any part dark, the whole shall be as full of light, as when a lamp enlightens thee with its bright shining.

37. And as he spake, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him.

38. And he went in and sat down to table. But the Pharisee seeing it, marvelled, that he had not first washed before dinner. And the Lord said to him,

39. Now ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the dish; but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness.

40. Ye unthinking men, did not he that made the outside, make the inside also?

41. But give what is in them in alms, and behold all things are clean to you.

42. But wo to you, Pharisees; for ye tythe mint and rue and all herbs; and pass by justice and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

43. Wo to you, Pharisees; for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues,

44. and salutations in the markets. Wo to you; for ye are as graves which appear not, and men that walk over them are not aware.

45. And one of the lawyers answering said to him, Master, thus saying, thou reproachest us also.

46. And he said, Wo to you lawyers also; for ye load men with burthens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burthens with one of your fingers.

47. Wo to you; for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets; whom your fathers killed.

48. Truly ye bear witness that ye approve the deeds of your fathers: for whom they killed, ye build their sepulchres.

49. Therefore also the wisdom of God hath said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will slay, and persecute the rest.

50. So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world, shall be required of this generation.

51. From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was destroyed between the temple and the altar: verily I say to you, it shall be required of this generation.

52. Woe to you, lawyers; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye have not entered in yourselves; and them that were entering in, ye have hindered.

53. And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began fiercely to fasten upon him, and to urge him to speak of many things,

54. Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

## Luke 12

1. In the mean time, an innumerable multitude being gathered together, so that they trod one upon another, he said to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For there is nothing covered that shall not be uncovered, neither hid, that shall not be made known:

3. So that whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness, shall be heard in the light, and what ye have whispered in closets shall be proclaimed on the house-tops.

4. But I say to you, my friends; Fear not them that kill the body, and after that can do no more:

5. But I will shew you whom ye shall fear: fear him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell: yea, I say to you, fear him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.

7. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

8. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. And I say to you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.

9. But he that denieth me before man, shall be denied before the angels of God.

10. And whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven.

11. But when they bring you to the synagogues and to magistrates and powers,

12. take no thought how or what ye shall answer or what ye shall say. For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that hour, what ye ought to say.

13. And one out of the croud said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

14. But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

15. And he said to them, Take heed and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.

16. And he spake a parable to them,

17. saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do?

18. For I have no room where to stow my fruits. And he said, This I will do: I will pull down my barns and build greater; and there will I stow all my fruits and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years: take thine ease; eat, drink, and be merry.

20. But God said to him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: and whose shall the things be that thou hast provided?

21. So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.

22. And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life what ye shall eat, neither for the body what ye shall put on.

23. The life is more than meat, and the body than raiment.

24. Consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor reap; neither have store-house nor barn: yet God feedeth them. How much better are ye than the birds?

25. And which of you by taking thought, can add the least measure to his age?

26. If ye then be not able to do that which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

28. If then God so cloth the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the still, how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?

29. And seek not ye, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of a doubtful mind.

30. For the nations of the world seek all these things; and your Father knoweth that ye need these things.

31. But seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.

32. Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell what ye have and give alms: provide yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

34. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

35. Let your loins be girt,

36. and your lamps burning, And be like men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the wedding, that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.

37. Happy are those servants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall find watching; verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to table, and will come forth and serve them.

38. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, happy are those servants.

39. And this ye know, that if the master of the house had known, what hour the thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broke open.

40. Therefore be ye also ready; for the Son of man cometh in an hour when ye think not.

41. Then Peter said to him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or also to all?

42. And the Lord said, Who is that faithful and wise steward, whom his Lord shall make ruler over his housoold, to give the allowance of food in due season?

43. Happy is that servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.

44. Verily I say to you, he will set him over all that he hath.

45. But if that servant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to beat the men servants and maidens, and to eat, and drink, and be drunken:

46. The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he expecteth not, and at an hour when he knoweth not, and will cut him in sunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.

47. And that servant who knew his Lord's will, and prepared not, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

48. But he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For to whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required; and to whom they have committed much, of him they will ask the more.

49. I am come to send fire on the earth.

50. And what do I desire? That it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to be baptized with: and how am I straitned till it be accomplished!

51. Suppose ye that I am come to send peace upon earth? I tell you, Nay, but rather division.

52. For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

54. And he said to the people also, When ye see a cloud rising out of the west, straitway ye say, There cometh a heavy shower, and so it is.

55. And when ye find the south wind blowing, ye say, There will be sultry heat; and it is so.

56. Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the earth and of the sky: how do ye not discern this season?

57. Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

58. When thou art going with thine adversary to the magistrate, give diligence in the way to be delivered from him: lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.

59. I tell thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence, till thou hast paid the last mite.

## Luke 13

1. And there were present at that season, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

2. And Jesus answering said to them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things;

3. I tell you, Nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them, suppose ye, that they were sinners above all that dwelt at Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, Nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

6. He spake also this parable.

7. A man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came, seeking fruit thereon and found none. Then said he to the keeper of the vineyard, Behold three years I come seeking fruit of this fig tree, and find aone: cut it down: why doth it also cumber the ground?

8. And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it and dung it.

9. Perhaps it may bear fruit: but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down.

10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

11. And behold, there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together and utterly unable to lift up herself.

12. And Jesus seeing her, called her to him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity.

13. And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

14. And the ruler of the synagogue, being much displeased, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, answered and said, There are six days, in which man ought to work: on these therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath.

15. The Lord answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each of you loose his ox or ass from the stall on the sabbath, and lead him away to watering!

16. And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound lo these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath?

17. And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

18. Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I resemble it?

19. It is like a grain of mustard-seed which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches of it.

20. Again he said, Whereto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which a woman took and covered up in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

22. And he went thro' the cities and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem.

23. Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that are saved?

24. And he said to him, Strive to enter in thro' the strait gate; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

25. When once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and knock at the door saying, Lord, Lord, open to us: He shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are.

26. Then shall ye say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

27. But he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

28. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.

29. And they shall come from the east and the west, and the north and the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

30. But behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.

31. The same day came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Go out and depart from hence; for Herod is minded to kill thee.

32. And he said to them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow; and the third day I am perfected.

33. But I must go on to day, and to morrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a bird gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!

35. Behold your house is left to you desolate; and verily I say to you, Ye shall not see me, till the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

## Luke 14

1. And as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the sabbath, to eat bread, they watched him.

2. And behold there was a certain man before him, who had the dropsy.

3. And Jesus answering spake to the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

4. But they held their peace. And he took him and healed him and let him go,

5. And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?

6. And they could not answer him again to these things.

7. And he spake a parable to them that were invited, when he marked how they chose the chief seats,

8. saying to them, When thou art invited by any man to a marriage-feast, sit not down in the highest place, lest a more honourable man than thou be invited by him,

9. And he that invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place. And then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when thou art invited,

10. go and sit down in the lowest place, that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit at table with thee. For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that

11. humbleth himself shall be exalted.

12. Then said he also to him that had invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours, lest they also invite thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

13. But when thou makest an entertainment, invite the poor,

14. the disabled, the lame, the blind, And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee; but thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

15. And one of them that sat at table with him, hearing these things, said to him, Happy is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

16. Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many.

17. And he sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.

18. And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a field, I must needs go and see it: I pray thee, have me excused.

19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

20. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

21. So the servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the disabled, and the lame, and the blind.

22. And the servant said, Sir, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is room.

23. And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

24. For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited, shall taste of my supper.

25. And great multitudes went with him. And he turned and said to them,

26. If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

27. And whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple.

28. And which of you intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and computeth the cost, whether he hath sufficient to finish it?

29. Lest haply after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold mock him,

30. saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

31. Or what king marching to incounter another king in war, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand, to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?

32. If not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an embassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

33. So every one of you, who forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.

34. Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?

35. It is neither fit for the land nor yet for dung; they cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

## Luke 15

1. Then drew near to him all the publicans and sinners, to hear him.

2. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying, This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them.

3. And he spake a parable to them, saying,

4. Who of you, having an hundred sheep, and losing one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, till he find it?

5. And having found it, he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing.

6. And coming home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.

7. I say to you, Thus joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, who do not need repentance.

8. Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?

9. And having found it, she calleth her friends and neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.

10. Thus, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God, over one sinner that repenteth.

11. And he said, A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father;

12. Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.

13. And he divided to them his substance. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and took a journey into a far country, and there squandered away his substance, living riotously.

14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.

15. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields, to feed swine.

16. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate: and no man gave to him.

17. And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger?

18. I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee:

19. I am no more worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.

20. And he arose and came to his father: But while he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and his bowels yearned, and he ran, and fell on his neck and kissed him.

21. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.

22. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.

23. And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.

24. For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.

25. And they began to be merry. Now his elder son was in the field. And as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

26. And calling one of the servants, he asked what these things meant?

27. And he told him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him in good health.

28. But he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father coming out intreated him.

29. And he answering said to his father, Lo these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I thy commandment at any time, yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.

30. But as soon as this thy son was come, who hath devoured thy substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

31. And he said to him, Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.

32. But it was meet to make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.

## Luke 16

1. And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and he was accused to him as wasting his goods.

2. And calling him, he said to him, Why hear I this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward.

3. And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? For my lord taketh away the stewardship from me. I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed.

4. I know what to do, that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

5. So having called to him every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?

6. And he said, An hundred measures of oil. He said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.

7. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? He said, An hundred measures of wheat. He saith, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.

8. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely; for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.

9. And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.

10. He that is faithful in the least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.

11. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will intrust you with the true riches?

12. And if ye have not been fauthful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?

13. No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or he will cleave to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.

14. And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard these things, and they derided him.

15. And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men: but God knoweth your hearts: And that which is highly esteemed among men, is an abomination before God.

16. The law and the Prophets were until John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man forceth into it.

17. Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than for one tittle of the law to fail.

18. Whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery.

19. There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted splendidly every day.

20. And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores;

21. and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table: yea, the dogs also came and licked his sores.

22. And the beggar died and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died and was buried:

23. And in hell lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Son, remember, that thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

26. And besides all this, between us and you, there is a great gulph fixed; so that they who would pass from us to you, cannot, neither can they pass to us that would come from thence.

27. Then he said, I pray thee, therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:

28. For I have five brethren; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

29. Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

30. And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.

31. And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded tho' one rose from the dead.

## Luke 17

1. Then said he to the disciples, It is impossible but offences will come; but wo to him through whom they come.

2. It were better for him that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

3. Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him.

4. And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day return to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. And the Lord said,

6. If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

7. But which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him as soon as he cometh from the field, Come and sit down to table?

8. And will not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

9. Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?

10. I think not. So likewise ye, when ye have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are but unprofitable servants: we have done what was our duty to do.

11. And as he went to Jerusalem, he passed thro' the confines of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten lepers, who stood afar off:

13. And they lifted up their voice and said, Jesus, master, have mercy on us.

14. And seeing them, he said to them, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God.

16. And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

17. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed?

18. But where are the nine? There are not found to give glory to God, save this stranger.

19. And he said to him, Arise and go, thy faith hath saved thee.

20. And being asked by the Pharisees, When cometh the kingdom of God, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God, cometh not with observation.

21. Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

22. And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.

23. And when they shall say to you, See here; see there: go not, nor follow them.

24. Ior as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven, so shall also the Son of man be in his day.

25. But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.

26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the son of man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

28. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded:

29. But the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.

30. Even thus shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.

31. In that day, he that shall be on the house-top and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

32. Remember Lot's wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life,

33. shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life, shall preserve it.

34. I tell you, in this night, there shall be two men in one bed; one shall be taken and the other left.

35. Two women shall be grinding together; one shall be taken and the other left.

36. Two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken and the other left.

37. And they answering said to him, Where Lord? And he said to them, Wheresoever the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

## Luke 18

1. And he spake a parable to them to this end, that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;

2. Saying, There was in a certain city a judge who feared not God nor reverenced man.

3. And there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, saying, Do me justice on mine adversary.

4. And he would not for a while, but afterwards he said in himself, Tho' I fear not God nor reverence man,

5. Yet because this widow giveth me trouble, I will do her justice, left by her continual coming she weary me out.

6. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith?

7. And shall not God vindicate his own elect, who cry to him day and night, though he bear long with them?

8. I tell you he will vindicate them speedily. Yet when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith upon earth?

9. And he spake this parable to certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others.

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

11. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed thus, God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.

12. I fast twice in the week: I give tythes of all that I possess.

13. And the publican standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.

14. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

15. And they brought to him infants also, that he might touch them; but the disciples seeing it, rebuked them.

16. But Jesus calling them to him, said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter therein.

18. And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

19. But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good?

20. There is none good save one, that is God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery. Do not murder, Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Honour thy father and thy mother.

21. And he said, All these have I kept from my childhood. Jesus hearing these things said to him, Yet lackest thou one thing:

22. Sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

23. And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful; for he was very rich.

24. And Jesus seeing that he was very sorrowful, said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God?

25. It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

27. And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God.

28. Then Peter said, Lo we have left all and followed thee.

29. And he said to them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,

30. for the kingdom of God's sake, Who shall not receive manifold more in the present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

31. Then he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets shall be accomplished on the Son of man.

32. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully intreated, and spitted on: And they shall scourge him, and put him to death:

33. and the third day he shall rise again.

34. And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

35. And while he was yet nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging.

36. And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked, what it meant?

37. And they told him, Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

38. And he cried aloud saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.

39. And they that went before charged him to hold his peace; but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.

40. And Jesus standing still, commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near,

41. he asked him, Saying, What wilt thou that I should do for thee? He said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

42. And Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight, thy faith hath saved thee.

43. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: And all the people seeing it gave praise to God.

## Luke 19

1. And he entered and passed through Jericho. And behold a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief of the publicans.

2. Now this was a rich man.

3. And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and could not for the croud, because he was little of stature.

4. And running before, he climbed into a sycamore tree, to see him, for he was to pass by that way.

5. And Jesus, when he came to the place, looking up saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.

6. And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.

7. And seeing it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone to be guest with a sinner.

8. And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man wrongfully, I restore him fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him, To day is salvation come to this house; forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

11. And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh Jerusalem, and because they thought the kingdom of God would immediately appear.

12. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.

13. And having called ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade till I come.

14. But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

15. And when he was returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, to know what each had gained by trading.

16. Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.

17. And he said to him, Well done, good servant; because thou hast been faithful in a very little, be thou governor over ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.

19. And he said to him likewise, Be thou also over five cities.

20. And another came saying, Lord, behold thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin.

21. For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layest not down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.

22. And he saith to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow.

23. Wherefore then gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have received it with interest?

24. And he said to them that stood by, Take the pound from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

25. (And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds!)

26. For I say unto you, To every one that hath shall be given: but from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away from him.

27. Moreover those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay before me.

28. And having said these things. he went before, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And as he drew nigh to Bethpage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives,

30. he sent two of his disciples, saying, Go ye into the village over against you, in which entering, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man yet sat; loose him and bring him hither.

31. And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him, thus shall ye say to him, The Lord hath need of him.

32. And they that were sent went, and found even as he had said to them.

33. And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them, Why loose ye the colt?

34. And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

35. And they brought him to Jesus, and they cast their garments on the colt and set Jesus thereon.

36. And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

37. And when he was now come nigh, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had seen,

38. Saying, Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

39. And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

40. And he answering said to them, I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

41. And as he drew near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,

42. saying, O that thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day the things that are for thy peace. But now they are hid from thine eyes.

43. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and press thee on every side,

44. And shall dash thee against the ground, and thy children, that are in thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

45. And going into the temple, he drove out them that sold and them that bought therein.

46. Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.

47. And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people, sought to destroy him,

48. And found not what they might do; for all the people hung upon him to hear him.

## Luke 20

1. And on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,

2. And spake to him saying, Tell us, by what authority dost thou these things, and who is he that gave thee this authority?

3. And he answering said, I will also ask you one thing and tell me, Was the baptism of John from heaven or of men?

4. And they reasoned among themselves,

5. saying, If we say from heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

6. But if we say of men, all the people will stone us;

7. for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

8. And they answered, They could not tell whence. Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you, by what authority I do these things.

9. Then he spake this parable to the people: A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.

10. And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they might give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat and sent him away empty.

11. And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

12. And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also, and cast him out.

13. Then said the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps seeing him they will reverence him.

14. But the husbandmen seeing him, reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: Come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

15. So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do to them?

16. He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.

17. And hearing it they said, God forbid. And he looked on them and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, this is become the head of the corner?

18. Whosoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

19. And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him the same hour; but they feared the people; for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.

20. And watching him, they sent forth spies, feigning themselves to be just men, to take hold of his discourse, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governour.

21. And they asked him, saying, Master, we know, that thou speakest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou persons, but teachest the way of God in truth:

22. Is it lawful for us, to give tribute to C?sar, or no?

23. But he observing their craftiness, said to them, Why tempt ye me?

24. Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answering said, C?sar's.

25. He said, Render therefore to C?sar the things which are C?sar's, and to God the things which are God's.

26. And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and marvelling at his answer, they held their peace.

27. Then certain of the Saducees, who deny there is any resurrection, coming to him asked him,

28. saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.

29. Now there were seven brethren, and the first took a wife, and died without children.

30. And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

31. And the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they died and left no children.

32. Last of all the woman died also. Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she?

33. For seven had her to wife.

34. And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage.

35. But they who are accounted worthy to obtaan that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.

36. For neither can they die any more; for they are equal to angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.

37. But that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord, The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; so that all live to him.

39. And some of the scribes answering said, Master, Thou hast spoken excellently well.

40. And after that, they durst not ask him any question at all.

41. And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David's son?

42. And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord,

43. Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

44. David therefore calleth him Lord: How is he then his son?

45. Then in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples, Beware of the scribes,

46. who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts,

47. Who devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater damnation.

## Luke 21

1. And looking up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury.

2. And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither tuo mites.

3. And he said, Of a truth I say to you, This poor widow hath cast in more than they all.

4. For all these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.

5. And as some spake of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts,

6. he said, As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

7. And they asked him saying, Master, when shall these things be? And what is the sign, when these things shall come to pass?

8. And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ: And the time is near.

9. Go ye not after them. And when ye shall hear of wars, and commotions, be not terrified; for these things must be first; but the end is not immediately.

10. Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines and pestilences, and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.

12. But before all these things they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake.

13. And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

14. Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to premeditate what to answer. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom,

15. which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or resist.

16. But ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.

17. And ye shall be hated by all men for my names sake.

18. But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

19. In your patience possess ye your souls.

20. And when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

21. Then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let them that are in the midst of it, depart out, and let not them that are in the countries, enter thereinto.

22. For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

23. But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days; for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath on this people.

24. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

25. And there shall be signs in the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea roaring and tossing:

26. Men fainting away for fear, and expectation of the things coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

27. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory.

28. Now when these things begin to come to pass, look up and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

29. And he spake a parable to them, Behold the fig-tree and all the trees.

30. When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of yourselves, that summer is now nigh.

31. So likewise when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is nigh.

32. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.

33. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away.

34. But take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overloaded with gluttony, and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

35. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.

36. Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things which will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. Now by day he was teaching in the temple; and at night going out he lodged at the mount called the mount of Olives.

38. And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.

## Luke 22

1. Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.

2. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; but they feared the people.

3. Then entered Satan into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

4. And he went and talked with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.

5. And they were glad and agreed to give him money.

6. And he promised and sought opportunity to betray him to them, in the absence of the multitude.

7. And the first day of unleavened bread was come, when the passover was to be killed.

8. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat it.

9. And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

10. And he said to them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, a man will meet you bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth.

11. And say to the master of the house, The master saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

12. And he will shew you a large upper-room furnished: there make ready.

13. And they went, and found as he had said to them. And they made ready the passover.

14. And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

15. And he said to them, With desire have I desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer.

16. For I say to you, I will not eat thereof any more, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And he took the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.

18. For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come.

19. And he took bread, and gave thanks and brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.

20. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you.

21. But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

22. And truly the Son of man goeth as it was determined; but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed.

23. And they inquired among themselves, Which of them it was, that would do this?

24. There was also a contention among them, Which of them was greatest.

25. And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they that exercise authority upon them have the title of benefactors.

26. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief as he that serveth.

27. For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.

28. Ye are they who have continued with in me in my temptations.

29. And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father to me,

30. That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.

32. But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not: and when thou art returned, strengthen thy brethren.

33. And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.

34. And he said, I tell thee, Peter, it shall not be the time of cockcrowing this day, before thou wilt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

35. And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing?

36. And they said, Nothing. Then said he to them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip; and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.

37. For I say to you, That this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

38. For the things concerning me have an end. And they said, Behold here are two swords. And he said to them, it is enough.

39. And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.

40. And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

41. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast,

42. and kneeling down, he prayed, saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.

43. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him.

44. And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down on the ground.

45. And rising up from prayer, he came to his disciples,

46. and found them sleeping for sorrow, And said to them, Why sleep ye? Rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

47. And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.

48. And Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?

49. When they who were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

50. And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. And Jesus answering said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him.

52. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, who were come to him, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?

53. When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour and the power of darkness.

54. Then took they him, and led him, and brought him to the high-priest's house.

55. And Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down together, Peter sat down among them.

56. But a certain maid seeing him as he sat by the light, and looking earnestly upon him, said, This man also was with him.

57. But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

58. And after a while another saw him and said, Thou art also of them.

59. And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean.

60. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou meanest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

61. And the Lord turning looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord,

62. how he had said to him, Before cock-crowing, thou wilt deny me thrice. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

63. And the men that held Jesus mocked and smote him. And having blindfolded him,

64. they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?

65. And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.

66. And when it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together,

67. and led him into their council, Saying, Art thou the Christ? Tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe.

68. And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

69. Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right-hand of the power of God.

70. And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God?

71. He said, Ye say it: I am. And they said, What farther need have we of witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.

## Luke 23

1. And the whole multitude of them arose and led him to Pilate.

2. And they accused him saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, saying, that he himself is Christ a king.

3. And Pilate asked him saying, Art thou the king of the Jews?

4. And he answering him said, Thou sayest. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and the multitude, I find no fault in this man.

5. But they were the more violent saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, to this place.

6. Pilate hearing of Galilee asked, If the man was a Galilean?

7. And when he knew, that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also in Jerusalem at that time.

8. And Herod seeing Jesus was exceeding glad; for he had been long desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.

9. And he questioned him in many words, but he answered him nothing.

10. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

11. And Herod, having with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a splendid robe, sent him back to Pilate.

12. And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

13. And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers,

14. and the people, Said to them, Ye have brought this man to me, as perverting the people; and behold, I having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man, touching the things whereof ye accuse him.

15. Nor yet Herod; for I sent you to him; and lo, he hath done nothing worthy of death.

16. I will therefore chastise and release him.

17. For he was under a necessity of releasing one to them at the feast.

18. And they cried all at once saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:

19. (Who for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder had been cast into prison.)

20. Pilate desiring to release Jesus, spake again to them.

21. But they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him. He said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done?

22. I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise and release him.

23. But they insisted with loud voices, requiring that he should be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.

24. And Pilate gave sentence, that what they desired should be done.

25. And he released to them him, that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

26. And as they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

27. And there followed him a great company of people and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.

28. But Jesus turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

29. For behold the days are coming in which they will say, Happy are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps that never gave suck.

30. Then shall they say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.

31. For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?

32. And there were also led two other men, malefactors, to be put to death with him.

33. And when they were come to the place, called the place of a scull, there they crucified him, and the two malefactors, one on the right-hand, and one on the left.

34. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment and cast lots.

35. And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others: let him save himself, if he be the Christ, the chosen of God.

36. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

37. And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

38. And a superscription also was written over him in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. And one of the malefactors, who were hanging on the cross, reviled him, saying, If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.

40. But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

41. And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this person hath done nothing amiss.

42. And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me, when thou comest in thy kingdom.

43. And Jesus said to him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

44. And it was about the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth till the ninth hour.

45. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

46. And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And having said thus, he expired.

47. And the centurion seeing what was done, glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

48. And all the people who had come together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, returned, smiting their breasts.

49. And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

50. And behold there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:

51. (He had not consented to the counsel and deed of them) of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God:

52. This man going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.

53. And taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

54. And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

55. And the women who had come with him from Galilee, following after, beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

56. And returning they prepared spices and ointments, and rested the sabbath, according to the commandment.

## Luke 24

1. And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices, which they had prepared and certain others with them.

2. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre, And entering, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

3. And while they were perplexed concerning it,

4. behold two men stood by them in shining garments.

5. And as they were afraid, and bowed down their face to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spake to you being yet in Galilee,

7. Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and rise again the third day.

8. And they remembered his words,

9. And returning from the sepulchre, told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.

10. It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.

11. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

12. But Peter rising, ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he seeth the linen clothes laid by themselves; and he went home, wondring at what was come to pass.

13. And behold two of them were going the same day to a village called Emmaus, which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem.

14. And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

15. And as they talked and argued together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.

16. But their eyes were holden, so that they did not know him.

17. And he said to them, What discourses are these that ye have one with another, and are sad?

18. And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Dost thou alone even sojourn at Jerusalem, and hast not known the things, which are come to pass there in these days?

19. And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Those concerning Jesus of Nazareth (who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,

20. ) How our chief priests and rulers delivered him to be condemned to death,

21. and have crucified him, But we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.

22. Yea, and certain women of our company astonished us, who were early at the sepulchre,

23. And not finding his body, they came, saying, That they had seen also a vision of angels, who say, he is alive.

24. And some of the men who were with us, went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said; but him they saw not.

25. Then he said to them, O foolish, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things in all the scriptures, concerning himself.

28. And they drew nigh the village whither they were going, and he made as tho' he would go farther.

29. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day declines.

30. And he went in, to abide with them. And as he sat at table with them, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake and gave to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.

32. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he was talking to us in the way, and opening the scriptures to us?

33. And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven met together, and them that were with them,

34. saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

35. And they told the things done in the way, and how he was known by them in the breaking of the bread.

36. And as they spake thus, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace be unto you.

37. But being terrified and affrighted, they thought they saw a spirit.

38. And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do reasonings arise in your hearts?

39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have.

40. And having spoken this, he shewed them his hands and his feet.

41. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any meat?

42. And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb.

43. And he took it, and ate before them.

44. And he said to them, These are the words which I spake to you, being yet with you, that all things written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms concerning me, must be fulfilled.

45. Then opened he their understanding,

46. to understand the scriptures, And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

47. And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. And ye are witnesses of these things. And behold I send the promise of my Father upon you:

49. but tarry in the city Jerusalem, till ye be clothed with power from on high.

50. And he led them out as far as Bethany; and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.

51. And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

52. And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

53. And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
