# 2 John

## 2 John 1

1. The elder unto the elect Kuria and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but likewise all who know the truth, For the truth's sake,

2. which abideth in us, and shall be with us for ever.

3. Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

4. I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in the truth, as we received commandment from the Father.

5. And now I beseech thee, Kuria, (not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the beginning ) that we may love one another.

6. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye may walk in it.

7. For many seducers are entered into the world, who confess not Jesus Christ that came in the flesh.

8. This is the seducer and the antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not the things we have wrought, but receive a full reward.

9. Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God:

10. he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If any come to you, and bring not this doctrine,

11. receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed. For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evil deeds.

12. Having many things to write to you, I was not minded to write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

13. The children of thy elect sister salute thee. Amen.
