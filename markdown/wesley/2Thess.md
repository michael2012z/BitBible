# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

2. Grace be unto you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.

4. So that we ourselves glory of you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and sufferings which ye endure:

5. A manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be accounted, worthy of the kingdom of God; for which also ye suffer.

6. Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recompence affliction to them that afflict you.

7. And to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels,

8. In flaming fire, taking vengeance on them who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,

10. When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all that believe (now that our testimony was believed among you) in that day.

11. To this end we pray always for you, that our God would make you worthy of this calling, and fulfill in you all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power;

12. That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. Now I beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,

2. and our gathering together unto him, That ye be not soon shaken in mind or terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.

3. Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come, unless the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,

4. Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God as God, declaring himself that he is God.

5. Remember ye not, that I told you these things, when I was yet with you?

6. And now ye know that which with-holdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.

7. For the mystery of iniquity already worketh; only he that with-holdeth will with-hold, till he be taken out of the way.

8. And then will that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming:

9. Whose coming is after the mighty working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders,

10. And with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

11. And therefore God shall send them strong delusion, so that that they shall believe a lie,

12. That they all may be condemned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

13. But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation, thro' sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.

14. To which he hath called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions, which ye have been taught, whether by word, or by our Epistle.

16. Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even our Father, who hath loved us and given us everlasting consolation and good hope thro' grace,

17. Comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as among you:

2. And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all men have not faith.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who will stablish and guard you from the evil one.

4. And we trust in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.

5. And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and the patience of Christ.

6. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received of us.

7. For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you,

8. Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing, but wrought with labour and toil, night and day, that we might not burden any of you.

9. Not because we have not power; but that we might make ourselves an example to you, that ye might imitate us.

10. For when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.

11. For we hear there are some among you who walk disorderly, doing nothing, but being busy-bodies.

12. Now such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, to work quietly and eat their own bread.

13. And ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

14. And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

15. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

16. Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.

17. The Lord be with you all.

18. The Salutation of Paul, with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
