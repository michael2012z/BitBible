# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in things concerning the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is after godliness,

2. In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began;

3. And he hath in due time manifested his word, thro' the preaching wherewith I am intrusted, according to the commandment of God our Saviour:

4. To Titus my own son after the common faith, grace, mercy, peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

5. For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest set in order the things which remain, and ordain elders in every city, as I appointed thee:

6. If a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of luxury or unruly.

7. For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, no striker, not desirous of filthy gain:

8. But a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, prudent, just, holy, temperate, Holding fast the faithful word,

9. as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

10. For there are many unruly vain-talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision,

11. Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole families, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of filthy gain.

12. One of themselves, a prophet of their own, hath said, The Cretans are always liars, evil wild-beasts, lazy gluttons.

13. This witness is true; therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

14. Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.

15. To the clean all things are clean; but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is clean; but both their understanding and conscience are defiled.

16. They profess to know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and void of judgment as to every good work.

## Titus 2

1. But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine, That the aged men be vigilant,

2. serious, prudent, sound in faith, love, patience:

3. That the aged women in like manner, be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things:

4. That they instruct the young women to be wise, to love their husbands,

5. to love their chidren, Discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

6. The young men likewise exhort to be discreet, In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works,

7. in doctrine, uncorruptness, seriousness, Sound speech that cannot be reproved;

8. that he who is on the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.

9. Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, to please them in all things,

10. not answering again, Not stealing, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may in all things adorn the gospel of God our Saviour.

11. For the saving grace of God hath appeared to all men,

12. Teaching us, that, having renounced ungodliness and all wordly desires, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present world,

13. Looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ.

14. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

15. These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority: let no man despise thee.

## Titus 3

1. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work:

2. To speak evil of no man, not to be quarrelsome, to be gentle, shewing all meekness toward all men.

3. For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, inslaved to various desires and pleasures, living in wickedness and envy, hateful, hating one another:

4. But when the kindness and philanthropy of God our Saviour appeared,

5. Not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.

6. Which he poured forth richly upon us,

7. through Jesus Christ our Saviour, That, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life.

8. This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, to the end that they who have believed in God, be careful to excel in good works: these things are good and profitable to men.

9. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

10. An heretic after a first and second admonition reject,

11. Knowing that such an one is perverted and sinneth, being self-condemned.

12. When I shall send Artemas or Tychicus to thee, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis; for I have determined to winter there.

13. Send forward with diligence Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, that they may want nothing.

14. And let ours also learn to excell in good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.

15. All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
