# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew his servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified them by his angel to his servant John,

2. Who hath testified the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things which he saw.

3. Happy is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein: for the time is near.

4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia; Grace be unto you, and peace from him who is, and who was, and who cometh, and from the seven Spirits that are before the throne,

5. And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first begotten from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth:

6. To him that loved us, and hath washed us from our sins with his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto his God and Father, to him be the glory and the might for ever.

7. Behold he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they who have pierced him: and all the tribes of the earth shall wail because of him.

8. Yea. Amen. I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who cometh, the Almighty.

9. I John, your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom, and patience of Jesus, was in the island Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.

10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,

11. and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet, Saying, what thou seest, write in a book and send to the seven churches, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me; and being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks, And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one,

13. like a son of man, cloathed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breast with a golden girdle.

14. His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow,

15. and his eyes as a flame of fire, And his feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the voice of many waters.

16. And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.

17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead: and he laid his right-hand upon me, saying, Fear not, I am the First and the Last,

18. And he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of Hades.

19. Write the things which thou hast seen, and which are, and which shall be hereafter:

20. The mystery of the stars which thou sawest in my right hand and of the seven golden candlesticks. The stars are angels of the churches: and the candlesticks are seven churches.

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel of the church at Ephesus write, These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right-hand, that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.

2. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, that thou canst not bear evil men; and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars: And hast patience,

3. and hast borne for my name's sake, and hast not fainted.

4. But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love.

5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: if not, I come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, unless thou repent.

6. But thou hast this, that thou hatest the works of the Nicola?tans, which I also hate.

7. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.

8. And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write, These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive.

9. I know thy affliction and poverty, (but thou art rich) and the reviling of those who say they are Jews and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.

10. Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer: behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried, and ye shall have affliction ten days: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.

11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death.

12. And to the angel of the church at Pergamos write, These things saith he who hath the sharp two-edged sword.

13. I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan is; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, in the days wherein Antipas, my faithful witness was, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

14. But I have a few things against thee, that thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.

15. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicola?tans, which I hate.

16. Repent therefore; if not, I come to thee, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

17. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh will I give of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which none knoweth, but he that receiveth it.

18. And to the angel of the church at Thyatira write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass.

19. I know thy love and faith, and thy service and patience, and thy last works more than the first.

20. But I have against thee, that thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, who callest herself a prophetess, and teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.

21. And I gave her time to repent of her fornication; but she will not repent.

22. Behold I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her, into great affliction, unless they repent of her works.

23. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know, that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give you, every man, according to your works.

24. But I say to you, the rest that are at Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will lay upon you no other burden.

25. But what ye have, hold fast till I come.

26. And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.

27. (And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces) as I also have received from my Father.

28. And I will give him the morning star.

29. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

## Revelation 3

1. And to the angel of the church at Sardis write, These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars, I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, but art dead.

2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, which are ready to die; for I have not found thy works compleat before my God.

3. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and repent. If thou watch not, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee.

4. Yet thou hast a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: they are worthy.

5. He that overcometh, he shall be cloathed in white raiment, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name, before my Father and before his angels.

6. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

7. And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia write, These things saith the Holy, the True One, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and none shutteth, and shutteth and none openeth.

8. I know thy works, (behold I have given before thee an opened door, none can shut it) that thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

9. Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them come and lie down before thy feet, and know that I have loved thee.

10. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee, from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

11. I come quickly. Hold fast what thou hast, that none take thy crown.

12. He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.

13. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches.

14. And to the angel of the church at Laodicea write, These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.

15. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: O that thou wert cold or hot!

16. So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot; I will spue thee out of my mouth.

17. Because thou sayst, I am rich, and have inriched myself, and have need of nothing, and knowest not, that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified in the fire, that thou mayst be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayst be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayst see.

19. Whomsoever I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous and repent.

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.

21. He that overcometh, I will give him to sit with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.

22. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

## Revelation 4

1. After this I saw, and behold a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, as of a trumpet talking with me, said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

2. And immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne.

3. And he that sat, was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone; and a rainbow was round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.

4. And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones, and on the thrones four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and upon their heads crowns of gold.

5. And out of the throne go forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire burn before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

6. And before the throne is a sea as of glass, like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.

7. And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature was like a calf, and the third living creature had a face as a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.

8. And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; round about and within they are full of eyes: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who cometh.

9. And when the living creatures give glory, and honour, and thanks, to him that sitteth upon the throne,

10. that liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sitteth upon the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne,

11. saying, Worthy art thou, O Lord our God, to receive the glory, and the honour, and the power, for thou hast created all things, and through thy will they are, and were created.

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw in the right-hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?

3. And none in heaven, or in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

4. And I wept much, that none was found worthy to open the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith to me, Weep not;

5. behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and the seals thereof.

6. And I beheld in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as if he had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.

7. And he came and took the book out of the right-hand of him that sat upon the throne.

8. And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one an harp, and golden phials full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,

10. And hast made them unto our God kings and priests, and they shall reign over the earth.

11. And I saw and heard a voice of many angels, round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,

12. Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power, and the riches, and the wisdom,

13. and the strength, and the honour, and the glory, and the blessing. And every creature which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that are in them, I heard them all saying, To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, is the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the power, for ever and ever.

14. And the four living creatures said Amen: and the elders fell down and worshiped.

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as the voice of thunder, Come and see.

2. And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.

3. And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.

4. And there went forth another horse that was red; and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another; and there was given him a great sword.

5. And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come. And I saw, and behold a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine.

7. And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.

8. And I saw and behold a pale horse, and he that sat on him, his name was Death, (and Hades followeth even with him) and power was given him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the scimetar, and with famine, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth.

9. And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.

10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, thou Holy One and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?

11. And there was given to them, to every one, a white robe; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a time, till their fellow servants also and their brethren should be fulfilled, who should be killed even as they were.

12. And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun was black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon was as blood;

13. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casteth its untimely figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind:

14. And the heaven departed as a book that is rolled together, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

15. And the kings of the earth, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave, and every free man hid themselves in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains:

16. And said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and cover us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.

17. For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?

## Revelation 7

1. And after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds, that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

2. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,

3. Saying, Hurt ye not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of them that were sealed; an hundred forty four thousand were sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Israel.

5. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand,

6. Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Napthali were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand,

7. Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand,

8. Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

9. After this I saw, and behold a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in their hands.

10. And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb.

11. And all the angels stood round about the throne and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God saying, Amen:

12. the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, be to our God for ever and ever.

13. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these that are cloathed in white robes? and whence are they come? And I said to him, My lord, thou knowest.

14. And he said to me, These are they who come out of great affliction, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

15. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that sitteth upon the throne shall have his tent over them.

16. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

17. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them, and will lead them to living fountains of water: and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.

## Revelation 8

1. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels which stand before God, and seven trumpets were given them.

3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given him, that he might place it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the incense came up before God out of the angels hand with the prayers of the saints.

5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it upon the earth, and there were thunderings, and lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake.

6. And the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound.

7. And the first sounded, and there was hail, and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all the green grass was burnt up.

8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire, was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood,

9. And the third part of the creatures that were in the sea which had life died, and the third part of the ships was destroyed.

10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp, and it fell on the third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters.

11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and many men died of the waters, because they were bitter.

12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for the third part thereof,

13. and the night likewise, And I saw and heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Wo, wo, wo to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels who are yet to sound.

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star falling from heaven upon the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.

2. And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.

3. And out of the smoke there went forth locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power:

4. And it was commanded them, not to hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.

5. And it was given them, not to kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and the torment of them is as the torment of a scorpion, when he stingeth a man.

6. And in those days the men shall seek death, but not find it; and shall desire to die, but death will flee from them.

7. And the appearances of the locusts are like horses made ready for battle; and on their heads are as it were crowns like gold, and their faces are as the faces of men,

8. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.

9. And they had breast-plates as it were breast-plates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.

10. And they have tails like scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their power is, to hurt men five months.

11. And they have over them a king, the angel of the bottomless pit: his name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek he hath the name Apollyon.

12. One wo is past: behold there come yet two woes after this.

13. And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four corners of the golden altar which is before God,

14. Saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for the hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill the third part of men.

16. And the number of the army of horsemen was two hundred millions: I heard their number.

17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them, having breast-plates of fire and hyacinth and brimstone: and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths goeth fire, and smoke and brimstone.

18. By these three plagues were the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone which went out of their mouths.

19. For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt.

20. And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood, which can neither hear, nor see, nor walk:

21. Neither repented of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon his head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.

2. And he had in his hand a little book opened, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth.

3. And he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth; and while he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

4. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not.

5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his right hand toward heaven,

6. And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, There shall be no more a time.

7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound, the mystery of God shall be fulfilled, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake with me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who standeth on the sea and on the earth.

9. And I went to the angel, saying to him, Give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take and eat it up, and it will make thy belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in thy mouth.

10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

11. And he saith to me, Thou must prophesy again concerning people, and nations, and tongues, and many kings.

## Revelation 11

1. And there was given me a reed, like a measuring rod; and he said, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.

2. But the court which is without the temple cast out and measure it not: for it is given to the Gentiles: and they shall tread the holy city forty two months.

3. And I will give to my two witnesses to prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.

5. And if any one would hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies, and if any would kill them, he must thus be killed.

6. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophesying, and have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.

7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the wild beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war with them, and conquer them, and kill them.

8. And their dead bodies shall be in the street of the great city, which is called spiritual Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified,

9. And some of the people, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall behold their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in a grave.

10. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall make merry, and send gifts to one another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.

11. And after the three days and an half, the spirit of life from God came into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that saw them.

12. And I heard a great voice saying from heaven to them, Come up hither. And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.

13. And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were slain in the earthquake seven thousand men, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14. The second wo is past: behold the third wo cometh quickly.

15. And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.

16. And the four and twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,

17. Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who is, and who was, because thou hast taken thy great power, and hast reigned.

18. And the nations were wroth: and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they be judged, and to give a reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, small and great, and to destroy them that destroyed the earth.

19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of the covenant was seen in the temple, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.

## Revelation 12

1. And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.

2. And being with child she crieth, travailing in birth and pained to be delivered.

3. And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads.

4. And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and casteth them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, that when she had brought forth, he might devour the child.

5. And she brought forth a man child, who shall rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that they may feed her twelve hundred and sixty days.

7. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels:

8. And he prevailed not, neither was his place found any more in heaven.

9. And the great dragon was cast out, the antient serpent, who is called the devil and satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out unto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come the salvation, and the might, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is cast out, who accused them before our God day and night.

11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

12. Therefore rejoice ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them: Wo to the earth and the sea; for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath; because he knoweth he hath but a little time.

13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman that had brought forth the male child.

14. And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is fed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.

16. But the earth helped the woman, and opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river which the dragon had cast out of his mouth.

17. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went forth to make war with the rest of her seed who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus.

## Revelation 13

1. And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a wild beast, coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads a name of blasphemy.

2. And the wild beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.

3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and the whole world wondered after the wild beast, And worshiped the dragon,

4. because he gave the authority to the wild beast; and worshiped the wild beast, saying, Who is like the wild beast? and who can war with him?

5. And there was given him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy, and authority was given him forty and two months.

6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, even them that dwell in heaven.

7. And it was given him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and authority was given him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.

8. And all that dwell upon the earth will worship him, whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb, who was slain, from the foundation of the world.

9. If any one have an ear, let him hear.

10. If any leadeth into captivity, he goeth into captivity: if any man kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faithfulness of the saints.

11. And I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, but he spake like a dragon;

12. And he exerciseth all the authority of the first wild beast before him; and he caused the earth, and them that dwelt therein, to worship the first wild beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

13. And he doth great wonders, so that he even maketh fire to come down out of heaven on the earth in the sight of men.

14. And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the wonders which it is given him to do before the wild beast: saying to them that dwell on the earth, to make an image to the wild beast, which had the wound by the sword, and yet lived.

15. And it was given him to give breath to the image of the wild beast; so that the image of the wild beast should speak: and he will cause, that as many as will not worship the image of the wild beast shall be killed.

16. And he causeth all, small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slaves, to receive a mark in their right-hand, or in their forehead,

17. That no man might buy or sell, but he that had the mark, the name of the wild beast, or the number of his name.

18. Here is the wisdom. Let him that hath an understanding count the number of the wild beast: for it is the number of a man: and his number is six hundred sixty six.

## Revelation 14

1. And I saw and behold a Lamb standing on mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice out of heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as a voice of a great thunder; and the voice which I heard was as of harpers harping on their harps.

3. And they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and none could learn the song but the hundred forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.

4. These are they who had not been defiled with women; for they are virgins: these are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were bought from among men: first-fruits to God and the Lamb.

5. And in their mouth there was found no guile: they are without fault.

6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having an everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation,

7. and tribe, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and fountains of water.

8. And another angel followed, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen; she that hath made all nations drink of the wine of her fornication.

9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the wild beast and his image, and receive his mark on his forehead or on his head,

10. He shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured unmixt into the cup of his indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.

11. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever, and they have no rest day or night, who worship the wild beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

12. Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying to me, Write: From henceforth happy are the dead who die in the Lord: Yea (saith the Spirit) that they may rest from their labours. Their works follow them.

14. And I saw and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud sat one like a son of man, having a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.

15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle and reap; for the time to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

16. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle, and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven; and he also had a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel from the altar, who had power over fire, cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

19. And the angel thrust in his sickle upon the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.

20. And the wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the horses bridles, one thousand six hundred furlongs.

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in heaven great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for by them the wrath of God is fulfilled.

2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that gained the victory over the wild beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing at the sea of glass, and having the harps of God.

3. And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, O King of the nations?

4. Who would not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou only art gracious: for all the nations shall come and worship before thee: for thy judgments are made manifest.

5. After this I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in heaven:

6. And the seven angels that had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure, white linen, and having their breasts girt with golden girdles.

7. And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden phials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever.

8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power: and none could go into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go, pour out the seven phials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

2. And the first went and poured out his phial upon the earth, and there came a grievous sore on the men that had the mark of the wild beast, and that worshiped his image.

3. And the second poured out his phial upon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man, and every living soul in the sea died.

4. And the third poured out his phial on the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art, and who wast, the Gracious one, because thou hast judged thus.

6. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink. They are worthy.

7. And I heard another from the altar, saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty; true and righteous are thy judgments.

8. And the fourth poured out his phial upon the sun; and it was given him to scorch the men with fire.

9. And the men were scorched exceedingly, and blasphemed the name of God, who had power over these plagues: but they repented not to give him glory.

10. And the fifth poured out his phial upon the throne of the wild beast; and his kingdom was darkened.

11. And they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains, and because of their sores, and repented not of their works.

12. And the sixth poured out his phial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.

13. And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the wild beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs (They are spirits of devils,

14. working miracles) go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them unto the battle of the great day of God, the Almighty.

15. (Behold I come as a thief. Happy is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.)

16. And they gathered them together to the place which is called in the Hebrew Armageddon.

17. And the seventh poured out his phial upon the air, and there went forth a loud voice out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done.

18. And there were lightnings, and voices, and a great earthquake; such as had not been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.

19. And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the Great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

20. And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.

21. And a great hail, every hail-stone about the weight of a talent, falleth out of heaven upon the men; and the men blasphemed God, because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.

## Revelation 17

1. And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven phials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the judgment of the great whore, that sitteth upon many waters:

2. With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.

3. And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet wild beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornification:

5. And on her forehead a name written, Mystery; Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth.

6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw, I wondered exceedingly.

7. And the angel said to me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.

8. The wild beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth, (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder when they behold the wild beast, that he was, and is not, and yet will be.

9. Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sitteth,

10. And they are seven kings: five are fallen: one is, the other is not yet come; when he cometh, he must continue a short space.

11. And the wild beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

12. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not received the kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast.

13. These have one mind, and give their power and authority to the wild beast.

14. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

15. And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the wild beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

17. For God hath put it into their hearts, to fulfill his will, and to agree and to give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God shall be fulfilled.

18. And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.

## Revelation 18

1. And after this I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great power, and the earth was inlightned with his glory.

2. And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become an habitation of devils, and an hold of every unclean spirit, and an hold of every unclean beast, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.

3. For all nations have drank of the wine of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich, thro' the abundance of her delicacies.

4. And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.

5. For her sins have reached even to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.

6. Reward her even as she hath rewarded, and give her double according to her works; in the cup which she filled, fill to her double.

7. As much as she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: because she saith in her heart, I sit as a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

8. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and sorrow, and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

9. And the kings of the earth, who had committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall weep and mourn over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,

10. Standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas! Thou great city Babylon, thou strong city! In one hour is thy judgment come.

11. And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her; for none buyeth their merchandize any more; Merchandize of gold,

12. and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all sorts of thyine wood, and all sorts of vessels of ivory, and all sorts of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;

13. And cinnamon, and amomum, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep; and merchandize of horses and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men.

14. And the fruits which thy soul desireth are departed from thee, and all things that were dainty and splendid are perished from thee and thou shalt find them no more.

15. The merchants of these things who became rich by her, shall stand afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, Saying, alas, alas!

16. The great city that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stone, and pearl: in one hour so great riches are become desolate.

17. And every ship-master, and all the company belonging to ships, and sailors, and all who trade by sea,

18. stood afar off, And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city was like the great city?

19. And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas! The great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness; for in one hour she is made desolate.

20. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and apostles, and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

21. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mill-stone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

22. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee, and no artificer of any kind shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of a mill-stone shall be heard no more at all in thee.

23. And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee, and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants, were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.

24. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and saints, and of all that had been slain upon the earth.

## Revelation 19

1. After this I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah: The salvation, and the glory, and the power to our God.

2. For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand,

3. (And again they said Hallelujah) and her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.

4. And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down, and worshiped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah.

5. And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, small and great.

6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord God, the Almighty reigneth.

7. Let us be glad and rejoice and give the glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

8. And it is given to her, to be arrayed in fine linen, white and clean; the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.

9. And he saith to me, Write: Happy are they who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me, These are the true sayings of God.

10. And I fell before his feet to worship him: but he saith to me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

11. And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sitteth on him, called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he judgeth and maketh war.

12. His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems, and he hath a name written, which none knoweth but himself.

13. And he is clothed in a vesture dipt in blood, and his name is called, The Word of God.

14. And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in clean, fine linen.

15. And out of his mouth goeth forth a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he may smite the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.

16. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.

17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together to the great supper of God,

18. That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chief captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those that sit on them, and the flesh of all men both bond and free, both small and great.

19. And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together, to make war with him that sat on the horse and with his army.

20. And the wild beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought the miracles before him, with which he deceived them who had the mark of the wild beast, and them who had worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.

21. And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which went forth out of his mouth; and all the birds were satisfied with their flesh.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel descending out of heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.

2. And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

3. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he might deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled. After this he must be loosed for a small time.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them; and I saw the souls of them who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the wild beast nor his image, neither had received the mark on their forehead or on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

5. The rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.

6. Happy and holy is he that hath a part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years are fulfilled, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

8. And shall go forth to deceive the nations, which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.

9. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.

10. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where both the wild beast and the false prophet are: and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat thereon, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

12. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things that were written in the books, according to their works.

13. And the sea gave up the dead that were therein; and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them; and they were judged every one according to their works.

14. And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death.

15. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away: and there was no more sea.

2. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride, adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle of God with men, and he will dwell with them; and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them and be their God.

4. And he shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall sorrow, or crying, or pain, be any more; because the former things are gone away.

5. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And he saith to me, Write: these sayings are faithful and true.

6. And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely.

7. He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be to him a God, and he shall be to me a son.

8. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

9. And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven phials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

10. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,

11. Having the glory of God: her window was like the most precious stone, like a jasper stone,

12. clear as crystal, Having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and the names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: On the east three gates,

13. and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.

14. And the walls of the city had twelve foundations, and upon them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he that talked with me had a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the walls thereof.

16. And the city lyeth four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs: the length, and the breadth, and the height of it, are equal.

17. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred forty-four reeds, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.

18. And the building of the wall thereof was jasper, and the city was of pure gold, like clear glass.

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was a jasper, the second a sapphire,

20. the third a chalcedony, the fourth an emerald, The fifth a sardonyx, the sixth a sardius, the seventh a chrysolite, the eighth a beryl, the ninth a topaz, the tenth a chrysophrase, the eleventh a jacinth, the twelfth an amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.

22. And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

23. And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God hath inlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.

24. And the nations shall walk by the light thereof; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.

25. And the gates of it shall not be shut by day: and there shall be no night there.

26. And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it.

27. But there shall in no wise enter into it any thing common, or that worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

## Revelation 22

1. And he shewed me a river of the water of life clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

2. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river is the tree of life, bearing twelve sorts of fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

3. And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall worship him,

4. And shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads.

5. And there shall be no night there, neither is there need of a lamp, or of the light of the sun; for the Lord God will give them light, and they shall reign for ever.

6. And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: the Lord the God of the holy prophets hath sent his angel, to shew his servants the things which must be done shortly.

7. Behold, I come quickly: happy is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.

8. And it was I John, who heard and saw these things; and when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who shewed me these things.

9. But he saith to me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the sayings of this book; worship God.

10. And he saith to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: the time is nigh.

11. He that is unrighteous, let him be unrighteous still; and he that is filthy let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still, and he that is holy, let him be holy still.

12. Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to render to every one as his work shall be.

13. I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

14. Happy are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.

15. Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.

16. I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you, to the churches, these things. I am the root and the off-spring of David, the bright, the morning-star. And the spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.

17. And let him that thirsteth, come: let him that willeth, take the water of life freely.

18. I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man add to them, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book.

19. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part of the tree of life, and the holy city, which are written in this book.

20. He that testifieth these things saith, Yea, I come quickly. Amen: Come, Lord Jesus!

21. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all.
