# Jude

## Jude 1

1. Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are beloved of God the Father, and preserved through Jesus Christ,

2. and called, Mercy unto you, and peace, and love be multiplied.

3. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you and exhort you, to contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.

4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were of old described before with regard to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

5. I am therefore willing to remind you, who once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

6. And the angels, who kept not their first dignity, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.

7. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, which in the same manner with these gave themselves over to fornication, and went after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

8. In like manner these dreamers also defile the flesh, despise authority, rail at dignities.

9. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil, he disputed concerning the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

10. But these rail at all the things which they know not: and all the things which they know naturally, as the brute beasts, in these they are defiled.

11. Wo to them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.

12. These are spots in your feasts of love, while they banquet with you feeding themselves without fear: clouds without water, driven about of winds; trees without leaves, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

13. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

14. And of these also, Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his holy ones,

15. To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have impiously committed, and of all the grievous things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

16. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own desires, and their mouth speaketh great swelling things, having mens persons in admiration for advantage.

17. But ye, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.

18. For they told you, In the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly desires.

19. These are they who separate themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit.

20. But ye, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying thro' the Holy Spirit.

21. Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

22. And some, that are wavering, convince; Some save, snatching them out of the fire;

23. on others have compassion with fear, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

24. Now to Him who is able to keep you from falling, and to preserve you faultless in the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,

25. To the only God, our Saviour, be glory, and majesty, might and authority, both now and to all ages. Amen.
