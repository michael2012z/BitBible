# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1. Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,

2. and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in your house:

3. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!

4. I give thanks to my God, always making mention of you in my prayers,

5. hearing of your love and faith that you have unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,

6. that the fellowship of your faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that is in you toward Christ Jesus;

7. for we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the affections of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.

8. Therefore, having in Christ much boldness to command you that which is fit --

9. because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;

10. I entreat you concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,

11. who once was to you unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to you,

12. whom I did send again, and you him (that is, my own affections) receive,

13. whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,

14. and apart from your mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity your good deed may not be, but of willingness,

15. for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly you may have him,

16. no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord!

17. If, then, with me you have fellowship, receive him as me,

18. and if he did hurt to you, or does owe anything, this to me be reckoning;

19. I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I may not say that also yourself, besides, to me you do owe.

20. Yes, brother, may I have profit of you in the Lord; refresh my affections in the Lord;

21. having been confident in your obedience I did write to you, having known that also above what I may say you will do;

22. and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.

23. Salute you does Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)

24. Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!

25. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit! Amen.
