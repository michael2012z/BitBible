# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,

2. to Timothy, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord!

3. I am thankful to God, whom I serve from ancestors in a pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my supplications night and day,

4. desiring greatly to see you, being mindful of your tears, that with joy I may be filled,

5. taking remembrance of the unfeigned 

6. For which cause I remind you to stir up 

7. for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind;

8. therefore you may not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do you suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God,

9. who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages,

10. and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news,

11. to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations,

12. for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to him to guard -- to that day.

13. The pattern 

14. the good thing committed guard you through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us;

15. you have known this, that they did turn from me -- all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes;

16. may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because many times he did refresh me, and of my chain was not ashamed,

17. but being in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found;

18. may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister you do very well know.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,

2. and the things that you heard from me through many witnesses, these things be committing 

3. you, therefore, suffer evil 

4. no one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that him who enlisted him he may please;

5. and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;

6. the laboring husbandman 

7. Consider what things I say, for the Lord will give to you understanding in all things.

8. Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,

9. in which I suffer evil 

10. because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that is in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.

11. Stedfast 

12. if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together; if we deny him, he also shall deny us;

13. if we are not stedfast 

14. These things remind them of, testifying fully before the Lord -- not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing;

15. be diligent to present yourself approved to God -- a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;

16. and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,

17. and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,

18. who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;

19. sure, nevertheless, has the foundation of God stood, having this seal, 'The Lord has known those who are His,' and 'Let him depart from unrighteousness -- every one who is naming the name of Christ.'

20. And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:

21. if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master -- to every good work having been prepared,

22. and the youthful lusts flee you, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;

23. and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,

24. and a servant of the Lord it benefits not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,

25. in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,

26. and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. And this know you, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,

2. for men 

3. without natural affection 

4. traitors, heady 

5. having a form 

6. for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden 

7. always learning, and 

8. and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against 

9. but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest 

10. And you -- you have followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering 

11. the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,

12. and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,

13. and evil men 

14. And you -- be remaining in the things which you did learn and were entrusted 

15. and because from a babe 

16. every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright 

17. that the man 

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign --

2. preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,

3. for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the hearing,

4. and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside.

5. And you -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of your ministration make full assurance,

6. for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release has arrived;

7. the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept,

8. henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation.

9. Be diligent to come unto me quickly,

10. for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,

11. Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with yourself, for he is profitable to me for ministration 

12. and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;

13. the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring you and the books -- especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil harm; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,

15. of whom also do you beware, for greatly has he stood against our words;

16. in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)

17. and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,

18. and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save me -- to his heavenly kingdom; to whom is the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen.

19. Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus' household;

20. Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus sick;

21. be diligent to come before winter. Salute you does Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

22. The Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit; the grace is with you! Amen.
