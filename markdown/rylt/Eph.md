# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1. Paul, an apostle 

2. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!

3. Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us in every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,

4. according as He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, for our being holy and unblemished before Him, in love,

5. having foreordained 

6. to the praise of the glory of His grace, in which He made us accepted in the beloved 

7. in whom we have the redemption 

8. in which He did abound 

9. having made known to us the secret of His will, according to His good pleasure, that He purposed in Himself,

10. in regard to the dispensation 

11. in whom also we did obtain an inheritance, being foreordained 

12. for our being to the praise of His glory, even those who did first hope in the Christ,

13. in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth -- the good news of your salvation -- in whom also having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,

14. which is an earnest 

15. Because of this I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love to all the saints,

16. do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,

17. that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the recognition 

18. the eyes of your understanding 

19. and what the exceeding greatness 

20. which He wrought 

21. far above all principality, and authority, and might, and lordship, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in the coming one;

22. and all things He did put under his feet, and did give him -- head over all things to the assembly,

23. which is his body, the fulness of Him who is filling the all in all,

## Ephesians 2

1. Also you -- being dead in the trespasses and the sins,

2. in which once you did walk according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience,

3. among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our flesh, doing the wishes 

4. and God, being rich in kindness, because of His great love with which He loved us,

5. even being dead in the trespasses, made us to live together with the Christ, (by grace you are having been saved,)

6. and raised us up together, and did seat us together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

7. that He might show, in the ages that are coming, the exceeding 

8. for by grace you are having been saved, through faith, and this not of you -- of God the gift,

9. not of works, that no one may boast;

10. for of Him we are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God did before prepare, that in them we may walk.

11. Therefore, remember, that you were once the nations in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that called Circumcision in the flesh made by hands,

12. that you were at that time apart from Christ, having been alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God, in the world;

13. and now, in Christ Jesus, you being once afar off became near in the blood of the Christ,

14. for he is our peace, who did make both one, and the middle wall of the enclosure did break down,

15. the enmity 

16. and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity 

17. and having come, he did proclaim good news -- peace to you -- the far-off and the near,

18. because through him we have the access -- we both -- in one Spirit unto the Father.

19. Then, therefore, you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,

20. being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being chief corner-stone,

21. in whom all the building fitly framed together does increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord,

22. in whom also you are builded together, for a habitation 

## Ephesians 3

1. For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations,

2. if, indeed, you did hear of the dispensation 

3. that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few words --

4. in regard to which you are able, reading it, to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ,

5. which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit --

6. that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news,

7. of which I became a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power;

8. to me -- the less than the least of all the saints -- was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news -- the untraceable riches of the Christ,

9. and to cause all to see what is the fellowship 

10. that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly places, through the assembly, the manifold 

11. according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,

12. in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him,

13. wherefore, I ask you not to faint in my tribulations 

14. For this cause I bow 

15. of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named,

16. that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might 

17. that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded,

18. that you may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,

19. to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding 

20. and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly 

21. to Him is the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen.

## Ephesians 4

1. Call upon you, then, do I -- the prisoner of the Lord -- to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,

2. with all lowliness 

3. being diligent 

4. one body and one Spirit, according as also you were called in one hope of your calling;

5. one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

6. one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in you 

7. and to each one of you was given the grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ,

8. wherefore, he says, 'Having gone up on high he led captive captivity, and gave gifts to men,' --

9. and that, he went up, what is it except that he also went down first to the lower parts of the earth?

10. he who went down is the same also who went up far above all the heavens, that He may fill all things --

11. and He gave some as apostles 

12. unto the perfecting 

13. till we may all come to the unity of the faith and of the recognition 

14. that we may no more be babes 

15. and, being true in love, we may increase to Him in all things, who is the head -- the Christ;

16. from whom the whole body, being fitly joined together and united, through the supply of every joint, according to the working in the measure of each single part, the increase of the body does make for the building up of itself in love.

17. This, then, I say, and I testify in the Lord; you are no more to walk, as also the other nations walk, in the vanity of their mind,

18. being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,

19. who, having ceased to feel, themselves did give up to the lasciviousness 

20. and you did not so 

21. if so be you did hear him, and in him were taught, as truth is in Jesus;

22. you are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old man 

23. and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,

24. and to put on the new man, which, according to God, was created in righteousness and kindness of the truth.

25. Wherefore, putting away the lying, speak truth each with his neighbour, because we are members one of another;

26. be angry and do not sin; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,

27. neither give place to the devil;

28. whosoever is stealing let him no more steal, but rather let him labour, working the thing that is good with the hands, that he may have to impart 

29. Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth, but what is good unto the needful building up, that it may give grace to the hearers;

30. and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God, in which you were sealed to a day of redemption.

31. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour 

32. and become one to another kind, tender-hearted 

## Ephesians 5

1. Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved,

2. and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour 

3. and whoredom 

4. also filthiness 

5. for this you know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God.

6. Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things comes the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,

7. become not, then, partakers 

8. for you were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as children of light walk you,

9. for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth,

10. proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,

11. and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict 

12. for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of,

13. and all the things reproved 

14. wherefore he says, 'Arouse yourself, you who are sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon you.'

15. See, then, how exactly you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,

16. redeeming the time, because the days are evil;

17. because of this become not fools, but -- understanding what is the will of the Lord,

18. and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness 

19. speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,

20. giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father;

21. subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.

22. The wives! to your own husbands subject 

23. because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ is head of the assembly, and he is saviour of the body,

24. but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also are the wives to their own husbands in everything.

25. The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did love the assembly, and did give himself for it,

26. that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it with the bathing of the water in the saying,

27. that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished;

28. so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife -- himself he does love;

29. for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but does nourish and cherish it, as also the Lord -- the assembly,

30. because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones;

31. 'for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh;'

32. this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly;

33. but you also, every one in particular -- let each his own wife so love as himself, and the wife -- that she may reverence the husband.

## Ephesians 6

1. The children! obey your parents in the Lord, for this is righteous;

2. honour your father and mother,

3. which is the first command with a promise, 'That it may be well with you, and you may live a long time upon the land.'

4. And the fathers! provoke not your children, but nourish them in the instruction and admonition 

5. The servants! obey the masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to the Christ;

6. not with eye-service as men-pleasers 

7. with good-will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men 

8. having known that whatever good thing each one may do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether servant or freeman 

9. And the masters! the same things do you unto them, letting threatening alone, having known that also your Master is in the heavens, and acceptance of persons 

10. As to the rest, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;

11. put on the whole armour of God, for your being able to stand against the wiles 

12. because we have not the wrestling with blood and flesh, but with the principalities, with the authorities, with the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, with the spiritual things of the evil in the heavenly places;

13. because of this take you up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the day of the evil, and all things having done -- to stand.

14. Stand, therefore, having your loins girt 

15. and having the feet shod in the preparation of the good-news of the peace;

16. above all, having taken up the shield of the faith, in which ye shall be able all the fiery darts of the evil one to quench,

17. and the helmet of the salvation receive, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the saying of God,

18. through all prayer and supplication 

19. and in behalf of me, that to me may be given a word in the opening of my mouth, in freedom, to make known the secret of the good news,

20. for which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I may speak freely -- as it behooves 

21. And that you may know -- you also -- the things concerning me -- what I do, all things make known to you shall Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord,

22. whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that you might know the things concerning us, and that he might comfort your hearts.

23. Peace to the brethren, and love, with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!

24. The grace with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ -- undecayingly! Amen.
