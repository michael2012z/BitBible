# Galatians

## Galatians 1

1. Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead),

2. and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Galatia:

3. Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ

4. who gave himself for our sins, so that he might rescue us, according to the will of our God and Father, out of the evil age that has come,

5. to whom is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.

6. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him who called you in the grace of Christ to another good-news,

7. which is not another, except there are some who confuse you, and who want to pervert the good-news of the Christ.

8. But even if we, or an agent from heaven, should preach a good-news to you contrary to what we preached to you, let him be accursed.

9. As we have said before, I now also say again, if any man preaches a good-news to you contrary to what ye received, let him be accursed.

10. For do I now trust men or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I were still pleasing men I would not be a bondman of Christ.

11. For I make known to you, brothers, the good-news that was preached by me, that it is not according to man.

12. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through revelation of Jesus Christ.

13. For ye heard of my former behavior in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God to extraordinariness, and ravaged it.

14. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my race, being a more extreme zealot of my paternal traditions.

15. But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's belly, and called me through his grace,

16. to reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not straightaway confer with flesh and blood,

17. nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.

18. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days.

19. But I did not see another of the apostles except James the Lord's brother.

20. Now what I write to you, behold before God, I do not lie.

21. Later I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

22. And I was unknown by face to the congregations of Judea in Christ,

23. but they were only hearing that the man who once persecuted us now preaches the good-news, the faith that he once ravaged.

24. And they glorified God in me.

## Galatians 2

1. Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken along Titus also.

2. And I went up according to revelation, and I declared to them the good-news that I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of repute, lest somehow I might be running or ran in vain.

3. But not even Titus with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.

4. But that issue was because of those FALSE brothers smuggled in, who sneaked in to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us,

5. to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, so that the truth of the good-news might continue with you.

6. But from those who were reputed to be something (what kind they were formerly, it makes no difference to me, God does not accept a personage of man), for those who were of repute added nothing to me,

7. but to the contrary, when they saw that I was entrusted with the good-news for men of uncircumcision, as Peter for men of circumcision

8. (for he who was working in Peter for the apostleship for men of circumcision was also working in me for the Gentiles),

9. and James and Cephas and John, those who were reputed to be pillars, when they understood the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship. So that we were for the Gentiles, and they for me

10. only that we should remember the poor, which this same thing I also was eager to do.

11. But when Peter came to Antioch I opposed him to the face, because he was blameworthy.

12. For before certain men came from James he ate together with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing men of circumcision.

13. And the other Jews also joined in hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas went along with their hypocrisy.

14. But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly toward the truth of the good-news, I said to Peter before all, If thou being a Jew, live as a Gentile and not as a Jew, why do thou compel the Gentiles to live as Jews?

15. We are Jews by nature and not sinful men of the Gentiles,

16. knowing that a man is not made righteous from works of law, instead through faith of Jesus Christ. And we believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made righteous from faith of Christ, and not from works of law, because no fles

17. But if, while seeking to be made righteous in Christ, we ourselves were also found sinful, then is Christ an aide of sin? May it not happen!

18. For if I build again these things that I torn down, I demonstrate myself a transgressor.

19. For I, through law, died to law, so that I might live to God.

20. I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. And what I now live in flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me.

21. I do not disregard the grace of God, for if righteousness is through law, then Christ died in vain.

## Galatians 3

1. O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was earlier described among you, crucified?

2. I only want to learn this from you. Did ye receive the Spirit from works of law, or from a listening ear of faith?

3. Are ye so foolish, having begun in Spirit, are ye now made perfect by flesh?

4. Did ye suffer so many things in vain? If it is indeed in vain.

5. He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and who works miracles among you, is it from works of law or from a listening ear of faith?

6. Just as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.

7. Ye know therefore that those from faith, these are sons of Abraham.

8. And the scripture having foreseen that God makes the Gentiles righteous from faith, proclaimed the good-news in advance to Abraham: In thee all the nations will be blessed.

9. So then those from faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.

10. For as many as are from works of law are under a curse, for it is written, Cursed is every man who does not continue in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.

11. But that no man is made righteous by law before God, is evident, because, The righteous man will live from faith.

12. And the law is not from faith, but the man who does them will live in them.

13. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, Cursed is every man who hangs on a tree.

14. So that the blessing of Abraham might occur for the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith.

15. Brothers (I speak according to a man), in the same way of a man, no man annuls or adds to a contract that has been ratified.

16. Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, And to the seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, who is Christ.

17. And I say this, a covenant previously confirmed by God in Christ, the law, which happened four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul in order to make the promise useless.

18. For if the inheritance is from law, it is no longer from promise. But God has given it to Abraham through promise.

19. Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the seed would come to whom it was promised, which was arranged through heavenly agents in the hand of a mediator.

20. Now a mediator is not of one, but God is one.

21. Is the law therefore against the promises of God? May it not happen! For if a law was given that could make alive, truly righteousness would be from law.

22. But scripture confined all things under sin, so that the promise from faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

23. But before faith came we were kept in custody under law, having been confined for faith that was going to be revealed.

24. So that the law became our schoolmaster for Christ, so that we might be made righteous from faith.

25. But faith having come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

26. For ye are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.

27. For as many as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.

28. There is no Jew nor Greek, there is no bondman nor freeman, there is no male and female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

29. And if ye are Christ's, then ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.

## Galatians 4

1. But I say the heir, for as long a time as he is a child, differs nothing from a bondman though he is lord of all.

2. Instead he is under stewards and managers until the time appointed from the father.

3. And so when we were children, we were in bondage under the rudiments of the world.

4. But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born from a woman, born under law,

5. so that he might redeem those under law, so that we might receive the sonship.

6. And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

7. So that thou are no longer a bondman but a son, and if a son, then an heir through Christ.

8. But of course not knowing God then, ye were in bondage to those in nature who are not gods,

9. but now knowing God, but rather being known by God, how is it ye turn again to the weak and destitute elements to which ye desire again to be in bondage anew?

10. Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

11. I am afraid of you, lest somehow I have labored toward you in vain.

12. I beseech you, brothers, become like me, because I also am like ye. Ye wronged me in nothing.

13. But ye know that through a weakness of the flesh I preached the good-news to you the first time.

14. And ye did not disdain, nor did ye reject my trial in my flesh, but ye received me as an agent of God, as Christ Jesus.

15. Where then is your satisfaction? For I testify to you, that if possible, having plucked your eyes out, ye would have given them to me.

16. So then have I become your enemy telling you the truth?

17. They are zealous for you but not honorably. They want to exclude you, so that ye may be zealous for them.

18. But to be zealous of is always good in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.

19. My little children, of whom I suffer birth pains again until Christ is formed in you.

20. But I was wishing to be present with you now and to change my tone, because I am perplexed at you.

21. Tell me those desiring to be under law, do ye not hear the law?

22. For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one from the servant girl, and one from the freewoman.

23. But in fact, the man from the servant girl was born according to flesh, but the man from the freewoman through promise.

24. Which things are allegorized, for these are two covenants, indeed one from mount Sinai giving birth for bondage, which is Hagar.

25. For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and it corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children.

26. But the Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.

27. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren woman not giving birth. Burst forth and shout, thou not suffering birth pains, because many more are the children of the desolate than of her who has the husband.

28. Now we, brothers, who correspond to Isaac, are children of promise.

29. But just as then, the man who was born according to flesh persecuted the man according to Spirit, so also now.

30. Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? Send away the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will, no, not inherit with the son of the freewoman.

31. So then, brothers, we are not children of a servant girl, but of the freewoman.

## Galatians 5

1. Stand firm therefore in the liberty in which Christ freed us, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.

2. Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ will benefit you nothing.

3. And I solemnly declare again to every man who is circumcised, that he is obligated to do the whole law.

4. Ye were discharged from the Christ, ye who are made righteous by law. Ye have fallen from grace.

5. For we, in a Spirit of faith, wait for a hope of righteousness.

6. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.

7. Ye were running well. Who hindered you, not to obey the truth?

8. This persuasion is not from him who calls you.

9. A little leaven leavens the whole lump.

10. I have confidence toward you in Lord, that ye will think no other thing. But the man who troubles you will bear the verdict, whoever he may be.

11. But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the cross has been abolished.

12. O that those who trouble you would even cut it all off.

13. For ye, brothers, were called to liberty, only not liberty for an opportunity to the flesh, but be servants to each other through love.

14. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.

15. But if ye bite and devour each other, watch out that ye be not consumed by each other.

16. But I say, walk in Spirit and ye will, no, not fulfill a lust of flesh.

17. For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit is against the flesh. For these are hostile to each other, so that whatever these things are ye may want, ye may not do.

18. But if ye are led by Spirit ye are not under law.

19. Now the works of the flesh are apparent, which are, adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,

20. idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strifes, jealousies, wraths, selfish ambitions, dissentions, factions,

21. envyings, murders, intoxications, revelings, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, as I also did forewarn, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

23. gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.

24. And those of the Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and the lusts.

25. If we live in Spirit, we should also march in Spirit.

26. Let us not become conceited, provoking each other, envying each other.

## Galatians 6

1. And brothers, if a man is overtaken in some transgression, ye the spiritual, restore such in a spirit of meekness, looking to thyself lest thou also be tempted.

2. Bear the burdens of each other, and so fulfill the law of the Christ.

3. For if some man presumes to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

4. But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have the boast in himself alone and not in the other man.

5. For each man will bear his own burden.

6. But let him who is taught in the word share in all good things with him who teaches.

7. Be not misled, God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows this he will also reap.

8. Because he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.

9. And let us not be weary doing good, for in our own time we will reap, not desponding.

10. So then as we have time, let us work what is good toward all men, and especially toward those belonging to a household of the faith.

11. See in how large letters I wrote to you with my hand.

12. As many as desire to make a good impression in flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of the Christ.

13. For not even those who have been circumcised themselves keep law, but they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast in thy flesh.

14. But may it not be from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.

16. And as many as will march by this standard, peace upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

17. Finally, let no man cause troubles for me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit, brothers. Truly.
