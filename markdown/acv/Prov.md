## Proverbs 1

1. The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel,

2. to know wisdom and instruction, to discern the words of understanding,

3. to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness and justice and equity,

4. to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion,

5. that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, and that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsels,

6. to understand a proverb, and a figure, the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

7. The fear of LORD is the beginning of knowledge. The foolish despise wisdom and instruction.

8. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.

9. For they shall be a garland of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck.

10. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

11. If they say, Come with us. Let us lay wait for blood. Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.

12. Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the pit.

13. We shall find all precious substance. We shall fill our houses with spoil.

14. Thou shall cast thy lot among us. We will all have one bag.

15. My son, walk not thou in the way with them. Restrain thy foot from their path.

16. For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.

17. For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,

18. and these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.

19. So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain. It takes away the life of the owners of it.

20. Wisdom cries aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the broad places.

21. She cries in the chief place of concourse, at the entrance of the gates, in the city. She utters her words:

22. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn back at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you. I will make my words known to you.

24. Because I have called, and ye have refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man has regarded,

25. but ye have made all my counsel void, and want none of my reproof,

26. I also will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear comes,

27. when your fear comes as a storm, and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.

28. Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me,

29. because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of LORD.

30. They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.

31. Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

32. For the backsliding of the simple shall kill them, and the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.

33. But he who hearkens to me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if thou will receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee,

2. so as to incline thine ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding,

3. yea, if thou cry after discernment, and lift up thy voice for understanding,

4. if thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,

5. then thou shall understand the fear of LORD, and find the knowledge of God.

6. For LORD gives wisdom. Out of his mouth [is] knowledge and understanding.

7. He lays up sound wisdom for the upright, a shield to those who walk in integrity,

8. that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his sanctified.

9. Then thou shall understand righteousness and justice and equity, [yea], every good path.

10. For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to thy soul,

11. discretion shall watch over thee, understanding shall keep thee,

12. to deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things,

13. who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,

14. who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil,

15. who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths,

16. to deliver thee from the interloping woman, even from the stranger who flatters with her words,

17. who forsakes the companion of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God

18. (for her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead;

19. none who go to her return again, nor do they attain to the paths of life),

20. that thou may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.

21. For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

22. But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, do not forget my law, but let thy heart keep my commandments.

2. For length of days, and years of life, and peace, they will add to thee.

3. Let not kindness and truth forsake thee. Bind them about thy neck, write them upon the tablet of thy heart,

4. so thou shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

5. Trust in LORD with all thy heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding.

6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths.

7. Be not wise in thine own eyes. Fear LORD, and depart from evil.

8. It will be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

9. Honor LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase,

10. so thy barns shall be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.

11. My son, despise not the chastening of LORD, nor be weary of his reproof.

12. For whom LORD loves he reproves, and he whips every son whom he receives (LXX/NT).

13. Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding.

14. For the gain of it is better than the gain of silver, and the profit of it than fine gold.

15. She is more precious than rubies, and none of the things thou can desire are to be compared to her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand, in her left hand are riches and honor.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

18. She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her. And happy is everyone who retains her.

19. LORD by wisdom founded the earth. By understanding he established the heavens.

20. By his knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.

21. My son, let them not depart from thine eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion,

22. so they shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

23. Then thou shall walk in thy way securely, and thy foot shall not stumble.

24. When thou lay down, thou shall not be afraid. Yea, thou shall lay down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

25. Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.

26. For LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being taken.

27. Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.

28. Do not say to thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give, when thou have it by thee.

29. Do not devise evil against thy neighbor, since he dwells securely by thee.

30. Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done thee no harm.

31. Do not envy thou the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.

32. For the perverse man is an abomination to LORD, but his friendship is with the upright.

33. The curse of LORD is in the house of a wicked man, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.

34. Surely the Lord is opposed to the arrogant (LXX/NT), but he gives grace to the lowly.

35. The wise shall inherit glory, but shame shall be the promotion of fools.

## Proverbs 4

1. Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.

2. For I give you good doctrine. Forsake ye not my law.

3. For I was a son to my father, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.

4. And he taught me, and said to me, Let thy heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live.

5. Get wisdom, get understanding. Do not forget, nor decline from the words of my mouth.

6. Do not forsake her, and she will preserve thee. Love her, and she will keep thee.

7. Wisdom [is] the principal thing. Get wisdom, yea, with all thy getting get understanding.

8. Exalt her, and she will promote thee. She will bring thee to honor when thou embrace her.

9. She will give to thy head a garland of grace, a crown of beauty she will deliver to thee.

10. Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be many.

11. I have taught thee in the way of wisdom. I have led thee in paths of uprightness.

12. When thou go, thy steps shall not be restricted. And if thou run, thou shall not stumble.

13. Take firm hold of instruction. Do not let her go. Keep her, for she is thy life.

14. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.

15. Avoid it. Do not pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.

16. For they do not sleep unless they do evil. And their sleep is taken away unless they cause to fall.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

18. But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.

19. The way of the wicked is as darkness. They know not at what they stumble.

20. My son, attend to my words. Incline thine ear to my sayings.

21. Let them not depart from thine eyes. Keep them in the midst of thy heart.

22. For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.

23. Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.

24. Put away from thee a wayward mouth, and put perverse lips far from thee.

25. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.

26. Make the path of thy feet level, and let all thy ways be established.

27. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left. Remove thy foot from evil.

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, attend to my wisdom. Incline thine ear to my understanding,

2. that thou may preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.

3. For the lips of an interloping woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.

4. But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

5. Her feet go down to death. Her steps take hold on Sheol,

6. so that she does not find the level path of life. Her ways are unstable, [and] she does not know.

7. Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.

8. Remove thy way far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,

9. lest thou give thine honor to others, and thy years to the cruel,

10. lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labors [be] in the house of an alien,

11. and thou mourn at thy latter end when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

12. and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof.

13. Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!

14. I was almost in all evil in the midst of the assembly and congregation.

15. Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.

16. Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, and streams of water in the streets?

17. Let them be for thyself alone, and not for strangers with thee.

18. Let thy fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of thy youth:

19. a loving hind and a pleasant doe. Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, and be thou ravished always with her love.

20. For why should thou, my son, be ravished with an interloping woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of LORD, and he makes level all his paths.

22. His own iniquities shall take a wicked man, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.

23. He shall die for lack of instruction. And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if thou have become surety for thy neighbor, if thou have struck thy hands for a stranger,

2. thou are snared with the words of thy mouth, thou are taken with the words of thy mouth.

3. Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, since thou have come into the hand of thy neighbor. Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor.

4. Do not give sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

5. Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, thou sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise.

7. Which, having no chief, overseer, or ruler,

8. provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.

9. How long will thou sleep, O sluggard? When will thou arise out of thy sleep?

10. A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,

11. so thy poverty shall come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man.

12. A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth,

13. who winks with his eyes, who speaks with his feet, who makes signs with his fingers,

14. in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who sows discord.

15. Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly. Suddenly he shall be broken, and that without remedy.

16. There are six things which LORD hates, yea, seven which are an abomination to him:

17. haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

18. a heart that devises wicked purposes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,

19. a FALSE witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.

20. My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and do not forsake the law of thy mother.

21. Bind them continually upon thy heart. Tie them about thy neck.

22. When thou walk, it shall lead thee. When thou sleep, it shall watch over thee. And when thou awake, it shall talk with thee.

23. For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,

24. to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the stranger's tongue.

25. Do not lust after her beauty in thy heart, nor let her take thee with her eyelids.

26. For the price of a harlot is as much as a piece of bread, but the adulteress hunts for the precious life.

27. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

28. Or can a man walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?

29. So [is] he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her shall not be unpunished.

30. Men do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry.

31. Yet if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold. He shall give all the substance of his house.

32. He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who would destroy his own soul does it.

33. Wounds and dishonor he shall get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

34. For jealousy is a man's fury, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

35. He will not regard any ransom, nor will he be satisfied, though thou give many gifts.

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

2. Keep my commandments and live, and my law as the apple of thine eye.

3. Bind them upon thy fingers. Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.

4. Say to wisdom, Thou are my sister, and call understanding [thy] kinswoman,

5. that they may keep thee from the interloping woman, from the stranger who flatters with her words.

6. For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice,

7. and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding

8. passing through the street near her corner. And he went the way to her house,

9. in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness.

10. And, behold, there met him a woman attired like a harlot, and wily of heart.

11. She is loud and headstrong. Her feet abide not in her house.

12. Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lays in wait at every corner.

13. So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him,

14. Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me. I have paid my vows this day.

15. Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.

16. I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.

17. I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning. Let us solace ourselves with love.

19. For the man is not at home. He has gone a long journey.

20. He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.

21. With her much fair speech she causes him to yield. With the flattering of her lips she forces him along.

22. He goes after her straightaway, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,

23. till an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare. And he does not know that it is for his life.

24. Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.

25. Let not thy heart decline to her ways. Go not astray in her paths.

26. For she has cast down many wounded. Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.

27. Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.

## Proverbs 8

1. Does not wisdom cry out, and understanding put forth her voice?

2. On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she stands.

3. Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she cries aloud:

4. To you, O men, I call. And my voice is to the sons of men.

5. O ye simple, understand prudence, and, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.

6. Hear, for I will speak excellent things. And the opening of my lips shall be right things.

7. For my mouth shall utter truth. And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

8. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.

9. They are all plain to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.

10. Receive my instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.

11. For wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.

12. I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling, and find out knowledge [and] discretion.

13. The fear of LORD is to hate evil. Pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate.

14. Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge. I am understanding, I have might.

15. By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice.

16. By me rulers rule, and ranking men, [even] all the judges of the earth.

17. I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently shall find me.

18. Riches and honor are with me, durable wealth and righteousness.

19. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold, and my revenue than choice silver.

20. I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice,

21. that I may cause those who love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.

22. LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.

23. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth was,

24. when there were no depths. I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water,

25. before the mountains were settled, before the hills. I was brought forth

26. while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.

27. When he established the heavens, I was there. When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,

28. when he made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong,

29. when he gave to the sea its bound that the waters should not transgress his commandment, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,

30. then I was by him, a master workman. And I was daily [his] delight, rejoicing always before him,

31. rejoicing in his habitable earth. And my delight was with the sons of men.

32. Now therefore, ye sons, hearken to me. For blessed are those who keep my ways.

33. Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not refuse it.

34. Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

35. For he who finds me finds life, and shall obtain favor of LORD.

36. But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. All those who hate me love death.

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom has built her house. She has hewn out her seven pillars.

2. She has killed her beasts. She has mingled her wine. She has also furnished her table.

3. She has sent forth her maidens. She cries out upon the highest places of the city:

4. He who is simple, let him turn in here. As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,

5. Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

6. Forsake ye simpleness, and live, and walk in the way of understanding.

7. He who corrects a scoffer gets himself reviling. And he who reproves a wicked man [gets] himself a bruise.

9. Give opportunity to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser. Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.

10. The fear of LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding.

11. For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

12. If thou are wise, thou are wise for thyself. And if thou scoff, thou alone shall bear it.

13. The foolish woman is clamorous, simple, and knows nothing.

14. And she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

15. to call to those who pass by, who go right on their ways:

16. He who is simple, let him turn in here. And as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,

17. Stolen waters are sweet, and bread in secret is pleasant.
