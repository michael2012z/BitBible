# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ:

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We are indebted to thank God always about you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith is increasing greatly, and the love of each one of you all toward each other abounds.

4. So as for us ourselves to have pride in you in the congregations of God, for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the tribulations that ye endure,

5. being evidence of the righteous judgment of God, for you to be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also ye suffer.

6. Since it is a righteous thing according to God to repay restriction to those who restrict you,

7. and relief with us, to you who are restricted, at the revealing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his agents of power

8. in a fire of flame rendering vengeance to those who have not known God, and to those not obeying the good-news of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. Men who will suffer punishment, a penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,

10. when he comes to be glorified in his sanctified, and to be marveled in that day by all those who believe (because our testimony among you was believed).

11. For which also we pray always about you, so that our God will make you worthy of the calling, and will fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith with power.

12. So that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. Now we ask you, brothers, on behalf of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him,

2. for ye not to be quickly shaken from your mind, nor to be alarmed, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by a letter as by us, as that the day of the Christ has come.

3. Let not any man deceive you in any way, because if not, the defection may come first, and he may be revealed--the man of sin, the son of destruction,

4. who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or an object of worship, so as for him to sit in the temple of God, as God, displaying himself that he is God.

5. Do ye not remember that when I was yet with you I told you these things?

6. And now ye know that which restrains, for him to be revealed in his own time.

7. For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only he who restrains it until now will develop from the midst.

8. And then the lawless will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the spirit of his mouth, and will neutralize at the appearance of his coming.

9. Whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and marvels of deceit,

10. and in all deception of unrighteousness in those who are perishing, in return for which, they did not accept the love of the truth in order for them to be saved.

11. And because of this God will send them the force of a delusion, for them to believe a lie,

12. so that they might be condemned--all those who did not believe the truth, but who delighted in unrighteousness.

13. But we are indebted to express thanks to God always about you, brothers, beloved by Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation, in sanctification of spirit and belief of truth,

14. for which he called you, through our good-news, for an acquired possession of glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that ye were taught, whether by word or by letter from us.

16. And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father who loved us and gave eternal encouragement and good hope through grace,

17. encourage your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Finally, brothers, pray about us, so that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, just as also with you,

2. and that we may be delivered from aberrant and wicked men, for the faith is not of all men.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and will keep you from evil.

4. And we are persuaded in Lord toward you, that what we command you, ye both are doing and will do.

5. And may the Lord direct your hearts for the love of God, and for the steadfastness of the Christ.

6. Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition, which they received from us.

7. For ye yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us. Because we did not act disorderly among you,

8. nor did we eat bread gratis from any man, but in labor and toil, working night and day in order not to burden any of you.

9. Not because we have no right, but that we might give ourselves an example to you, in order to imitate us.

10. For even when we were with you we commanded you this, that if any man will not work, neither let him eat.

11. For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but being busybodies.

12. Now to such men we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with quietness, they should eat their own bread.

13. But ye, brothers, do not become weary doing good.

14. And if any man does not obey our word by this letter, note that man, and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.

15. And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

16. Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace through everything in every way. The Lord is with all of you.

17. The salutation of Paul by my hand, which is a mark in every letter I write this way.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with all of you. Truly.
