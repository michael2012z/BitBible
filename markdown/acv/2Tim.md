# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life in Christ Jesus,

2. to Timothy, a beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. I have gratitude to God whom I serve from the forefathers in a pure conscience, as I have unceasing remembrance about thee in my supplications, night and day

4. longing to see thee, having remembered thy tears, so that I may be filled with joy,

5. taking memory of the non-hypocritical faith in thee, which first dwelt in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that is in thee also.

6. Because of which reason I remind thee to rekindle the gift of God that is in thee through the laying on of my hands.

7. For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of soberness.

8. Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner, but suffer together with the good-news according to the power of God.

9. Who saved us and who called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal.

10. But which has now been manifested by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who indeed abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the good-news,

11. for which I was appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of Gentiles.

12. Because of which reason I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to preserve my consignment for that day.

13. Hold the pattern of sound words that thou heard from me, in faith and love in Christ Jesus.

14. Guard the good consignment through the Holy Spirit that dwells in us.

15. This thou know, that all those in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16. May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.

17. But when he happened to be in Rome he sought me more diligently and found me

18. (may the Lord grant him to find mercy from Lord in that day), and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou know very well.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace in Christ Jesus.

2. And what thou have heard from me through many witnesses, these things commit thou to faithful men who will be competent to teach others also.

3. Thou therefore endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

4. No man who serves in the military entangles himself in the affairs of life, so that he may please the man who enlisted the army.

5. And also if any man competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.

6. The farmer who labors must be the first to partake of the fruits.

7. Consider what I say, for may the Lord give thee understanding in all things.

8. Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good-news,

9. within which I suffer evil to the point of bonds as an evildoer, but the word of God is not bound.

10. Because of this I endure all things because of the chosen, so that they also may experience salvation in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.

11. Faithful is the saying, For if we die together, we will also live together.

12. If we endure, we will also reign together. If we renounce him, that man will also renounce us.

13. If we are unfaithful, that man remains faithful. He cannot renounce himself.

14. Remind them of these things, solemnly testifying in the sight of the Lord, not to brawl verbally, to nothing useful, to the ruin of those who hear.

15. Be diligent to present thyself approved to God, an irreproachable workman, correctly traversing the word of truth.

16. But shun profane babblings, for they will advance to greater impiety,

17. and their word will have a feeding field like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,

18. men who missed the mark about the truth, saying the resurrection happened already, and they overthrow the faith of some.

19. Nevertheless the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, Lord knows those who are his, and, Let every man who names the name of Lord keep away from unrighteousness.

20. Now in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and earthen, and some for esteem and some for disesteem.

21. If therefore any man purges himself from these things, he will be a vessel for esteem, sanctified and useful to the master, prepared for every good work.

22. And flee juvenile impulses, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.

23. But shun foolish and uneducated questions, knowing that they breed quarrels.

24. And a bondman of Lord must not quarrel, but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,

25. in mildness correcting those who oppose. Perhaps God may grant them repentance for recognition of the truth,

26. and they may sober up out of the snare of the devil, having been captured by him for his will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come.

2. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, impious,

3. devoid of natural affection, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, savage, no lovers of good,

4. traitors, reckless, beclouded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

5. having a form of piety, but repudiating the power of it. Now turn away from these men,

6. for from these are those who creep into houses, and take captive petty women laden with sins, being led away by various impulses,

7. ever learning and never able to come to knowledge of truth.

8. And by which way Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also do these oppose the truth. Men corrupted in mind, worthless about the faith.

9. But they will not advance in much more, for their folly will be evident to all men, as also that of those men came to be.

10. But thou have closely followed my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,

11. persecutions, sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and the Lord rescued me out of them all.

12. And also all those who want to live devoutly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

13. But evil men and impostors will go forward to worse, leading astray and being led astray.

14. But continue thou in what thou learned and were convinced of, knowing from whom thou learned them.

15. And that from a babe thou have known the sacred writings, which are able to make thee wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

16. Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for instruction, for reproof, for correction, for discipline in righteousness,

17. so that the man of God may be qualified, having been completed for every good work.

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I solemnly testify therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is going to judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom,

2. preach the word, stand ready in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.

3. For there will be time when they will not tolerate sound doctrine, but they will accumulate teachers to themselves according to their own desires, who tickle the ear,

4. and will indeed turn the ear away from the truth, and will be turned aside to myths.

5. But be thou sober in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, bring thy ministry to fullness.

6. For I am already poured out a libation, and the time of my dissolution is imminent.

7. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.

8. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me in that day, and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.

9. Hurry to come to me quickly,

10. for Demas forsook me having loved the present age, and he went to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

11. Only Luke is with me. Having taken Mark, bring him with thee, for he is useful to me for service.

12. But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.

13. Bring the cloak that I left behind at Troas with Carpus when thou come, and the books, especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me. May the Lord repay him according to his works,

15. of whom thou also beware, for he extremely opposed our words.

16. At my first defense no man came with me, but all forsook me. May it not be reckoned to them.

17. But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the sacred message might be brought to fullness, and all the Gentiles might hear. And I was rescued out of the mouth of the lion.

18. And the Lord will rescue me from every evil work, and will save me for his heavenly kingdom, to whom is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.

19. Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left being sick at Miletus.

21. Hurry to come before winter. Eubulus salutes thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.

22. The Lord Jesus Christ is with thy spirit. Grace is with you. Truly.
