30. And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his so

31. And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

32. And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread ye shall burn with fire.

33. And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled, for he shall consecrate you seven days.

34. As has been done this day, so LORD has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.

35. And ye shall remain at the door of the tent of meeting day and night seven days, and keep the charge of LORD, that ye not die, for so I am commanded.

36. And Aaron and his sons did all the things which LORD commanded by Moses.

## Leviticus 9

1. And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel,

2. and he said to Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before LORD.

3. And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering,

4. and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before LORD, and a meal-offering mingled with oil. For today LORD appears to you.

5. And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before LORD.

6. And Moses said, This is the thing which LORD commanded that ye should do, and the glory of LORD shall appear to you.

7. And Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people. And offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them, as LORD com

8. So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.

9. And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar,

10. but he burnt the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, upon the altar, as LORD commanded Moses.

11. And he burnt the flesh and the skin with fire outside the camp.

12. And he killed the burnt-offering. And Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.

13. And they delivered the burnt-offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burnt them upon the altar.

14. And he washed the innards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.

15. And he presented the people's oblation. And took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, as the first.

16. And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.

17. And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand from it, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.

18. He also killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people. And Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,

19. and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers [the innards], and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver.

20. And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar.

21. And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before LORD, as Moses commanded.

22. And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them. And he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.

23. And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people. And the glory of LORD appeared to all the people.

24. And there came forth fire from before LORD, and consumed the burnt-offering and the fat upon the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

## Leviticus 10

1. And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each of them took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before LORD, which he had not commanded them.

2. And there came forth fire from before LORD, and devoured them, and they died before LORD.

3. Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in those who come near me. And I will be glorified before all the people. And Aaron remained silent.

4. And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Draw near. Carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

5. So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.

6. And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear your clothes, that ye not die, and that he not be angry with all the congregation, but let your brothers, the w

7. And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

8. And LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,

9. Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye not die--it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations--

10. and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,

11. and that ye may teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which LORD has spoken to them by Moses.

12. And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the meal-offering that remains of the offerings of LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar, for it is most holy.

13. And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons' portion, of the offerings of LORD made by fire. For so I am commanded.

14. And ye shall eat the wave-breast and the heave-thigh in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. For they are given as thy portion, and thy sons' portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the s

15. They shall bring the heave-thigh and the wave-breast with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before LORD, and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, as a portion forever, as LORD has commande

16. And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt. And he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,

17. Why have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before LORD?

18. Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary inside. Ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.

19. And Aaron spoke to Moses, Behold, this day they have offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before LORD, and there have befallen me such things as these. And if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been we

20. And when Moses heard, it was well-pleasing in his sight.

## Leviticus 11

1. And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

3. Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven footed, [and] chews the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.

4. Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those that part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but does not part the hoof, he is unclean to you.

5. And the coney, because he chews the cud but does not part the hoof, he is unclean to you.

6. And the hare, because she chews the cud but does not part the hoof, she is unclean to you.

7. And the swine, because he parts the hoof, and is cloven footed, but does not chew the cud, he is unclean to you.

8. Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch, they are unclean to you.

9. These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat.

10. And all that have no fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you,

11. and they shall be an abomination to you. Ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.

12. Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination to you.

13. And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds, they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,

14. and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,

15. every raven after its kind,

16. and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-gull, and the hawk after its kind,

17. and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

18. and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,

19. and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.

20. All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination to you.

21. Yet these ye may eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to leap upon the earth,

22. even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.

23. But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination to you,

24. and by these ye shall become unclean. Whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening.

25. And whoever bears [any] of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.

26. Every beast which parts the hoof, and is not cloven footed, nor chews the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them shall be unclean.

27. And whatever goes upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.

28. And he who bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.

29. And these are those which are unclean to you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,

30. and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.

31. These are those which are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening.

32. And upon whatever any of them falls when they are dead, it shall be unclean, whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack. Whatever vessel it be, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shal

33. And every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and ye shall break it.

34. All food which may be eaten, that on which water comes, shall be unclean, and all drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean.

35. And everything upon which [any part] of their carcass falls shall be unclean, whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.

36. Nevertheless a fountain or a pit in which is a gathering of water shall be clean, but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean.

37. And if [any] of their carcass falls upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.

38. But if water is put upon the seed, and [any] of their carcass falls in it, it is unclean to you.

39. And if any beast, of which ye may eat, dies, he who touches the carcass of it shall be unclean until the evening.

40. And he who eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. He also who bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.

41. And every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

42. Whatever goes upon the belly, and whatever goes upon all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat, for they are an abomination.

43. Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, nor shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled by it.

44. For I am LORD your God. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and become ye holy, since I am holy. Neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moves upon the earth.

45. For I am LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. Ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

46. This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps upon the earth,

47. to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.

## Leviticus 12

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives seed, and bears a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days, as in the days of the impurity of her sickness she shall be unclean.

3. And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

4. And she shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying thirty-three days. She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

5. But if she bears a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity, and she shall continue in the blood of [her] purifying sixty-six days.

6. And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, to the door of the tent of meeting, t

7. And he shall offer it before LORD, and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.

8. And if her means are not sufficient for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall

1. And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his flesh a leprous disease, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.

3. And the priest shall look on the disease in the skin of the flesh, and if the hair in the disease be turned white, and the appearance of the disease is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a leprous disease. And the priest shal

4. And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance of it is not deeper than the skin, and the hair of it be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the disease seven days.

5. And the priest shall look on him the seventh day, and, behold, if in his eyes the disease is arrested, and the disease is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more.

6. And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day, and, behold, if the disease is dim, and the disease be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab, and he shall wash his clothes, and be c

7. But if the scab spreads abroad in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again.

8. And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scab is spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous disease.

9. When the leprous disease is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.

10. And the priest shall look, and, behold, if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the rising,

11. it is an old leprous disease in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.

12. And if the leprous disease breaks out abroad in the skin, and the leprous disease covers all the skin of the disease from his head even to his feet, as far as appears to the priest,

13. then the priest shall look. And, behold, if the leprous disease has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [of] the disease. It is all turned white; he is clean.

14. But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.

15. And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; it is a leprous disease.

16. Or if the raw flesh turns again, and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest.

17. And the priest shall look on him, and, behold, if the disease is turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [of] the disease; he is clean.

18. And when the flesh has a boil in the skin of it, and it is healed,

19. and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown to the priest.

20. And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the appearance of it is lower than the skin, and the hair of it be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous disease; it has broken out in the boil.

21. But if the priest looks on it, and, behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it is not lower than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.

22. And if it spreads abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a disease.

23. But if the bright spot stays in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

24. Or when the flesh has a burning by fire in the skin of it, and the quick of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,

25. then the priest shall look upon it. And, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance of it is deeper than the skin, it is a leprous disease. It has broken out in the burning, and the priest shall pron

27. And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day. If it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.

28. And if the bright spot stays in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar of the burning.

29. And when a man or woman has a disease upon the head or upon the beard,

30. then the priest shall look on the disease. And, behold, if the appearance of it is deeper than the skin, and there is yellow thin hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scall. It is a leprous disease of th

36. then the priest shall look on him. And, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair, he is unclean.

37. But if in his eyes the scall is arrested, and black hair is grown up in it, the scall is healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

38. And when a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the flesh, even white bright spots,

39. then the priest shall look. And, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh is of a dull white, it is a tetter. It has broken out in the skin; he is clean.

40. And if a man's hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; he is clean.

41. And if his hair is fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; he is clean.

42. But if there is a reddish-white disease in the bald head, or the bald forehead, it is a leprous disease breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

43. Then the priest shall look upon him, and, behold, if the rising of the disease is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of a leprous disease in the skin of the flesh,

44. he is a leprous man; he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his disease is in his head.

45. And the man with a leprous disease in whom the disease is, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

46. All the days in which the disease is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean. He shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.

48. whether it be in warp, or woof, of linen, or of woolen, whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin,

49. if the disease is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is a leprous disease, and shall be shown to the priest.

50. And the priest shall look upon the disease, and shut up the disease seven days.

51. And he shall look on the disease on the seventh day. If the disease be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for, the disease is a fretting leprosy, it is unclean.

52. And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woolen or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the disease is, for it is a fretting leprosy. It shall be burnt in the fire.

53. And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the disease be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin,

54. then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the disease is, and he shall shut it up seven more days.

55. And the priest shall look, after the disease is washed, and, behold, if the disease has not changed its color, and the disease be not spread, it is unclean. Thou shall burn it in the fire. It is a fret, whether the bareness be insi

56. And if the priest looks, and, behold, the disease is dim after the washing of it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof.

57. And if it still appears in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out. Thou shall burn that in which the disease is with fire.

58. And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it be, which thou shall wash, if the disease be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

59. This is the law of a leprous disease in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

## Leviticus 14

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. This shall be the law of the man with a leprous disease in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest,

3. and the priest shall go forth out of the camp. And the priest shall look, and, behold, if a leprous disease be healed in the man with a leprous disease,

4. then the priest shall command to take two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop for him who is to be cleansed.

5. And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.

6. As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.

7. And he shall sprinkle seven times upon him who is to be cleansed from the leprous disease, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field.

8. And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.

9. And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off. And he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he sh

10. And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

11. And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed, and those things, before LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting.

12. And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before LORD.

13. And he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary. For as the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the trespass-offering; it is most holy.

14. And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot

15. And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.

16. And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before LORD.

17. And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand the priest shall put upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the t

18. And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest shall make atonement for him before LORD.

19. And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness, and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering.

20. And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar, and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

21. And if he is poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a lo

22. and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get, and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.

23. And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting, before LORD.

24. And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before LORD.

25. And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering. And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and

30. And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,

31. even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering, and the priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before LORD.

32. This is the law of him in whom is a leprous disease, who is not able to get [what pertains] to his cleansing.

33. And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

34. When ye have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house of the land of your possession,

35. then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seems to me to be as it were a disease in the house.

36. And the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to see the disease, that all that is in the house not be made unclean. And afterward the priest shall go in to see the house,

37. and he shall look on the disease. And, behold, if the disease is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance of it is lower than the wall [surface],

38. then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.

39. And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look. And, behold, if the disease be spread in the walls of the house,

40. then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the disease is, and cast them into an unclean place outside the city.

41. And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, outside the city into an unclean place.

42. And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones. And he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.

43. And if the disease comes again, and breaks out in the house, after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,

44. then the priest shall come in and look. And, behold, if the disease be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

45. And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber of it, and all the mortar of the house, and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

46. Moreover he who goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.

47. And he who lays in the house shall wash his clothes. And he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

48. And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the disease is healed.

49. And he shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop to cleanse the house.

50. And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.

51. And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.

52. And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet,

53. but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.

54. This is the law for all manner of a leprous disease, and for a scall,

55. and for a leprous disease of a garment, and for a house,

56. and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot,

57. to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean. This is the law of a leprous disease.

## Leviticus 15

1. And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When any man has an issue out of his flesh, he is unclean because of his issue.

3. And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue, whether his flesh runs with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.

4. Every bed on which he who has the issue lays shall be unclean, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.

5. And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

6. And he who sits on anything on which he who has the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

7. And he who touches the flesh of him who has the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

8. And if he who has the issue spits upon him who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

9. And whatever saddle he who has the issue rides upon shall be unclean.

10. And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. And he who bears those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

11. And whomever he who has the issue touches, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

12. And the earthen vessel, which he who has the issue touches, shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

13. And when he who has an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

14. And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before LORD to the door of the tent of meeting, and give them to the priest.

15. And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and the priest shall make atonement for him before LORD for his issue.

16. And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.

17. And every garment, and every skin, on which is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.

18. The woman also with whom a man shall lay with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening.

19. And if a woman has an issue, [and] her issue in her flesh is blood, she shall be seven days in her impurity, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.

20. And everything that she lays upon in her impurity shall be unclean. Also everything that she sits upon shall be unclean.

21. And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

22. And whoever touches anything that she sits upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

23. And if it be on the bed, or on anything on which she sits, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until the evening.

24. And if any man lays with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lays shall be unclean.

25. And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she has an issue beyond the time of her impurity, she shall be all the days of the issue of her uncleanness as in the days of her impurity; s

26. Every bed on which she lays all the days of her issue shall be to her as the bed of her impurity, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.

27. And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

28. But if she is cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

29. And on the eighth day she shall take to her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.

30. And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and the priest shall make atonement for her before LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.

31. Thus ye shall separate the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, that they not die in their uncleanness when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them.

32. This is the law of him who has an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goes from him, so that he is unclean thereby,

33. and of her who is sick with her impurity, and of him who has an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him who lays with her who is unclean.

## Leviticus 16

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before LORD, and died,

2. and LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy brother, that he not come at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark, that he not die, for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat

3. Aaron shall come into the holy place this way: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.

4. He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen sash, and he shall be attired with the linen miter. They are the holy garments, and he shall bathe his fle

10. But the goat, on which the lot fell for the scapegoat, shall be set alive before LORD, to make atonement for him, to send him away for the scapegoat into the wilderness.

11. And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself.

12. And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil.

13. And he shall put the incense upon the fire before LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he not die.

14. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east. And he shall sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times before the mercy-seat.

15. Then he shall kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-

18. And he shall go out to the altar that is before LORD, and make atonement for it. And shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.

19. And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.

20. And when he has made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat.

21. And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins. And he shall put them upon the head of the goat, a

22. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities to a solitary land. And he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.

23. And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there.

28. And he who burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

29. And it shall be a statute forever to you. In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger who sojourns among you.

30. For on this day atonement shall be made for you, to cleanse you. Ye shall be clean from all your sins before LORD.

31. It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and ye shall afflict your souls. It is a statute forever.

32. And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead, shall make the atonement. And he shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments,

33. and shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.

34. And this shall be an everlasting statute to you, to make atonement for the sons of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as LORD commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 17

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, This is the thing which LORD has commanded, saying,

3. Whatever man there is of the house of Israel, who kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp,

4. and has not brought it to the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation to LORD before the tabernacle of LORD, blood shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people

5. to the end that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them to LORD, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of p

6. And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of LORD at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor to LORD.

7. And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.

8. And thou shall say to them, Whatever man there is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who offers a burnt-offering or sacrifice,

9. and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it to LORD, that man shall be cut off from his people.

10. And whatever man there is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who eats any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

11. For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life.

12. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, nor shall any stranger that sojourns among you eat blood.

13. And whatever man there is of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who takes any beast or bird in hunting that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood of it, and cover it with dust.

14. For as to the life of all flesh, the blood of it is with the life of it. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh, for the life of all flesh is the blood of it. Whoever eats it shall be c

16. But if he does not wash them, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.

## Leviticus 18

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, I am LORD your God.

3. Ye shall not do after the doings of the land of Egypt, in which ye dwelt, and ye shall not do after the doings of the land of Canaan, where I bring you, nor shall ye walk in their statutes.

4. Ye shall do my ordinances, and ye shall keep my statutes, to walk therein. I am LORD your God.

5. Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them. I am LORD.

6. None of you shall approach to any who are near of kin to him, to uncover nakedness. I am LORD.

7. The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, thou shall not uncover. She is thy mother. Thou shall not uncover her nakedness,

8. the nakedness of thy father's wife. It is thy father's nakedness.

9. The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shall not uncover.

10. The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shall not uncover, for theirs is thine own nakedness.

11. The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shall not uncover her nakedness.

12. Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister. She is thy father's near kinswoman.

13. Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

14. Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother. Thou shall not approach to his wife. She is thine aunt.

15. Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law. She is thy son's wife. Thou shall not uncover her nakedness.

16. Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife. It is thy brother's nakedness.

17. Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter. Thou shall not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They are near kinswomen. It is iniquity.

18. And thou shall not take a wife in addition to her sister, to be a rival [to her], to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time.

19. And thou shall not approach to a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.

20. And thou shall not lay carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with her.

21. And thou shall not give any of thy seed to make them pass through [the fire] to Molech, neither shall thou profane the name of thy God. I am LORD.

22. Thou shall not lay with mankind, as with womankind. It is abomination.

23. And thou shall not lay with any beast to defile thyself with it, nor shall any woman stand before a beast, to lay down with it. It is a perversion.

24. Do not defile ye yourselves in any of these things. For in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you,

25. and the land is defiled. Therefore I visit the iniquity of it upon it, and the land vomits out her inhabitants.

26. Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and my ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourns among you,

27. (for all these abominations the men of the land have done, who were before you, and the land is defiled),

28. that the land not vomit you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.

29. For whoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.

30. Therefore ye shall keep my charge, that ye not practice any of these abominable customs, which were practiced before you, and that ye not defile yourselves in it. I am LORD your God.

## Leviticus 19

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and say to them, Ye shall be holy, for I LORD your God am holy.

3. Every man shall fear his mother, and his father. And ye shall keep my Sabbaths. I am LORD your God.

4. Turn ye not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods. I am LORD your God.

5. And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.

6. It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow. And if any remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.

7. And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination. It shall not be accepted.

8. But he who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of LORD, and that soul shall be cut off from his people.

9. And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shall not wholly reap the corners of thy field, nor shall thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.

10. And thou shall not glean thy vineyard, nor shall thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard. Thou shall leave them for the poor man and for the sojourner. I am LORD your God.

11. Ye shall not steal, nor shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.

12. And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy God. I am LORD.

13. Thou shall not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.

14. Thou shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but thou shall fear thy God. I am LORD.

15. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. Thou shall not respect the person of the poor man, nor honor the person of the mighty man, but thou shall judge thy neighbor in righteousness.

16. Thou shall not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people, neither shall thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor. I am LORD.

17. Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy heart. Thou shall surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.

18. Thou shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of thy people, but thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. I am LORD.

19. Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shall not let thy cattle engender with a diverse kind. Thou shall not sow thy field with two kinds of seed, neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.

20. And whoever lays carnally with a woman, who is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her, they shall be punished. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.

21. And he shall bring his trespass-offering to LORD, to the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.

22. And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before LORD for his sin which he has sinned. And the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.

23. And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit of it as their uncircumcision. Three years they shall be as uncircumcised to you; it shall not be eaten.

24. But in the fourth year all the fruit of it shall be holy, for giving praise to LORD.

25. And in the fifth year ye shall eat of the fruit of it, that it may yield to you the increase of it. I am LORD your God.

26. Ye shall not eat anything with the blood. Neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practice augury.

27. Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, nor shall thou mar the corners of thy beard.

28. Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you. I am LORD.

29. Do not profane thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

30. Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am LORD.

31. Do not turn to those who have familiar spirits, nor to the wizards. Do not seek them out, to be defiled by them. I am LORD your God.

32. Thou shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shall fear thy God. I am LORD.

33. And if a stranger sojourns with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.

34. The stranger that sojourns with you shall be to you as the home-born among you, and thou shall love him as thyself, for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. I am LORD your God.

35. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.

36. Ye shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin. I am LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.

37. And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them. I am LORD.

## Leviticus 20

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Moreover, thou shall say to the sons of Israel, Whoever he is of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who gives of his seed to Molech, he shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone h

3. I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

4. And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives of his seed to Molech, and do not put him to death,

5. then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all who play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people.

6. And the soul that turns to those who have familiar spirits, and to the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

7. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and become ye holy, for I am LORD your God.

8. And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them. I am LORD who sanctifies you.

9. For he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.

10. And the man who commits adultery with another man's wife, even he who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

11. And the man who lays with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness. Both of them shall surely be put to death, their blood shall be upon them.

12. And if a man lays with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have wrought perversion. Their blood shall be upon them.

13. And if a man lays with a man, as with a woman, both of them have committed abomination. They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

14. And if a man takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burnt with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you.

15. And if a man lays with a beast, he shall surely be put to death, and ye shall kill the beast.

16. And if a woman approaches to any beast, and lays down with it, thou shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

17. And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing, and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He

18. And if a man shall lay with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood. And both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

19. And thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister, for he has made naked his near kin. They shall bear their iniquity.

20. And if a man shall lay with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness. They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.

21. And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.

22. Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them, that the land, where I bring you to dwell in it, not vomit you out.

23. And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I cast out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

24. But I have said to you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples.

25. Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean. And ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems

26. And ye shall be holy to me, for I, LORD, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be mine.

27. A man or also a woman who has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death. They shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.

3. And for his sister a virgin, who is near to him, who has had no husband, for her he may defile himself.

4. He shall not defile himself, [who is] a chief man among his people, to profane himself.

5. They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.

6. They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God. For they offer the offerings of LORD made by fire, the bread of their God. Therefore they shall be holy.

7. They shall not take a woman who is a harlot, or profane, neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband, for he is holy to his God.

8. Thou shall sanctify him therefore, for he offers the bread of thy God. He shall be holy to thee, for I LORD, who sanctify you, am holy.

9. And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father. She shall be burnt with fire.

10. And he who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor tear his clothes,

11. neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother,

12. neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am LORD.

13. And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

14. A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these he shall not take, but he shall take to wife a virgin of his own people.

15. And he shall not profane his seed among his people, for I am LORD who sanctifies him.

16. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

17. Speak to Aaron, saying, Whoever he is of thy seed throughout their generations who has a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.

18. For whatever man he is who has a blemish, he shall not approach: [not] a blind man, or a lame [man], or he who has a flat nose, or anything superfluous,

19. or a man who is broken-footed, or broken-handed,

20. or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or who has a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or has his testicles broken.

21. No man of the seed of Aaron the priest, who has a blemish, shall come near to offer the offerings of LORD made by fire; he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.

22. He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy,

23. only he shall not go in to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish, that he not profane my sanctuaries, for I am LORD who sanctifies them.

24. So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel.

## Leviticus 22

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they hallow to me, and that they not profane my holy name. I am LORD.

3. Say to them, Whoever he is of all your seed throughout your generations, that approaches to the holy things, which the sons of Israel hallow to LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me. I am

4. Whatever man of the seed of Aaron being a man with a leprous disease, or has an issue, he shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from h

5. or whoever touches any creeping thing, by which he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has,

6. the soul that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening. And shall not eat of the holy things unless he bathe his flesh in water.

7. And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.

8. That which dies of itself, or is torn by beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself with it. I am LORD.

9. They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die in it if they profane it. I am LORD who sanctifies them.

10. There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing. A sojourner of the priest's, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

11. But if a priest buys any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it, and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.

12. And if a priest's daughter be married to a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.

13. But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's bread, but there shall no stranger eat of it.

14. And if a man eats of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part of it to it, and shall give the holy thing to the priest.

15. And they shall not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they offer to LORD,

16. and [so] cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when they eat their holy things, for I am LORD who sanctifies them.

17. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, Whoever he is of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, who offers his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewi

19. that ye may be accepted, [ye shall offer] a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.

20. But whatever has a blemish, that ye shall not offer, for it shall not be acceptable for you.

21. And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace-offerings to LORD to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it.

22. Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a skin tumor, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these to LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar to LORD.

23. Either a bullock or a lamb that has anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that thou may offer for a freewill-offering, but it shall not be accepted for a vow.

24. That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer to LORD, neither shall ye do [thus] in your land.

25. Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them; there is a blemish in them. They shall not be accepted for you.

26. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

27. When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam, and from the eighth day and after that it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire to LORD.

28. And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.

29. And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to LORD, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.

30. It shall be eaten on the same day. Ye shall leave none of it until the morning. I am LORD.

31. Therefore ye shall keep my commandments, and do them. I am LORD.

32. And ye shall not profane my holy name, but I will be hallowed among the sons of Israel. I am LORD who hallows you,

33. who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am LORD.

## Leviticus 23

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, The set feasts of LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.

3. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. Ye shall do no manner of work. It is a Sabbath to LORD in all your dwellings.

4. These are the set feasts of LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season:

5. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, is LORD's Passover.

6. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to LORD. Ye shall eat unleavened bread seven days.

7. In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation. Ye shall do no servile work.

8. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire to LORD seven days. In the seventh day is a holy convocation, ye shall do no servile work.

9. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest of it, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest.

11. And he shall wave the sheaf before LORD, to be accepted for you. On the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.

12. And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering to LORD.

13. And the meal-offering of it shall be two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to LORD for a sweet savor. And the drink-offering of it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.

14. And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

15. And ye shall count to you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering, there shall be complete seven Sabbaths.

16. Ye shall number fifty days, even to the morrow after the seventh Sabbath, and ye shall offer a new meal-offering to LORD.

17. Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts [of an ephah]. They shall be of fine flour. They shall be baked with leaven, for first-fruits to LORD.

18. And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams. They shall be a burnt-offering to LORD, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by

19. And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.

20. And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to LORD for the priest.

21. And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day, there shall be a holy convocation to you. Ye shall do no servile work. It is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

22. And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shall not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shall thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. Thou shall leave them for the poor man, and for the sojourner. I am LORD your Go

23. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.

25. Ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall offer an offering made by fire to LORD.

26. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

27. However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement. It shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall afflict your souls, and ye shall offer an offering made by fire to LORD.

28. And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before LORD your God.

29. For whatever soul it be who shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.

30. And whatever soul it be who does any manner of work in that same day, that soul I will destroy from among his people.

31. Ye shall do no manner of work. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

32. It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls. In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, ye shall keep your Sabbath.

33. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

34. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days to LORD.

35. On the first day shall be a holy convocation. Ye shall do no servile work.

36. Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire to LORD. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall offer an offering made by fire to LORD. It is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.

37. These are the set feasts of LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day.

38. Besides the Sabbaths of LORD, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give to LORD.

39. However on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of LORD seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.

40. And ye shall take to you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before LORD your God seven days.

41. And ye shall keep it a feast to LORD seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations. Ye shall keep it in the seventh month.

42. Ye shall dwell in booths seven days. All who are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths,

43. that your generations may know that I made the sons of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am LORD your God.

44. And Moses declared to the sons of Israel the set feasts of LORD.

## Leviticus 24

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they bring to thee pure beaten olive oil for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.

3. Aaron shall keep it outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, in order from evening to morning before LORD continually. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.

4. He shall keep the lamps upon the pure candlestick in order before LORD continually.

5. And thou shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it. Two tenth parts [of an ephah] shall be in one cake.

6. And thou shall set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before LORD.

7. And thou shall put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to LORD.

8. Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before LORD continually. It is on the behalf of the sons of Israel, an everlasting covenant.

9. And it shall be for Aaron and his sons. And they shall eat it in a holy place, for it is most holy to him of the offerings of LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

10. And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel. And the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp,

11. and the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed. And they brought him to Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.

12. And they put him in ward, that it might be declared to them at the mouth of LORD.

13. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

14. Bring forth him who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

15. And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.

16. And he who blasphemes the name of LORD, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. As well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.

17. And he who smites any man mortally shall surely be put to death.

18. And he who smites a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.

19. And if a man causes a blemish in his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him:

20. injury for injury, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered to him.

21. And he who kills a beast shall make it good. And he who kills a man shall be put to death.

22. Ye shall have one manner of law, as for the sojourner, as for the home-born, for I am LORD your God.

23. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought forth him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the sons of Israel did as LORD commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 25

1. And LORD spoke to Moses on mount Sinai, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath to LORD.

3. Six years thou shall sow thy field, and six years thou shall prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits of it,

4. but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to LORD. Thou shall neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.

5. That which grows of itself of thy harvest thou shall not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shall not gather. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.

6. And the Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you: for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourns with thee.

7. And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, all the increase of it shall be for food.

8. And thou shall number seven Sabbaths of years to thee, seven times seven years, and there shall be to thee the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.

9. Then thou shall send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. In the day of atonement ye shall send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.

10. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants of it. It shall be a jubilee to you, and ye shall return every man to his possession, and ye shall return every man to his famil

11. That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. Ye shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather in it of the undressed vines.

12. For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. Ye shall eat the increase of it out of the field.

13. In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man to his possession.

14. And if thou sell anything to thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not wrong each other.

15. According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shall buy of thy neighbor, [and] according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to thee.

16. According to the multitude of the years thou shall increase the price of it, and according to the fewness of the years thou shall diminish the price of it, for the number of the crops he sells to thee.

17. And ye shall not wrong each other, but thou shall fear thy God, for I am LORD your God.

18. Therefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

19. And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in safety in it.

20. And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase,

21. then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.

22. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old storage, until the ninth year. Until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old storage.

23. And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

24. And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.

25. If thy brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possession, then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and shall redeem that which his brother has sold.

26. And if a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes rich and finds sufficient to redeem it,

27. then let him reckon the years of the sale of it, and restore the excess to the man to whom he sold it, and he shall return to his possession.

28. But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then that which he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the year of jubilee. And in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.

29. And if a man sells a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.

30. And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not go out in the jubilee.

31. But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.

32. Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.

33. And if a man purchases from the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee. For the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.

34. But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.

35. And if thy brother becomes poor, and his hand fails with thee, then thou shall uphold him; he shall live with thee [as] a stranger and a sojourner.

36. Take thou no interest from him or increase, but fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee.

37. Thou shall not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy food for profit.

38. I am LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, [and] to be your God.

39. And if thy brother becomes poor with thee, and sells himself to thee, thou shall not make him to serve as a bondman.

40. He shall be with thee as a hired servant, and as a sojourner. He shall serve with thee to the year of jubilee.

41. Then he shall go out from thee, he and his sons with him, and shall return to his own family. And he shall return to the possession of his fathers.

42. For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as bondmen.

43. Thou shall not rule over him with rigor, but shall fear thy God.

44. And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shall have, from the nations that are round about you, ye shall buy bondmen and bondmaids from them.

45. Moreover of the sons of the strangers who sojourn among you, ye shall buy from them, and from their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land, and they shall be your possession.

46. And ye shall make them an inheritance for your sons after you, to hold for a possession. Ye shall take them your bondmen forever, but over your brothers the sons of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.

47. And if a stranger or sojourner with thee becomes rich, and thy brother becomes poor beside him, and sells himself to the stranger [or] sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family,

48. he may be redeemed after he is sold. One of his brothers may redeem him.

49. Or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him. Or any who is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him. Or if he becomes rich, he may redeem himself.

50. And he shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee. And the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years. He shall be with him according to the time of a hire

51. If there be yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

52. And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him. He shall give back the price of his redemption according to his years.

53. He shall be with him as a servant hired year by year. He shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.

54. And if he is not redeemed by these [means], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his sons with him.

55. For the sons of Israel are servants to me. They are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. I am LORD your God.

## Leviticus 26

1. Ye shall make for you no idols. Neither shall ye rear up for you a graven image, or a pillar. Neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it. For I am LORD your God.

2. Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am LORD.

3. If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them,

4. then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

5. And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time, and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

6. And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lay down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, nor shall the sword go through your land.

7. And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.

8. And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

9. And I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.

10. And ye shall eat old storage long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.

11. And I will set my tabernacle among you, and my soul shall not abhor you.

12. And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.

13. I am LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen. And I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.

14. But if ye will not hearken to me, and will not do all these commandments,

15. and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant,

16. I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away. And ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

17. And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies. Those who hate you shall rule over you, and ye shall flee when no man pursues you.

18. And if for these things ye will not yet hearken to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.

19. And I will break the pride of your power. And I will make your sky as iron, and your earth as brass,

20. and your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.

21. And if ye walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

22. And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your sons, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, and your ways shall become desolate.

23. And if by these things ye will not be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me,

24. then I also will walk contrary to you, and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.

25. And I will bring a sword upon you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant, and ye shall be gathered together within your cities. And I will send the pestilence among you, and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enem

26. When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight, and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.

27. And if for all this ye will not hearken to me, but walk contrary to me,

28. then I will walk contrary to you in wrath, and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.

29. And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters ye shall eat.

30. And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.

31. And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.

32. And I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.

33. And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you, and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.

34. Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lays desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land, even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.

35. As long as it lays desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your Sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

36. And as for those who are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as a man flees from the sword, and they shall fall w

37. And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when no man pursues. And ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

38. And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

39. And those who are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands, and also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away with them.

40. And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,

41. I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity,

42. then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the land.

43. The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its Sabbaths while it lays desolate without them. And they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abh

44. And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them, for I am LORD their God,

45. but for their sakes I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am LORD.

46. These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which LORD made between him and the sons of Israel on mount Sinai by Moses.

## Leviticus 27

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for LORD by thy estimation.

3. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

4. And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.

5. And if it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

6. And if it be from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

7. And if it be from sixty years old and upward, if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

8. But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.

9. And if it be a beast, of which men offer an oblation to LORD, all that any man gives of such to LORD shall be holy.

10. He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.

11. And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation to LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest,

12. and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad. As thou the priest values it, so shall it be.

13. But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to thy estimation.

14. And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad. As the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

15. And if he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be his.

16. And if a man shall sanctify to LORD part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing of it, the sowing of a homer of barley at fifty shekels of silver.

17. If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.

18. But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.

19. And if he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.

20. And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more,

21. but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to LORD, as a field set apart; the possession of it shall be the priest's.

22. And if he sanctifies to LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,

23. then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of thy estimation to the year of jubilee, and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing to LORD.

24. In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.

25. And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

26. Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to LORD, no man shall sanctify it, whether it be ox or sheep, it is LORD's.

27. And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it, or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.

28. Notwithstanding, nothing set apart, that a man shall set apart to LORD of all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; everything set apart is most holy to LORD.

29. No one set apart, who shall be set apart from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.

30. And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is LORD's; it is holy to LORD.

31. And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it the fifth part of it.

32. And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to LORD.

33. He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it. And if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

34. These are the commandments, which LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel on mount Sinai.
