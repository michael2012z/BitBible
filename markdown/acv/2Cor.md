# 2 Corinthians

## 2 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the congregation of God that is at Corinth, with all the sanctified who are in the whole of Achaia.

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all encouragement,

4. who encourages us in all our affliction, in order for us to be able to encourage those in every affliction, through the encouragement of which we ourselves are encouraged by God.

5. Because, as the sufferings of the Christ abound to us, so also our encouragement abounds through the Christ.

6. But whether we are oppressed, it is for your encouragement and salvation, which works by endurance from the same sufferings that we also experience (and our hope for you is steadfast), or we are encouraged, it is for your encourage

7. knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement.

8. For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about our affliction that happened to us in Asia, because we were extraordinarily weighed down, above strength, so as for us to despair even to be alive.

9. But we ourselves have had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we should not be trusting in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.

10. Who rescued us out of so great a death, and does rescue, in whom we have hoped that he will also still rescue.

11. And of you who help together by supplication for us (a gift for us from many persons, because of many), so that there may be gratitude about you.

12. For our pride is this (the testimony from our conscience), that we behave in the world in the simplicity and purity of God, not by fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, and especially toward you.

13. For we write no other thing to you, but rather what ye read or also acknowledge. And I hope ye will also acknowledge until the end,

14. as also ye did acknowledge us in part, because we are your boast, just as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.

15. And in this confidence I intended to come to you earlier, so that ye might have a second benefit,

16. and to pass through you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be helped on the way toward Judea.

17. Therefore intending this, did I accordingly employ anything in lightness? Or what I decide, do I decide according to flesh, so that it would be with me the yes, yes and the no, no?

18. But God is faithful, because our word toward you became not, yes and no.

19. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was proclaimed among you by us (by me and Silvanus and Timothy) became not, yes and no, but in him has become, yes.

20. For as many as be promises of God, in him is the Yes, and in him the Truly, for glory to God through us.

21. Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and who anointed us, is God.

22. He also is who put a seal on us, and who gave the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.

23. But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that I did not yet come to Corinth, sparing you.

24. Not because we lord over your faith, but are co-workmen of your joy, for by faith ye stand.

## 2 Corinthians 2

1. But I determined this in myself, not to come again to you in sadness.

2. For if I make you sad, who then is he who makes me glad except he who is made sad by me?

3. And I wrote this same thing to you, so that when I came, I would not have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, having been confident toward you all, because my joy is of all of you.

4. For out of much stress and dismay of heart, through many tears, I wrote to you, not that ye would be grieved, but that ye might know the love that I have so much more for you.

5. But if any man has caused sadness, he has not caused me sadness, but in part (that I may not bear down) you all.

6. Sufficient to such a man is this punishment by the many,

7. so that instead, for you rather to forgive and encourage, lest perhaps such a man would be swallowed up with too much sorrow.

8. Therefore I beseech you to affirm love for him.

9. For I also wrote for this, so that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.

10. But to whom ye forgive anything, I too. For I also, whom I have forgiven (if anything), I have forgiven because of you in the presence of Christ,

11. so that we may not be exploited by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his methods.

12. Now having come to Troas for the good-news of the Christ, and a door having been opened to me in Lord,

13. I had no rest in my spirit, my not finding Titus my brother. But having departed from them, I went forth into Macedonia.

14. And thanks is to God who always causes us to triumph in the Christ, and who makes manifest the aroma of the knowledge of him in every place, through us.

15. Because we are a fragrance of Christ to God, in those being saved and in those perishing:

16. to the one an odor of death for death, and to the other an aroma of life for life. And who is adequate for these things?

17. For we are not as other men, huckstering the word of God, but as from purity. But we speak in Christ as from God in the sight of God.

## 2 Corinthians 3

1. Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Unless we need, as some men, commendatory letters to you or commendatory from you?

2. Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,

3. being seen that ye are a letter of Christ, administered by us, written not in ink, but in the Spirit of the living God, not in stony tablets, but in fleshly tablets, in hearts.

4. And we have such confidence toward God through Christ,

5. not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,

6. who also made us qualified helpers of a new covenant, not of a document, but of a spirit, for the document kills but the spirit makes alive.

7. But if the administration of death in writings engraved on stones occurred in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not gaze upon the face of Moses because of the fading glory of his countenance,

8. how will the administration of the spirit not be more in glory?

9. For if the administration of condemnation has glory, the administration of righteousness excels much more in glory.

10. For also that which has been glorified, has not been glorified in this regard, because of the glory that transcends.

11. For if that which is abolished was through glory, much more that which remains is in glory.

12. Having therefore such a hope we use great boldness,

13. and are not as Moses. He put a veil over his face in order for the sons of Israel not to gaze on the end of the fading.

14. But their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old testament, not being uncovered, which thing is abolished in Christ.

15. But to this day when Moses is read, a veil lays upon their heart.

16. But whenever it turns to Lord, the veil is removed.

17. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of Lord is, there is liberty.

18. But we all, with unveiled face seeing by reflection the glory of Lord, are transformed into the same likeness from glory to glory, just as from the Spirit of Lord.

## 2 Corinthians 4

1. Because of this (having this ministry), in as much as we received mercy, we do not become discouraged.

2. But we have renounced the covert things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor misrepresenting the word of God, but by the disclosure of the truth, commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.

3. But even if our good-news is concealed, it is concealed in those who are perishing,

4. in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, in order for the light of the good-news of the glory of the Christ (who is a likeness of God) not to shine forth to them.

5. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves are your bondmen through Jesus.

6. Because it is God who said, Out of darkness light is to shine, who shone in our hearts for an enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the presence of Jesus Christ.

7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the excellence of the power may be of God and not from us,

8. restricted in everything, yet not confined, perplexed but not despairing,

9. persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed.

10. Always carrying around in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, so that also the life of Jesus may be made visible in our body.

11. For we who live are always given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that also the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh.

12. So death indeed works in us, but life in you.

13. And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke, we also believe, and therefore we speak,

14. knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up through Jesus, and will present us with you.

15. For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace, which has multiplied because of the thankfulness of the many, may abound for the glory of God.

16. Therefore we are not discouraged, but even if the outer man of us is perishing, yet the inner man is renewed day by day.

17. For our slight momentary affliction works for us an eternal weight of glory from extraordinariness to extraordinariness,

18. while we look not at things seen, but at things not seen. For things seen are temporal, but things not seen are eternal.

## 2 Corinthians 5

1. For we know that if the earthly house of our tent were destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.

2. For also in this we groan, longing to clothe ourselves with our habitation from heaven,

3. if indeed also having put it on we will not be found naked.

4. For also those who are in the tent groan, being burdened, not in that we want to undress, but to clothe ourselves, so that the mortal may be swallowed up by the life.

5. Now he who wrought us for this same thing is God, who also gave us the pledge of the Spirit.

6. Therefore always being confident, and knowing that while at home in the body we are absent from the Lord,

7. for we walk by faith, not by sight.

8. And we are confident, and are pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be at home near the Lord.

9. Therefore also we aspire, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to him.

10. For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of the Christ, so that each man may receive back about the things that he did through the body, whether good or bad.

11. Having seen therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. But we have been manifested to God, and I hope also to have been manifested in your consciences.

12. For we are not commending ourselves again to you, but giving you an opportunity of boasting about us, so that ye may have for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.

13. For whether we are beside ourselves to God, or we are of normal mind, it is for you.

14. For the love of Christ holds us together, having judge this, that if one died for all, then all died.

15. And he died for all so that those who live would no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and was raised.

16. So that henceforth we know no man according to flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him no longer.

17. So then if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away, behold, all things have become new.

18. And all things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and who gave to us the ministry of reconciliation.

19. How that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.

20. We are therefore, ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were calling through us. We plead on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.

21. For the man who knew no sin was made sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

## 2 Corinthians 6

1. And working jointly, we urge you also not to receive the grace of God in vain

2. (for he says, At an acceptable time I heard thee, and in a day of salvation I helped thee. Behold, now is an acceptable time. Behold, now is a day of salvation),

3. giving not one cause of stumbling in anything, so that the ministry may not be criticized,

4. but in everything commending ourselves as helpers of God, in much perseverance, in afflictions, in necessities, in restrictions,

5. in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hungerings,

6. in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in Holy Spirit, in non-hypocritical love,

7. in word of truth, in power of God, through the weapons of righteousness of the right hand and of the left,

8. through glory and disrepute, through slander and commendation; as deceitful, and yet true;

9. as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not put to death;

10. as grieving, but always rejoicing; as poor, but making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

11. O Corinthians, our mouth has been opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.

12. Ye are not limited in us, but ye are limited in your bowels.

13. But I speak the same recompense as to children, be ye also enlarged.

14. Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness? And what fellowship has light with darkness?

15. And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what share have believers with non-believers?

16. And what mutual agreement has a temple of God with idols? For ye are a temple of the living God, just as God said, I will dwell in them, and will walk among them. And I will be their God, and they will be a people to me.

17. Therefore, Come ye out from among them, and be ye separated, says Lord, And touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you

18. and will be for a Father to you, and ye will be for sons and daughters to me, says Lord Almighty.

## 2 Corinthians 7

1. Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in fear of God.

2. Make room for us. We wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we exploited no man.

3. I speak not for condemnation, for I have said before that ye are in our hearts to die together and to live together.

4. Great is my boldness toward you, great is my pride for you. I have been filled with encouragement. I over-abound with joy in all our affliction.

5. For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had not one relief, but being oppressed in everything: battles outside, fears within.

6. Nevertheless God, who encourages the lowly, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.

7. And not only by his presence, but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged by you, reporting to us your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.

8. Because even though I grieved you in the letter, I am not remorseful (even though I was remorseful), for I perceive that that letter grieved you, even though for an hour.

9. Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved for repentance. For ye were grieved toward God, so that ye might suffer loss from us in nothing.

10. For sorrow toward God works repentance for salvation without regret, but the sorrow of the world works death.

11. For behold this same thing--your grieving toward God. How much eagerness it worked in you, even a defense, even indignation, even fear, even longing, even zeal, even vengeance! In everything ye demonstrated yourselves to be pure in

12. And so then although I wrote to you, it was not because of the man who did wrong, nor because of the man who was wronged, but in order to reveal to you your eagerness for us in the sight of God.

13. Because of this we have been encouraged. And from your encouragement, we rejoiced to a greater degree more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.

14. Because, if I have boasted anything to him about you, I am not ashamed, but as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boast to Titus became truth.

15. And his bowels are more abundant toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear and trembling.

16. I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.

## 2 Corinthians 8

1. And, brothers, we declare to you the grace of God that has been given in the congregations of Macedonia,

2. that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy, even from the depth of their poverty, abounded for the wealth of their generosity,

3. so that according to their ability, I testify, and beyond their ability, willingly,

4. with much exhortation, begging of us the favor, even the fellowship of service for the sanctified.

5. And it was not as we expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God,

6. for us to urge Titus that, as he earlier began this kindness, so he would even finish it for you also.

7. But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, be that ye may also abound in this kindness.

8. I speak not from commandment, but because of the zeal of others, also examining the genuineness of your love.

9. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich he became poor for your sakes, so that by that man's poverty ye might become rich.

10. And in this I give judgment, for this is expedient for you who earlier began, from a year ago, not only the doing but also the intending.

11. And now also finish the doing, so that just as was the willingness of the intending, so also to finish from the having.

12. For if the willingness is present, it is acceptable to the extent if some man has, not to the extent he does not have.

13. For it is not, so that ease is for others and stress for you, but out of parity your abundance at the present time is for the need of those men.

14. So that the abundance of those men may also happen for your need, so that there may become equity,

15. as it is written, he of much did not abound, and he of little did not lack.

16. But thanks to God who gives the same eagerness for you in the heart of Titus.

17. Because he indeed accepted the exhortation, but his own will being more zealous, he went forth to you.

18. And we sent along with him the brother whose praise in the good-news is throughout all the congregations.

19. And not only so, but who was also chosen by the congregations, a traveling companion of us with this gift administered by us, for the glory of the same Lord and our willingness.

20. Arranging this lest any man may criticize us in this bounty administered by us,

21. providing things right, not only in the sight of Lord, but also in the sight of men.

22. And we sent along with them our brother whom we often proved being diligent in many things, but is now much more diligent (with much confidence toward you)

23. whether on behalf of Titus my partner and co-workman for you, or our brothers, apostles of congregations, a glory of Christ.

24. Therefore show ye the proof of your love and our boast about you, for them in the face of the congregations.

## 2 Corinthians 9

1. For indeed it is superfluous for me to write to you about the service for the sanctified.

2. For I know your willingness, which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from a year ago. And your zeal provoked the majority.

3. But I sent the brothers so that our boast about you would not be empty in this regard. So that, as I said, ye may be prepared,

4. if somehow Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we (that we might not say, ye) would be embarrassed in this confidence of boast.

5. Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go ahead to you, and arrange in advance your gift that was earlier announced, for this to be ready this way as a gift and not as an exaction.

6. But this, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows in blessings will also reap in blessings.

7. Each man as he purposes in his heart, not from regret or from necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.

8. And God is able to abound all grace for you, so that always in everything having all sufficiency, ye may abound for every good work,

9. as it is written, He has scattered abroad. He has given to the poor. His righteousness endures into the age.

10. And he who supplies seed to the man who sows, and bread for eating, may he supply and multiply your seed, and may he increase the fruits of your righteousness,

11. being enriched in everything for every generosity, which works gratitude to God through us.

12. Because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the sanctified, but also abounding through many thanksgivings to God

13. through the evidence of this service, glorifying God at the subjection of your confession toward the good-news of the Christ, and at the generosity of the participation, for them and for all,

14. and by their supplication about you, yearning for you because of the transcending grace of God in you.

15. And thanks to God for his indescribable gift.

## 2 Corinthians 10

1. Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who indeed am lowly in presence among you, but am bold toward you when absent.

2. But I pray not to be bold when present with the confidence by which I consider to be valiant toward some who consider us as walking according to flesh.

3. For though walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.

4. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty in God for the demolition of strongholds,

5. casting down imaginations, and every high thing exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought captive into the obedience of the Christ,

6. and having in readiness to avenge every disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled.

7. Do ye look at things according to appearance. If any man has convinced himself to be of Christ, let him consider this again of himself, that, as he is of Christ, so also are we of Christ.

8. For even if I also should boast somewhat more abundantly about our authority (which the Lord gave us for building up, and not for tearing you down), I will not be shamed,

9. so that I would not seem as if to terrify you by the letters.

10. Because, The letters, he says, are indeed weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is disdained.

11. Let such a man think this, that such kind we are in word by letters when absent, we are also such kind when present in the work.

12. For we dare not classify or compare ourselves to some of those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, do not understand.

13. But we will not boast in things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the standard that God apportioned to us, of a measure to reach even as far as you.

14. For it is not as not reaching for you. We overextend ourselves. For we even reached as far as you in the good-news of the Christ,

15. not boasting in things immeasurable, in other men's labors, but having hope of your faith growing in you to be enlarged according to our measure for abundance,

16. in order to preach the good-news beyond you, not to boast in another measure, in things prepared.

17. But he who boasts should boast in Lord.

18. For he who commends himself, that man is not approved, but whom the Lord commends.

## 2 Corinthians 11

1. O that ye tolerated a little of my foolishness, but tolerate me too.

2. For I am jealous for you with a jealousy of God. For I betrothed you to one husband, a pure virgin to present to the Christ.

3. But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent enticed Eve by his craftiness, so your thoughts might be corrupted from the simplicity in the Christ.

4. For indeed if a man who comes, preaches another Jesus whom we did not preach, or ye receive another spirit that ye did not receive, or another good-news that ye did not accept, ye well tolerated it.

5. For I reckon to come short in nothing of those, superlative apostles.

6. But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge, but in everything made known in all things to you.

7. Or did I commit a sin lowering myself so that ye might be lifted up, because I preached to you the good-news of God freely?

8. I robbed other congregations, having taken a wage in order for your service.

9. And being present with you, and when needy, I was a burden to no man. For the brothers who came from Macedonia, they supplied my need. And in everything I kept, and I will keep myself non-burdensome to you.

10. The truth of Christ is in me that this pride in me will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.

11. Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.

12. But what I do, I also will do, so that I may cut off the opportunity of those who desire an opportunity, that in what they boast, they might appear just as we also.

13. For such men are FALSE apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves into apostles of Christ.

14. And no marvel, for even Satan disguises himself into an agent of light.

15. Therefore, it is no great thing if his helpers also disguise themselves as helpers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.

16. I say again, let not any man think me to be foolish, but if otherwise--even if as foolish--accept me, so that I also may boast some a little.

17. What I speak, I speak not according to Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of the boast.

18. Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.

19. For being wise, ye gladly tolerate the foolish.

20. For ye tolerate it if some man enslaves you, if some man devours you, if some man seizes you, if some man lifts himself up, if some man strikes you on the face.

21. I speak as from shame, that we were so weak. Yet in whatever any man may be bold in foolishness, I say I too am bold.

22. Are they Hebrews? I too. Are they Israelites? I too. Are they a seed of Abraham? I too.

23. Are they helpers of Christ? (I speak as being mad) I more: in toils, more abundantly; in stripes, countless; in prisons, more frequently; in deaths often.

24. From the Jews five times I received forty save one.

25. Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I was shipwrecked, I have done a night and a day in the depth,

26. in frequent journeys, in perils of flowing waters, in perils of bandits, in perils from my race, in perils from Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils at sea, in perils among FALSE brothers,

27. in toil and hardship, in frequent sleeplessness, in hunger and thirst, in frequent fasts, in cold and nakedness.

28. Besides the external things, crowding upon me daily is the care of all the congregations.

29. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I am not made fiery?

30. If it is necessary to boast, I will boast of the things of my weakness.

31. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed into the ages, knows that I do not lie.

32. In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes wanting to apprehend me.

33. And I was lowered in a hamper through a window through the wall, and escaped his hands.

## 2 Corinthians 12

1. (Really, to me boasting is not helpful.) For I will come to visions and revelations of Lord.

2. I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in body, I know not, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows) such a man was caught up as far as the third heaven.

3. And I know such a man (whether in body, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows)

4. that he was caught up into the paradise, and heard inexpressible sayings that are not permitted for a man to utter.

5. For such a man I will boast, but for myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.

6. For if I should want to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I refrain lest any man should reckon to me above what he sees of me or hears anything from me.

7. And so that I might not be over exalted by the extraordinariness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an agent of Satan so that he would buffet me, so that I would not be over exalted.

8. I besought the Lord thrice about this, that it might depart from me.

9. And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is made fully perfect in weakness. More gladly therefore I will boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of the Christ may reside in me.

10. Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in restrictions, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

11. I have become foolish, boasting. Ye compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I came short in nothing of those, superlative apostles, even though I am nothing.

12. Indeed the signs of the apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.

13. For what is there which ye were inferior to the other congregations? Except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.

14. Behold, a third time I fare readily to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek not the things of you, but you. For the children ought not lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

15. And I most gladly will spend, and will be spent for your souls. Even though more earnestly loving you, the worse I am loved.

16. But let it be. I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being clever, I caught you with bait.

17. Any man of whom I have sent to you, did I exploit you through him?

18. I encouraged Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in anything? Did we not walk in the same spirit, not in the same steps?

19. Again, do ye think that we are making defense to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edification.

20. For I fear lest somehow, having come, I may find you not such as I want, and I may be found by you such as ye do not want, lest somehow there be strifes, envyings, wraths, selfish ambitions, slanderings, whisperings, puffings up, t

21. lest having come again my God will make me low toward you, and I will bewail many of those who have sinned previously, and who did not repent from the trash and fornication and licentiousness that they committed.

## 2 Corinthians 13

1. This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two witnesses or three every saying will be confirmed.

2. I have told you before, and I say in advance, as present the second time, and now absent, I write to those who have previously sinned, and to all the others, that if I come to it again, I will not spare,

3. since ye seek proof of the Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you.

4. For even if he was crucified from weakness, yet he lives from the power of God. For we in him are also weak, but we will live with him from the power of God toward you.

5. Examine yourselves whether ye are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless ye are test-failing something.

6. But I hope that ye will know that we are not test-failing.

7. Now I pray to God, to do you nothing harmful, not that we would appear test-passing, but that ye would do right, even like we might be test-failing.

8. For we do not have any power against the truth, but for the truth.

9. For we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong. And this also we pray for, your full qualification.

10. Because of this I write these things while absent, so that I may not act harshly when present, according to the authority that the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.

11. Finally brothers, farewell. Be thoroughly prepared, be encouraged, think the same way, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.

12. Salute each other by a holy kiss.

13. All the sanctified salute you.

14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, is with all of you. Truly.
