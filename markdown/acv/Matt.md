# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. A book of a genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

2. Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,

3. and Judah begot Perez and Zerah from Tamar, and Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram,

4. and Ram begot Amminadab, and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,

5. and Salmon begot Boaz from Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed from Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse,

6. and Jesse begot David the king. And David begot Solomon from the widow of Uriah,

7. and Solomon begot Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa,

8. and Asa begot Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah,

9. and Uzziah begot Jotham, and Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah,

10. and Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah,

11. and Josiah begot Jechoniah and his brothers during the Babylonian exile.

12. And after the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel,

13. and Zerubbabel begot Abiud, and Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor,

14. and Azor begot Zadoc, and Zadoc begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud,

15. and Eliud begot Eleazar, and Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob,

16. and Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

17. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the Babylonian exile fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian exile to the Christ fourteen generations.

18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was this way. For his mother Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found having in her womb from Holy Spirit.

19. But Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not wanting to expose her to public disgrace, intended to dismiss her privately.

20. But while he considered these things, behold, an agent of Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take Mary to be thy wife, for that which was begotten in her is from Holy Spirit.

21. And she will bring forth a son, and thou shall call his name JESUS, for he will save his people from their sins.

22. Now all this has come to pass, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,

23. Behold, the virgin will have in her womb, and will bring forth a son. And they will call his name Immanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.

24. And Joseph, being roused from his sleep, did as the agent of Lord ordered him. And he took his wife,

25. and knew her not until she brought forth her son, the firstborn. And he called his name JESUS.

## Matthew 2

1. Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,

2. Where is he who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.

3. And Herod the king having heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

4. And having gathered together all the chief priests and scholars of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ is born.

5. And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea. For thus it is written through the prophet,

6. And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way least among the rulers of Judah, for out of thee will come forth a man who rules, who will tend my people Israel.

7. Then Herod having called the wise men privately, ascertained from them what time the star appeared.

8. And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, After going, search diligently about the child. And when ye find him, report to me, so that I also having come, may worship him.

9. And when they heard the king, they departed. And lo, the star that they saw in the east went before them until, having come, it stood over where the child was.

10. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

11. And having come into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down, they worshiped him. And having opened their treasures, they brought to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

12. And divinely warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.

13. Now after they departed, behold, an agent of Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, After rising, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and thou be there until I tell thee, for Herod is going to seek the child to

14. And having awaken, he took the child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.

15. And he was there until the end of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, Out of Egypt I called my Son.

16. Then Herod, when he saw that he was scorned by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and having sent forth, he killed all the boys in Bethlehem, and in all the borders of it, from two years old and under, according to the time that

17. Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, which says,

18. A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children. And she did not want to be comforted, because they are not.

19. But when Herod perished, behold, an agent of Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,

20. After rising, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those seeking the child's life have died.

21. And having awaken, he took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

22. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee.

23. And having come, he dwelt in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he will be called a Nazarene.

## Matthew 3

1. And in those days John the immerser comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying,

2. Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens has approached.

3. For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of a man crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of Lord. Make his paths straight.

4. Now John himself had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather belt about his waist. And his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region of the Jordan went out to him,

6. and they were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, Ye offspring of vipers, who showed you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance.

9. And think not to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

10. And even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.

11. I indeed immerse you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He will immerse you in a Holy Spirit.

12. Whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. And he will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.

13. Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be immersed by him.

14. But John was preventing him, saying, I have need to be immersed by thee, and thou come to me?

15. But having answered, Jesus said to him, Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allows him.

16. And when Jesus was immersed, he went up straightaway out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.

17. And lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

## Matthew 4

1. Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

2. And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward he was hungry.

3. And after he who tempts came, he said to him, If thou are the Son of God, speak so that these stones may become bread.

4. But having answered, he said, It is written, Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word coming out through the mouth of God.

5. Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and stands him on the pinnacle of the temple.

6. And he says to him, If thou are the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He will command his agents about thee, and, They will take thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

7. Jesus said to him, Again it is written, Thou shall not challenge Lord thy God.

8. Again, the devil takes him onto an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.

9. And he says to him, All these things I give thee, if after falling down, thou will worship me.

10. Then Jesus says to him, Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, Thou shall worship Lord thy God, and him only thou shall serve.

11. Then the devil leaves him, and behold, heavenly agents came and served him.

12. Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee.

13. And having left Nazareth behind, after coming, he dwelt in Capernaum by the sea in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,

14. so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,

15. The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,

16. the people who dwell in darkness saw a great light, and to those who dwell in the region and shadow of death, light sprang up to them.

17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens has approached.

18. And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

19. And he says to them, Come behind me, and I will make you fishermen of men.

20. And straightaway having left the nets, they followed him.

21. And having gone on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them.

22. And straightaway having left the boat and their father, they followed him.

23. And Jesus went around all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good-news of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

24. And his fame went forth into all Syria. And they brought to him all those faring badly with various diseases, and gripped with pain, and being demon-possessed, and being lunatic, and paralyzed. And he healed them.

25. And many multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan followed him.

## Matthew 5

1. And having seen the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. And when he sat down, his disciples came to him.

2. And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,

3. Blessed are the poor in spirit, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.

4. Blessed are those who mourn, because they will be comforted.

5. Blessed are the meek, because they will inherit the earth.

6. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, because they will be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful, because they will obtain mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart, because they will see God.

9. Blessed are the peacemakers, because they will be called sons of God.

10. Blessed are those who have been persecuted because of righteousness, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.

11. Blessed are ye when they revile you, and persecute you, and say every evil word, being deceitful against you because of me.

12. Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, because your reward is great in the heavens, for so they persecuted the prophets before you.

13. Ye are the salt material of the earth. But if the salt material becomes ineffective, by what will it be salted? It is potent for nothing further, except to be cast outside and to be trodden down by men.

14. Ye are the light of the world. A city setting on a hill cannot be hid,

15. nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all in the house.

16. Thus your light should shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in the heavens.

17. Think not that I came to abolish the law or the prophets. I came not to abolish, but to fulfill.

18. For truly I say to you, until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle will, no, not pass away from the law, until all things come to pass.

19. Whoever therefore may relax one of these least commandments, and may teach men so, he will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens. But whoever may do and may teach them, this man will be called great in the kingdom of the he

20. For I say to you, that unless your righteousness abounds more than of the scholars and Pharisees, ye will, no, not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

21. Ye have heard that it was said to them in old times, Thou shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to the judgment.

22. But I say to you, that every man who is angry at his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment, and whoever speaks an insult to his brother will be liable to the council, and whoever says, Foolish man, will be liable to

23. If therefore thou should bring thy gift to the altar, and remember there that thy brother has anything against thee,

24. leave there thy gift before the altar, and go. First be reconciled to thy brother, and then, after coming, bring thy gift.

25. Be agreeing with thine opponent quickly, while thou are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the subordinate, and thou will be cast into prison.

26. Truly I say to thee, thou will, no, not come out from there, until thou have paid the last quadran.

27. Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shall not commit adultery.

28. But I say to you, that every man who looks on a woman to crave her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. And if thy right eye causes thee to stumble, remove it and cast it from thee, for it is advantageous for thee that one of thy body-parts should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.

30. And if thy right hand causes thee to stumble, cut it off and cast it from thee, for it is advantageous for thee that one of thy body-parts should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.

31. And it was said, Whoever may divorce his wife, let him give her a divorce certificate.

32. But I say to you, that whoever may divorce his wife apart from a matter of fornication, disposes her to commit adultery, and whoever may marry her who has been divorced commits adultery.

33. Again, ye have heard that it was said to them in old times, Thou shall not swear falsely, but shall render to the Lord thine oaths.

34. But I say to you, not to swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God,

35. nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.

36. Neither shall thou swear by thy head, because thou cannot make one hair white or black.

37. But let your word be, Yes, yes, No, no. And anything beyond these is from evil.

38. Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

39. But I say to you, not to resist what is troublesome, but whoever will strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.

40. And to the man who wants to sue thee, and take away thy coat, thou shall leave him thy cloak also.

41. And whoever will draft thee for one mile, go thou with him two.

42. Give to him who asks thee, and turn thou not away from him who wants to borrow from thee.

43. Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shall love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.

44. But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,

45. so that ye may become sons of your Father in the heavens, because he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and makes rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

46. For if ye love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the tax collectors the same?

47. And if ye only greet your friends, what do ye extra? Do not even the tax collectors this way?

48. Ye therefore shall be perfect, even as your Father in the heavens is perfect.

## Matthew 6

1. Be careful not to do your charity before men in order to be seen by them, otherwise ye have no reward from your Father in the heavens.

2. When therefore thou do charity, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.

3. But when thou do charity, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does,

4. so that thy charity may be in secret. And thy Father who sees in secret will himself reward thee in the open.

5. And when thou pray, thou shall not be as the hypocrites, because they love to pray having stood in the synagogues and in the corners of the thoroughfares, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.

6. But thou, when thou pray, enter into thy private room, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee in the open.

7. And while praying do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they will be heard by their much speaking.

8. Be not therefore like them, for your Father knows what things ye have need of before ye ask him.

9. Pray ye therefore this way: Our Father in the heavens, hallowed be thy name.

10. May thy kingdom come. May thy will happen on the earth as also in heaven.

11. Give us this day the bread sufficient for us.

12. And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.

13. And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, because from thee is the kingdom and the power and the glory into the ages. Truly.

14. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

15. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

16. And when ye fast, become not like the gloomy looking hypocrites, for they make their faces unsightly, so that they may appear fasting to men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.

17. But when thou fast, anoint thy head, and wash thy face,

18. so that thou may not appear fasting to men, but to thy Father in secret. And thy Father, who sees in secret, will reward thee.

19. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust deteriorates, and where thieves break through and steal,

20. but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust deteriorates, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

22. The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye is sound, thy whole body will be bright.

23. But if thine eye is bad, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness, how great is the darkness!

24. No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or he will hold to one, and disparage the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

25. Because of this I say to you, be not anxious about your life, what ye may eat, or what ye may drink, nor yet for your body, what ye may wear. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the clothing?

26. Look to the birds of the sky, because they sow not, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not more valuable then they?

27. And which man of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?

28. And why are ye anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, nor do they spin,

29. yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.

30. And if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into an oven, will he not much more you, O ye of little faith?

31. Be not therefore anxious, saying, What may we eat? or, What may we drink? or, What may we wear?

32. For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that ye need all these things.

33. But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

34. Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow will be anxious about things of itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil of it.

## Matthew 7

1. Do not criticize, that ye may not be criticized.

2. For by what criticism ye criticize, ye will be criticized, and by what measure ye measure, it will be measured to you.

3. And why do thou see the speck in thy brother's eye, but do not notice the beam in thine own eye?

4. Or how will thou say to thy brother, Let me take out the speck from thine eye, and behold, the beam in thine own eye?

5. Thou hypocrite, first take out the beam from thine own eye, and then thou will see clearly to take out the speck from thy brother's eye.

6. Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, lest they trample them by their feet, and having turn back may lacerate you.

7. Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and ye will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.

8. For every man who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.

9. Or what man is there of you, who, if his son may ask for bread, will give him a stone,

10. and if he may ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?

11. If ye therefore, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children, how much more your Father in the heavens will give good things to those who ask him?

12. All things therefore, as many as ye may want that men should do to you, so also do ye to them, for this is the law and the prophets.

13. Enter ye in by the narrow gate, because wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many are they who enter through it.

14. How narrow is the gate, and restricted the way, that leads to life, and few are those who find it.

15. But beware of FALSE prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are predatory wolves.

16. From their fruits ye will know them. Do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?

17. Likewise every good tree produces good fruits, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruits.

18. A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, nor a corrupt tree produce good fruits.

19. Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.

20. So then from their fruits ye will know them.

21. Not every man who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of my Father in the heavens.

22. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name do many mighty works?

23. And then I will profess to them, I never acknowledged you. Depart from me, ye who work lawlessness.

24. Therefore every man, whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will compare him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock.

25. And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded upon the rock.

26. And every man who hears these sayings of mine, and does not do them, will be compared to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.

27. And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell. And great was the fall of it.

28. And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these sayings, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,

29. for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as their scholars.

## Matthew 8

1. And upon his coming down from the mountain, many multitudes followed him.

2. And behold, a leper who came, worshiped him, saying, Lord, if thou will, thou can cleanse me.

3. And having reached out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying, I will, be thou cleansed. And straightaway his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus says to him, See thou speak to no man, but go, show thyself to the priest, and bring the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to them.

5. And upon his entering into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, beseeching him,

6. and saying, Lord, my boy has been laid down in the house, paralyzed, extremely tormented.

7. And Jesus says to him, after coming I will heal him.

8. And having answered, the centurion said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof, but only speak the word, and my boy will be healed.

9. For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to this man, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it.

10. And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.

11. And I say to you, that many will come from east and west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens,

12. but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go thou. And as thou have believed, be it done to thee. And his boy was healed in that hour.

14. And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law, having been laid down, and feverish.

15. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she was raised up, and served him.

16. And having become evening, they brought to him many being demon possessed. And he cast out the spirits by word, and healed all those faring badly,

17. so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, He himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.

18. Now when Jesus saw many multitudes around him, he commanded to depart to the other side.

19. And a certain scholar having come, he said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou may go.

20. And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky, nests, but the Son of man has nowhere he may lay his head.

21. And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.

22. But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.

23. And upon his entering into the boat, his disciples followed him.

24. And behold, a great tempest developed in the sea, so as for the boat to be covered by the waves, but he was sleeping.

25. And the disciples having approached, they awoke him, saying, Save us, Lord, we are perishing.

26. And he says to them, Why are ye cowardly, O ye of little faith? Then after rising, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there became a great calm.

27. But the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?

28. And upon his coming to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two men being demon possessed met him, coming out of the sepulchers, exceedingly fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.

29. And behold, they cried out, saying, What is with us and thee, Jesus, Son of God? Did thou come here before the time to torment us?

30. Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding.

31. And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of swine.

32. And he said to them, Go. And having come out, they went into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of the swine stampeded down the slope into the sea, and perished in the waters.

33. And those who tended them fled, and having gone into the city, they told everything, also the things of the men being demon possessed.

34. And behold, the whole city came out to a meeting with Jesus. And having seen him, they besought him that he would depart from their regions.

## Matthew 9

1. And after entering into the boat, he passed over, and came into his own city.

2. And behold, they brought to him a paralyzed man who was placed on a bed. And having seen their faith Jesus said to the paralyzed man, Cheer up, child, thy sins have been forgiven thee.

3. And behold, some of the scholars said within themselves, This man blasphemes.

4. And having known their thoughts Jesus said, Why think ye evil in your hearts?

5. For which is easier, to say, Thy sins have been forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?

6. But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins (then he says to the paralyzed man), After rising, take up thy bed, and go to thy house.

7. And after rising, he departed to his house.

8. But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled, and glorified God, who gave such authority to men.

9. And passing forth from there, Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And he says to him, Follow me. And after rising, he followed him.

10. And it came to pass while he relaxed in the house, and behold, many tax collectors and sinners having come, they were sitting with Jesus and his disciples.

11. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?

12. But Jesus having heard it, he said to them, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who fare badly.

13. But after going, learn what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners for repentance.

14. Then the disciples of John come to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but thy disciples fast not?

15. And Jesus said to them, The sons of the wedding hall cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.

16. And no man puts a patch of new cloth upon an old garment, for the patch of it pulls from the garment, and a tear becomes worse.

17. Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins will perish. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.

18. While he spoke these things to them, behold, one ruler who came worshiped him, saying, My daughter has just now perished, but after coming, lay thy hand upon her, and she will live.

19. And having risen, Jesus followed him, also his disciples.

20. And behold, a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, after coming from behind, touched the edge of his garment.

21. For she said within herself, If only I may touch his garment, I will be healed.

22. But having turned around and seen her, Jesus said, Cheer up, daughter, thy faith has healed thee. And the woman was healed from that hour.

23. And Jesus having come into the ruler's house, and having seen the minstrels, and the crowd making a commotion,

24. he says to them, Depart, for the little girl did not die, but sleeps. And they ridiculed him.

25. But when the crowd was put out, having entered in, he took her hand, and the little girl arose.

26. And this report went forth into all that land.

27. And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Be merciful to us, thou son of David.

28. And when he came into the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus says to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yes, Lord.

29. Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith may it happen to you.

30. And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly warned them, saying, See that no man knows it.

31. But having departed, they widely proclaimed him in all that land.

32. And after they departed, behold, they brought to him a mute man possessed with a demon.

33. And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

34. But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of the demons he casts out demons.

35. And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good-news of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

36. But when he saw the multitudes, he felt compassion for them, because they were troubled and dejected, as sheep having no shepherd.

37. Then he says to his disciples, The harvest truly is plentiful, but the workmen are few.

38. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth workmen into his harvest.

## Matthew 10

1. And having called in his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out, and to heal every sickness and every disease.

2. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,

3. Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus who was surnamed Thaddaeus,

4. Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

5. These twelve Jesus sent forth, having ordered them, saying, Go not into a way of the Gentiles, and enter not into a city of the Samaritans,

6. but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And while going, preach, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has come near.

8. Heal those who are feeble, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely ye received, freely give.

9. Acquire no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts,

10. no bag for the road, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor staffs, for the workman is worthy of his provision.

11. And into whatever city or village ye may enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide until ye go forth.

12. And while entering into the house, salute it.

13. And if indeed the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.

14. And whoever will not receive you, nor hear your words, while departing that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet.

15. Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.

16. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Become ye therefore wise as serpents, and innocent as doves.

17. But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues,

18. and ye will be brought to governors and even kings because of me, for a witness to them and to the Gentiles.

19. But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye should speak, for it will be given you in that hour what ye will speak.

20. For ye are not who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking in you.

21. And a brother will deliver up a brother to death, and a father a child. And children will rise up against parents, and condemn them to death.

22. And ye will be hated by all men because of my name, but he who endures to the end, this man will be saved.

23. But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the other, for truly I say to you, ye will, no, not have completed the cities of Israel, until the Son of man comes.

24. A pupil is not above his teacher, nor a bondman above his lord.

25. It is enough for the pupil that he becomes like his teacher, and the bondman like his lord. If they have called the house-ruler Beelzebub, how much more those of his household.

26. Fear them not therefore, for there is nothing covered, that will not be revealed, and hid, that will not be known.

27. What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light, and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops.

28. And be not afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall on the ground independent of your Father.

30. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Fear not therefore, ye are of worth more than many sparrows.

32. Therefore every man, whoever will profess in me before men, I also will profess in him before my Father in the heavens.

33. But whoever would deny me before men, I also will deny him before my Father in the heavens.

34. Think not that I came to spread peace on the earth. I came not to spread peace, but a sword.

35. For I came to divide a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

36. And a man's foes, are those of his own household.

37. He who loves father or mother above me is not worthy of me, and he who loves son or daughter above me is not worthy of me.

38. And he who does not take his cross and follow behind me, is not worthy of me.

39. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life because of me will find it.

40. He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.

41. He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.

42. And whoever may give to drink one of these little ones merely a cold cup in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you he will, no, not lose his reward.

## Matthew 11

1. And it came to pass when Jesus finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.

2. Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, having sent two of his disciples,

3. he said to him, Are thou he who comes, or do we look for another?

4. And having answered, Jesus said to them, After going, report to John the things that ye hear and see:

5. the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor are proclaimed good-news.

6. And blessed is he, whoever will not be caused to stumble by me.

7. And while those men departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes about John, What did ye go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

8. But what did ye go out to see? A man clothed in delicate clothes? Behold, those wearing delicate things are in king's houses.

9. But what did ye go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

10. For this is he about whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face who will prepare thy way before thee.

11. Truly I say to you, among men born of women there has not been raised a greater than John the immerser. Yet the smaller in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.

12. And from the days of John the immerser until now the kingdom of the heavens is treated aggressively, and aggressors seize it.

13. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

14. And if ye are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is going to come.

15. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

16. But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling to their companions,

17. and saying, We piped to you, and ye did not dance, we mourned to you, and ye did not beat the breast.

18. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.

19. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold the man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! And wisdom is justified from her children.

20. Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works occurred, because they did not repent.

21. Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! Because if the mighty works that occurred in you occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.

23. And thou, Capernaum, which was exalted as far as the sky. Thou will be brought down as far as Hades, because if the mighty works had occurred in Sodom that occurred in thee, it would have remained until this day.

24. Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

25. Jesus having responded at that time, said, I extol thee, O Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, because thou hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to the childlike.

26. Yea, Father, because this way it was done pleasing in thy sight.

27. All things were delivered to me by my Father. And no man knows the Son, except the Father, nor does any man know the Father, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son wants to reveal him.

28. Come to me, all ye who labor and have been burdened, and I will give you rest.

29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, because I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye will find rest for your souls.

30. For my yoke is befitting, and my burden is light.

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears, and to eat.

2. But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, Behold, thy disciples do what is not permitted to do upon the Sabbath.

3. But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those with him,

4. how he entered into the house of God, and ate the loaves of the presentation, which was not permitted for him to eat, nor for those with him, except only for the priests?

5. Or have ye not read in the law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?

6. But I say to you, that a greater than the temple is here.

7. But if ye had known what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the innocent.

8. For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.

9. And having departed from there, he went into their synagogue.

10. And behold, there was a man having a withered hand. And they interrogated him, asking if it permitted to heal on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.

11. And he said to them, What man of you will there be, who will have one sheep, and if this falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not grasp it, and lift it out?

12. How much therefore a man is superior to a sheep. So then it is permitted to do good on the Sabbath.

13. Then he says to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole, as the other.

14. But when they went out, the Pharisees held a consultation against him, how they might destroy him.

15. And having known it Jesus withdrew from there, and many multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.

16. And he chided them so that they would not make him known,

17. so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,

18. Behold, my Boy whom I chose, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will declare justice to the Gentiles.

19. He will not quarrel, nor will he shout, nor will any man hear his voice in the thoroughfares.

20. A bruised reed he will not break, and smoldering flax he will not quench, until he sends forth justice for victory.

21. And in his name Gentiles will hope.

22. Then a blind and mute man being demon possessed, was brought to him. And he healed him, so as for the blind and mute man both to speak and to see.

23. And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Is this not the son of David?

24. But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebub the ruler of the demons.

25. And having known their thoughts Jesus said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to ruin, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

26. And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?

27. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they will be your judges.

28. But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come near you.

29. Or how can any man enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.

30. He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.

31. Because of this I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy of the spirit will not be forgiven men.

32. And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in the present age, nor in the one that is coming.

33. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt, for the tree is known by its fruit.

34. Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things.

36. But I say to you, that every idle word, whatever men may speak, they will render account about it in the day of judgment.

37. For from thy words thou will be justified, and from thy words thou will be condemned.

38. Then some of the scholars and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from thee.

39. But having answered, he said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

40. For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea-creature three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.

41. The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

42. The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

43. But when the unclean spirit goes forth out of the man, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and finds it not.

44. Then it says, I will return into my house from where I came out. And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.

45. Then it goes, and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having enter in, they dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will also be to this evil generation.

46. While he was still speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers had stood outside, seeking to speak to him.

47. And some man said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to thee.

48. But having answered, he said to the man who told him, Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?

49. And having stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, he said, Behold, my mother and my brothers.

50. For whoever does the will of my Father in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.

## Matthew 13

1. And on that day, having departed from the house, Jesus was sitting beside the sea.

2. And many multitudes were gathered to him, so as for him (having entered in) to sit in the boat, and all the multitude had stood on the shore.

3. And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the man who sows went forth to sow.

4. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them.

5. But others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much soil, and straightaway they sprang up because they had no depth of soil.

6. But when the sun was risen, they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered.

7. And others fell in the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.

8. But others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

9. He who has ears, let him hear.

10. And the disciples having come, they said to him, Why do thou speak to them in parables?

11. And having answered, he said to them, Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those men it has not been given.

12. For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.

13. Because of this I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, nor do they understand.

14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, By hearing ye will hear, and will, no, not understand, and seeing ye will see, and will, no, not perceive.

15. For this people's heart became fat, and their ears hear heavily, and their eyes are shut, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I will heal them.

16. But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.

17. For truly I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men longed to see the things that ye see, and did not see them, and to hear the things that ye hear, and did not hear them.

18. Hear ye then the parable of the man who sows.

19. Of every man who hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understands it, evil comes, and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is that which was sown by the wayside.

20. And that which was sown upon the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and straightaway receiving it with joy,

21. yet he has no root in himself, instead it is temporary. And when tribulation or persecution develops because of the word, straightaway he is caused to stumble.

22. And that which was sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the care of this age, and the deceitfulness of wealth, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

23. But that which was sown upon the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who indeed bears fruit, and is productive, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

24. He set forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man sowing good seed in his field.

25. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst the wheat, and went away.

26. And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares also appeared.

27. But the bondmen of the house-ruler having come, they said to him, Sir, did thou not sow good seed in thy field? From where then does it have tares?

28. And he said to them, A hostile man did this. And the bondmen said to him, Do thou desire therefore, after going, we would gather them up?

29. But he said, No, lest while gathering up the tares, ye uproot the wheat together with them.

30. Allow both to grow together until the harvest. And at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles in order to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.

31. He set forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard plant, which having taken, a man sowed in his field.

32. Which indeed is smaller than all seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so as for the birds of the sky to come and lodge in the branches of it.

33. He spoke another parable to them. The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened.

34. Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes, and he did not speak to them independent of a parable,

35. so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things concealed from the foundation of the world.

36. Then having sent the multitudes away, Jesus came into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.

37. And having answered, he said to them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man,

38. and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of evil.

39. And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are heavenly agents.

40. As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned in fire, so it will be at the end of this age.

41. The Son of man will send forth his agents, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks, and those doing lawlessness,

42. and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

43. Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

44. Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man having found, he hid. And from the joy of it, he goes and sells all, as many things as he has, and buys that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a merchant, seeking fine pearls.

46. Who, having found one very valuable pearl, after departing, sold all, as many things as he had, and bought it.

47. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered from every kind,

48. which, when it was full, after dragging to the shore, having sat down, they gathered the good into vessels, but they cast out the useless.

49. So it will be at the end of the age. The heavenly agents will come forth, and separate the bad from among the righteous,

50. and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

51. Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yes, Lord.

52. And he said to them, Because of this every scholar who has been instructed in the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a house-ruler, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.

53. And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these parables, he departed from there.

54. And having come into his fatherland he taught them in their synagogue, so as for them to be astonished, and say, From where is this wisdom and powers in this man?

55. Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?

56. And his sisters, are they not all near us? From where then are all these things in this man?

57. And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his fatherland, and in his house.

58. And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report of Jesus,

2. and he said to his boys, This is John the immerser. He has risen from the dead, and because of this the powers work in him.

3. For Herod having arrested John, bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.

4. For John said to him, It is not permitted for thee to have her.

5. And though he wanted to kill him, he feared the multitude because they held him as a prophet.

6. But Herod's birthday being brought, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.

7. Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.

8. And she, having been put forward by her mother, says, Give me here on a platter the head of John the immerser.

9. And he became sad, but because of the oaths, and of those dining together, the king commanded it to be given.

10. And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.

11. And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the maiden, and she brought it to her mother.

12. And after coming, his disciples took up the body and buried it, and having gone, they informed Jesus.

13. Now when Jesus heard it, he departed from there in a boat into a desolate place in private. And when the multitudes heard of it, they followed him on foot from the cities.

14. And having come forth, Jesus saw a great multitude, and he felt compassion toward them, and healed the feeble of them.

15. And having become evening, his disciples came to him, saying, The place is desolate, and the hour is now past. Send the multitudes away, so that having gone into the villages, they may buy food for themselves.

16. But Jesus said to them, They have no need to depart. Give ye them to eat.

17. And they say to him, We have not here, except five loaves and two fishes.

18. But he said, Bring them here to me.

19. And after commanding the multitudes to sit down on the grass, having taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, having looking up to heaven, he blessed. And having broken them in pieces, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the

20. And they all ate, and were filled. And they took up that which remained of the fragments, twelve baskets full.

21. And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

22. And straightaway Jesus compelled the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, until he would dismiss the multitudes.

23. And having dismissed the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain in private to pray. And having become evening, he was there alone.

24. But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, being buffeted by the waves, for the wind was contrary.

25. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking upon the sea.

26. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost, and they cried out from fear.

27. But straightaway Jesus spoke to them, saying, Cheer up. It is I, fear not.

28. And having answered him, Peter said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the waters.

29. And he said, Come. And having come down from the boat, Peter walked upon the water to go to Jesus.

30. But seeing the boisterous wind, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.

31. And straightaway having stretched forth his hand, Jesus took hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why did thou doubt?

32. And when they entered into the boat, the wind ceased.

33. And those who came in the boat worshiped him, saying, Thou really are the Son of God.

34. And when they crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.

35. And when they recognized him, the men of that place sent into that whole region round about, and brought to him all those faring badly.

36. And they besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment. And as many as touched were healed.

## Matthew 15

1. Then scholars and Pharisees from Jerusalem come to Jesus, saying,

2. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.

3. And having answered, he said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, because of your tradition?

4. For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and thy mother, and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him perish in death.

5. But ye say, Whoever may say to the father or the mother, Whatever thou might have benefited from me is an offering.

6. And he will, no, not honor his father or mother. And ye have annulled the command of God because of your tradition.

7. Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying,

8. This people comes near me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far distant from me.

9. And in vain they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.

10. And having called in the multitude, he said to them, Hear and understand.

11. Not that which enters into the mouth defiles the man, but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.

12. Then having come near, his disciples said to him, Know thou that the Pharisees were offended when they heard the saying?

13. But having answered, he said, Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant, will be uprooted.

14. Leave them. They are blind leaders of blind men, and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a ditch.

15. And having answered, Peter said to him, Explain this parable to us.

16. And Jesus said, Are ye also still without understanding?

17. Do ye not yet understand, that everything entering into the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into a toilet?

18. But the things coming out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and those things defile the man.

19. For from the heart comes forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, FALSE witnessings, revilings.

20. These are things defiling the man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.

21. And having gone out from there, Jesus departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And behold, a Canaanite woman having come out from those regions, cried out to him, saying, Be merciful to me, O Lord, thou son of David, my daughter is grievously demon-possessed.

23. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples having approached, they besought him, saying, Send her away, because she cries out behind us.

24. But having answered, he said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. But having come, she worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.

26. And having answered, he said, It is not right to take the children's bread and cast it to the house dogs.

27. But she said, Yes, Lord, for even the house dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.

28. Then Jesus having answered, said to her, O woman, great is thy faith. Be it done for thee as thou desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour.

29. And having departed from there, Jesus came near the sea of Galilee. And having gone up onto the mountain, he sat there.

30. And many multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, crippled, and many others. And they placed them beside Jesus' feet, and he healed them,

31. so as for the multitudes to marvel seeing the mute speaking, the maimed healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.

32. And Jesus having summoned his disciples, he said, I feel compassion toward the multitude because they continue with me now three days and do not have what they might eat. And I do not want to dismiss them without food, lest they mi

33. And his disciples say to him, From where are so many loaves for us in a wilderness so as to feed so great a multitude?

34. And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.

35. And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the ground.

36. And after taking the seven loaves and the fishes, having expressed thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

37. And they all ate and were filled. And they took up seven hampers full of the fragments that remained.

38. And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.

39. And having dismissed the multitudes, he entered into the boat, and came into the regions of Magdala.

## Matthew 16

1. And the Pharisees and Sadducees who came, testing, demanded him to exhibit to them a sign from the sky.

2. But having answered, he said to them, When it becomes evening, ye say, Fair weather, for the sky is red.

3. And at morning, Bad weather today, for the sky is red, being gloomy. Hypocrites! Ye indeed know how to discern the face of the sky, but the signs of the times ye are not able.

4. An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. And having left them behind, he departed.

5. And his disciples having come to the other side, they forgot to take loaves.

6. And Jesus said to them, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

7. And they deliberated among themselves, saying, We took no loaves.

8. And having known it, Jesus said to them, O ye of little faith, why do ye deliberate among yourselves because ye brought no loaves?

9. Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up,

10. nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many hampers ye took up?

11. How do ye not understand that I spoke to you not about bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?

12. Then they understood that he said not to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13. Now when Jesus came into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say I, the Son of man, am?

14. And they said, Some, John the immerser, others, Elijah, but others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. He says to them, But who say ye, I am?

16. And Simon Peter having answered, said, Thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

17. And having answered, Jesus said to him, Blessed are thou, Simon Bar-jonah, because flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father in the heavens.

18. And I also say to thee, that thou are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.

19. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever thou may bind on earth will be what is bound in the heavens, and whatever thou may loose on the earth will be what is loosed in the heavens.

20. Then he commanded his disciples that they should tell no man that he is Jesus, the Christ.

21. From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scholars, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.

22. And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him, saying, Be merciful to thee, Lord. This will, no, not be to thee.

23. But having turned around, he said to Peter, Go thee behind me, Satan. Thou are my stumbling-block, because thou regard not the things of God, but the things of men.

24. Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any man wants to come behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

25. For whoever wants save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.

26. For what does it profit a men, if he should gain the whole world, and lose his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

27. For the Son of man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his heavenly agents, and then he will reward each man according to his actions.

28. Truly I say to you, there are some of those who stand here, who will, no, not taste of death, until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

## Matthew 17

1. And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up onto a high mountain in private.

2. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.

3. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.

4. And having responded, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou desire, we could make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

5. While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him.

6. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were exceedingly afraid.

7. And having come, Jesus touched them and said, Arise, and fear not.

8. And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, except Jesus only.

9. And while they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man will rise from the dead.

10. And his disciples questioned him, saying, Why then do the scholars say that Elijah must first come?

11. And having answered, Jesus said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all.

12. But I say to you, that Elijah already came, and they knew him not, but did to him how many things they wanted. Likewise also the Son of man is going to suffer by them.

13. Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them about John the immerser.

14. And when they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling to him, and saying,

15. Lord, be merciful to my son, because he is lunatic, and suffers badly. For he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.

17. And having answered, Jesus said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him here to me.

18. And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon departed from him. And the boy was cured from that hour.

19. Then the disciples having come to Jesus in private, said, Why could we not cast it out?

20. And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For truly I say to you, if ye have faith as a grain of a mustard plant, ye will say to this mountain, Remove from here to there, and it will depart, and nothing will be impossible t

21. But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.

22. And while they turned back in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men,

23. and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorry.

24. And when they came to Capernaum, those who receive the double-drachma came to Peter, and said, Does not your teacher pay the double-drachma?

25. He says, Yes. And when he entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What think thou, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they take taxes or tribute, from their sons or from strangers?

26. And Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Therefore the sons are free.

27. But, so that we might not offend them, after going to the sea, cast a hook. And take up the first fish coming up, and having opened its mouth, thou will find a four-drachma coin. After taking that, give thou to them for me and thee

## Matthew 18

1. In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of the heavens?

2. And having called in a child, Jesus set it in the midst of them.

3. And he said, Truly I say to you, if ye are not turned, and become as children, ye will, no, not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

4. He therefore who will make himself lowly as this child, this man is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens.

5. And whoever will receive one such child in my name receives me.

6. But whoever may cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is advantageous for him that a donkey-powered millstone were hanged on his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

7. Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks. For it is necessary that the stumbling-blocks come, yet woe to that man through whom the stumbling-block comes.

8. And if thy hand or thy foot causes thee to stumble, cut them off and cast from thee. It is good for thee to enter into life crippled or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.

9. And if thine eye causes thee to stumble, remove it and cast it from thee. It is good for thee to enter into life one-eyed, than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.

10. See that ye not disparage one of these little ones, for I say to you, that in the heavens their agents do always behold the face of my Father in the heavens.

11. For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.

12. What does it seem to you? If it happens a hundred sheep are with some man, and one of them went astray, after going (having left the ninety-nine on the mountains), does he not seek the one going astray?

13. And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you, that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.

14. So, it is not a purpose before your Father in the heavens, that one of these little ones should perish.

15. But if thy brother should sin against thee, go and reprove him between thee and him alone. If he should hear thee, thou have gained thy brother.

16. But if he should not hear, take with thee one or two besides, so that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.

17. And if he is heedless of them, speak to the church. But if he is also heedless of the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and the tax collector.

18. Truly I say to you, however many things ye may bind on the earth will be things that are bound in heaven, and however many things ye may loose on the earth will be things that that are loosed in heaven.

19. Again I say to you truly, that if two of you should agree on the earth concerning every matter, whatever they might ask, it will happen for them from my Father in the heavens.

20. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

21. Then Peter having come to him, he said, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?

22. Jesus says to him, I say to thee, not until seven times, but until seventy times seven.

23. Because of this the kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a king, who wanted to settle account with his bondmen.

24. And when he began to settle, one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him.

25. But of him not having to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all things, as many as he had, and payment to be made.

26. The bondman therefore having fallen down, worshiped him, saying, Lord, be patient toward me and I will pay thee all.

27. And having felt compassion, the lord of that bondman released him, and forgave him the debt.

28. But after going out, that bondman found one of his fellow bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii. And having grabbed him, he choked him, saying, Pay me if thou owe anything.

29. So his fellow bondman having fallen down at his feet, besought him, saying, Be patience toward me, and I will pay thee.

30. But he would not, instead, having left him, he cast him into prison until he would pay that which was owed.

31. And when his fellow bondmen saw the things that happened, they were extremely sorry. And after coming, they reported to their lord all the things that happened.

32. Then his lord having summoned him, he says to him, Thou evil bondman, I forgave thee all that debt because thou besought me.

33. Was it not necessary for thee also to be merciful to thy fellow bondman, as I also was merciful to thee?

34. And having become angry, his lord delivered him to the tormentors until he would pay all that was due to him.

35. So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if ye do not forgive each man his brother, from your hearts, their trespasses.

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee and came into the regions of Judea beyond the Jordan.

2. And many multitudes followed him and he healed them there.

3. And Pharisees came to him, trying him, and saying to him, Is it permitted for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?

4. And having answered, he said to them, Have ye not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,

5. and said, For this reason a man will leave his father and mother behind, and will be bonded with his wife, and the two will be in one flesh?

6. So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, no man shall separate.

7. They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorcement, and to divorce her?

8. He says to them, For your hard heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it did not happened this way.

9. And I say to you, that whoever may divorce his wife, not for fornication, and will marry another, commits adultery. And he who married her who has been divorced commits adultery.

10. His disciples say to him, If the case of the man with his wife is this way, it is not advantageous to marry.

11. But he said to them, Not all men can accommodate this saying, but to whom it has been given.

12. For there are eunuchs who were born this way from their mother's belly, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who is able to

13. Then children were brought to him, so that he would lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.

14. But Jesus said, Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for of such kind is the kingdom of the heavens.

15. And having laid his hands on them, he departed from there.

16. And behold one man having come to him, said, Good teacher, what good thing should I do so that I may have eternal life?

17. And he said to him, Why do thou call me good? There is none good except one, God. But if thou want to enter into life, keep the commandments.

18. He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not testify falsely.

19. Honor the father and mother, and, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.

20. The young man says to him, All these things I have kept from my youthfulness. What do I lack yet?

21. Jesus said to him, If thou want to be perfect, go, sell the things being possessed by thee, and give to the poor, and thou will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.

22. But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowing, for he was having many possessions.

23. And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, that a rich man will enter into the kingdom of the heavens difficultly.

24. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the hole of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

25. And when his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?

26. And having looked, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

27. Then having answered, Peter said to him, Lo, we have forsaken all, and followed thee. What then will be for us?

28. And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man will sit on the throne of his glory, ye also will sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And every man who has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, because of my name, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.

30. But many first will be last, and last, first.

## Matthew 20

1. For the kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a house-ruler, who went out in the early morning at the same time to hire workmen for his vineyard.

2. And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others having stood idle in the marketplace.

4. And he said to those men, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever would be right I will give you, and they went.

5. Again having gone out about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did likewise.

6. And having gone out about the eleventh hour, he found others who have stood idle. And he says to them, Why have ye stood here idle the whole day?

7. They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever would be right ye will receive.

8. And having become evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his manager, Call the workmen, and render to them their wage, having begun from the last until the first.

9. And those who came about the eleventh hour, each received a denarius.

10. But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they also received a denarius each.

11. And when they received it, they murmured against the house-ruler,

12. saying, These last did one hour, and thou have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.

13. But having answered, he said to one of them, Friend, I do not wrong thee. Did thou not agree with me for a denarius?

14. Take thine and go. But I want to give to this last man, as to thee also.

15. Is it not permitted for me to do what I want with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?

16. So the last will be first, and the first last, for many are called but few chosen.

17. And while going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples in private on the way, and he said to them,

18. Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scholars. And they will condemn him to death,

19. and will deliver him to the Gentiles to ridicule, and to scourge, and to crucify. And the third day he will rise.

20. Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, worshiping, and asking something from him.

21. And he said to her, What do thou want? She says to him, Speak that these my two sons may sit, one at thy right hand and one at thy left hand in thy kingdom.

22. But having answered, Jesus said, Ye know not what ye are asking. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am going to drink, or to be immersed the immersion that I am immersed? They say to him, We are able.

23. And he says to them, Ye will indeed drink my cup, and ye will be immersed the immersion that I am immersed. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared by my Father.

24. And when the ten heard it, they were indignant about the two brothers.

25. But having summoned them, Jesus said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord over them, and their eminent men have power over them.

26. But it shall not be so among you. Rather whoever wants to become great among you, he shall be your helper,

27. and whoever wants be first among you shall be your bondman.

28. Just as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.

29. And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.

30. And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, having heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Be merciful to us, Lord, thou son of David.

31. And the multitude rebuked them, so that they would be quiet, but they cried out greater, saying, Be merciful to us, Lord, thou son of David.

32. And having stood still, Jesus called them and said, What do ye want that I would do to you?

33. They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

34. And having felt compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and straightaway they received their sight, and followed him.

## Matthew 21

1. And when they came near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,

2. saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and straightaway ye will find a donkey tied, and a colt with it. Having loosed them, bring to me.

3. And if any man says anything to you, ye will say, The Lord has need of them, and straightaway he will send them.

4. Now all this came to pass, so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,

5. Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King comes to thee, meek, and mounted upon a donkey, and a colt the foal of a pack animal.

6. And the disciples having gone, and having done as Jesus commanded them,

7. they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their garments over them. And he sat upon them.

8. And the great multitide spread their garments on the road, and others cut down branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.

9. And the multitudes who went ahead and those who followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Lord. Hosanna in the highest!

10. And when he entered into Jerusalem, all the city was shaken, saying, Who is this?

11. And the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.

12. And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple. And he overturned the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.

13. And he says to them, It is written, My house will be called a house of prayer, but ye made it a den of robbers.

14. And the lame and the blind came to him in the temple, and he healed them.

15. But when the chief priests and the scholars saw the wonderful things that he did, and the boys crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David, they were indignant,

16. and said to him, Do thou hear what these are saying? And Jesus says to them, Yes! Did ye never read, Out of the mouth of children and those who suckle thou have perfected praise?

17. And having left them behind, he went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.

18. Now early while returning to the city, he was hungry.

19. And having seen a fig tree, one on the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, except leaves only. And he says to it, Let fruit no longer be produced from thee into the age. And immediately the fig tree dried out.

20. And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree dry out immediately?

21. And having answered, Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, if ye have faith, and doubt not, ye will not only do that of the fig tree, but even if ye may say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen

22. And all things, as many as ye may ask in prayer, believing, ye will receive.

23. And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him while he taught, saying, By what authority do thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?

24. And having answered, Jesus said to them, I also will ask you one word, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.

25. The immersion of John, from where was it, from heaven or from men? And they deliberated with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?

26. But if we should say, From men, we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.

27. And having answered Jesus, they said, We know not. He said to them, And neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

28. But what does it seem to you? A man had two children. And having come to the first, he said, Child, go work today in my vineyard.

29. And having answered, he said, I do not want to, but having repented later, he went.

30. And having come to the second, he said likewise. And having answered, he said, I, sir, and did not go.

31. Which of the two did the will of the father? They say to him, The first. Jesus says to them, Truly I say to you, that the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

32. For John came to you in a way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And having seen it, ye did not repent afterward to believe him.

33. Hear ye another parable. There was a certain man who was a house-ruler, who planted a vineyard, and placed a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and leased it to farmers, and went on a journey.

34. And when the time of the fruits approached, he sent his bondmen to the farmers to receive his fruits.

35. And the farmers having taken his bondmen, they beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

36. Again, he sent other bondmen more than the first, and they did to them in like manner.

37. But finally he sent to them his son, saying, They will be made ashamed by my son.

38. But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and possess his inheritance.

39. And having seized him, they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

40. When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?

41. They say to him, Evil men, he will miserably destroy them, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.

42. Jesus says to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone that those who build rejected, this came to be in the head of the corner. This happened from Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?

43. Because of this I say to you, that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.

44. And he who falls on this stone will be shattered, but on whomever it may fall, it will grind him to dust.

45. And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he spoke about them.

46. And when they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him as a prophet.

## Matthew 22

1. And having responded, Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying,

2. The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a king who made a wedding for his son.

3. And he sent forth his bondmen to call those who were invited to the wedding festivities, and they did not want to come.

4. Again he sent forth other bondmen, saying, Speak to those who were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and my fatlings have been killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding festivities.

5. But having disregarded, they departed, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,

6. and the others having seized his bondmen, abused and killed them.

7. But having heard that, the king was angry, and having sent forth his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.

8. Then he says to his bondmen, The wedding is indeed ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.

9. Go ye therefore to the crossings of the ways, and as many as ye may find, call to the wedding festivities.

10. And those bondmen having departed into the roads, they gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good. And the wedding was filled with those who were dining.

11. But when the king came in to see those who were dining, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment.

12. And he says to him, Friend, how did thou come in here not having a wedding garment? But he was speechless.

13. Then the king said to the helpers, After binding him hands and feet, take him away and cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

14. For many are called, but few chosen.

15. Then the Pharisees having departed, they took counsel how they might trap him in his talk.

16. And they send out their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and it is not a concern to thee about a man, for thou look not to the personage of men.

17. Tell us therefore, what does it seem to thee? Is it permitted to give tribute to Caesar or not?

18. But Jesus having known their wickedness, said, Why do ye tempt me, ye hypocrites?

19. Exhibit to me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denarius.

20. And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription?

21. They say to him, Caesar's. Then he says to them, Therefore, render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.

22. And when they heard it, they marveled. And having left him, they departed.

23. On that day Sadducees came to him, those who claim to be no resurrection. And they questioned him, saying,

24. Teacher, Moses said, If some man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.

25. Now there were with us seven brothers. And the first having married perished. And having no seed left his wife to his brother.

26. Likewise also the second, and the third, until the seventh.

27. And last of all, the woman also died.

28. In the resurrection therefore, which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.

29. But having answered, Jesus said to them, Ye are led astray, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

30. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as agents of God in heaven.

31. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,

32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not God of the dead, but of the living.

33. And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his doctrine.

34. But the Pharisees, having heard that he silenced the Sadducees, they came together in the same place.

35. And one of them, a lawyer, questioned, trying him, and saying,

36. Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?

37. And Jesus said to him, Thou shall love Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.

38. This is the first and great commandment.

39. And the second is like it, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.

40. On these two commandments hang all the law, and the prophets.

41. Now the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus interrogated them, saying,

42. What does it seem to you about the Christ? Whose son is he? They say to him, Of David.

43. He says to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,

44. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet?

45. If David therefore calls him Lord, how is he his son?

46. And no man was able to answer him a word, nor did any man from that day dare to question him any more.

## Matthew 23

1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples, saying,

2. The scholars and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat.

3. All things therefore, however many they may tell you to observe, observe and do, but do not ye according to their works, for they say, and do not.

4. For they bind heavy burdens and difficult to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they do not want to move them with their finger.

5. But all their works they do in order to be seen by men. And they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the hems of their garments.

6. And they love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,

7. and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be designated by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

8. But be ye not designated Rabbi, for one is your leader, the Christ, and ye are all brothers.

9. And do not designate a father of you upon the earth, for one is your Father, he in the heavens.

10. And be ye not designated leaders, for one is your leader, the Christ.

11. But the greater of you will be your helper.

12. And he who will exalt himself will be made low, and he who will make himself low will be exalted.

13. Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye close up the kingdom of the heavens ahead of men. For ye enter not in, nor do ye allow those who are entering to enter in.

14. But woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye devour widows' houses, and praying long in pretence. Because of this ye will receive greater condemnation.

15. Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye encompass the sea and the land to make one proselyte, and when it happens, ye make him twice more a son of hell than yourselves.

16. Woe to you, ye blind guides, who say, Whoever may swear by the temple, it is nothing, but whoever may swear by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.

17. Ye foolish and blind men, for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?

18. And, Whoever may swear by the altar, it is nothing, but whoever may swear by the gift upon it, he is obligated.

19. Ye foolish and blind men, for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

20. He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all things on it.

21. And he who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who dwells in it.

22. And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits upon it.

23. Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye tithe the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law--justice and mercy and faith. These things must be done, and not neglecting t

24. Ye blind guides, who strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel.

25. Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but inside they are full of plunder and unrighteousness.

26. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, so that the outside of them may also become clean.

27. Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.

28. In this way also, ye indeed outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside ye are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

29. Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchers of the righteous,

30. and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

31. So then ye testify to yourselves that ye are sons of those who murdered the prophets.

32. Then fill ye up the measure of your fathers.

33. Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how will ye escape from the damnation of hell?

34. Because of this, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scholars. And some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and will persecute from city to city,

35. so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.

36. Truly I say to you, that all these things will come upon this generation.

37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who have been sent to her. How often I wanted to gathered thy children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and ye would not.

38. Behold, your house is left to you desolate.

39. For I say to you, ye will, no, not see me henceforth, until ye say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of Lord.

## Matthew 24

1. And when Jesus departed he was going from the temple. And his disciples came near to exhibit to him the buildings of the temple.

2. But Jesus said to them, Do ye not see all these things? Truly I say to you, there will be left here, no, not a stone upon a stone, that will not be thrown down.

3. And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And what is the sign of thy coming, and of the termination of the age?

4. And having answered, Jesus said to them, See that not any man may lead you astray.

5. For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will lead many astray.

6. And ye are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that ye not be alarmed, for all the things must happen, but the end is not yet.

7. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes in places.

8. But all these things are the beginning of travail.

9. Then they will deliver you up for tribulation, and will kill you, and ye will be hated by all the nations because of my name.

10. And then many will be caused to stumble, and they will betray each other and will hate each other.

11. And many FALSE prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.

12. And because of the increased lawlessness, the love of the many will become cold.

13. But he who endures to the end, this man will be saved.

14. And this good-news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.

15. When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand),

16. then let those in Judea flee to the mountains.

17. Let the man on the housetop not go down to take things from his house.

18. And let the man in the field not return back to take his clothes.

19. And woe to those who have in the womb and to those who suckle in those days.

20. And pray ye that your flight may not happen in winter, nor on a Sabbath,

21. for then there will be great tribulation, such as not has happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor, no, it will not happen.

22. And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved. But because of the chosen those days will be shortened.

23. Then if any man should say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here, believe ye not.

24. For there will arise FALSE Christs and FALSE prophets, and they will give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.

25. Behold, I have foretold it to you.

26. If therefore they should say to you, Behold, he is in the wilderness, do not go forth. Behold, he is in the inner chambers, do not believe.

27. For as the lightning comes out from the east, and shines as far as the west, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.

28. For wherever the carcass may be, there the vultures will be gathered together.

29. But straightaway after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. And the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

30. And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in the sky. And then all the tribes of the earth will beat the breast, and they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds of the sky with power and much glory.

31. And he will send forth his agents with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the boundaries of the heavens--as far as their boundaries.

32. Now learn a parable from the fig tree. When its branch now becomes tender, and sprouts leaves, ye know that the summer is near.

33. So ye also, when ye see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.

34. Truly I say to you, this generation will, no, not pass away, until all these things happen.

35. The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words may, no, not pass away.

36. But about that day and hour no man knows, not even the agents of the heavens, except my Father only.

37. And as the days of Noah, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.

38. For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until that day Noah entered into the ark.

39. And they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away. So also will be the coming of the Son of man.

40. Then two men will be in the field, one is taken, and one is left.

41. Two women grinding at the mill, one is taken, and one is left.

42. Watch therefore, because ye know not at what hour your Lord comes.

43. But know this, that if the house-ruler had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

44. Because of this ye also be ready, because in that hour ye think not the Son of man comes.

45. Who then is the faithful and wise bondman, whom his lord appointed over his service, to give them the provision on time?

46. Blessed is that bondman, whom his lord when he comes will find so doing.

47. Truly I say to you, that he will appoint him over all things being possessed by him.

48. But if that evil bondman should say in his heart, My lord is late coming,

49. and should begin to beat the fellow bondmen, and to eat and drink with the drunken,

50. the lord of that bondman will come in a day that he does not expect, and in an hour that he is not aware,

51. and he will cut him in two, and place his share with the hypocrites. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

## Matthew 25

1. Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who, having taken their lamps, went forth to the bridegroom's gathering.

2. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish,

3. foolish women, who, having taken their lamps, took no olive oil with them.

4. But the wise took olive oil in their vessels with their lamps.

5. Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.

6. But at midnight a shout occurred, Behold, the bridegroom comes! Go ye forth for his gathering.

7. Then all those virgins were roused, and put their lamps in order.

8. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us from your olive oil, because our lamps are going out.

9. But the wise answered, saying, Perhaps there may not be enough for us and you. But go ye rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.

10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. And the prepared entered in with him for the wedding festivities, and the door was shut.

11. But afterward the other virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

12. But having answered, he said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.

13. Watch therefore, because ye know not the day nor the hour in which the son of man comes.

14. For, like a man going on a journey, he called his own bondmen, and delivered to them the things possessed by him.

15. And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his personal ability, and straightaway he journeyed.

16. And having departed, the man who received the five talents worked with them, and made five other talents.

17. And likewise also the man of the two gained two others.

18. But having departed, the man who received the one dug in the ground, and hid his lord's silver.

19. Now after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes, and takes up accounting with them.

20. And having come, the man who received the five talents brought five other talents, saying, Lord, thou delivered five talents to me, lo, I have gained five other talents besides them.

21. And his lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman. Thou were faithful over a few things, I will appoint thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

22. And also having come, the man who received the two talents said, Lord, thou delivered two talents to me, lo, I have gained two other talents besides them.

23. His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman. Thou were faithful over a few things, I will appoint thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

24. And the man who received the one talent also having come, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou are a hard man, reaping where thou did not sow, and gathering from where thou did not scatter.

25. And after being afraid, having gone, I hid thy talent in the ground. Lo, thou have thine own.

26. But having answered, his lord said to him, Thou evil and lazy bondman, thou knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather from where I did not scatter.

27. Thou ought therefore to have placed my silver with the bankers, and having come I would have received back my own with interest.

28. Take ye therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.

29. For to every man who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.

30. And cast ye the unprofitable bondman into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

31. But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the holy agents with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.

32. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from each other, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

33. And he will truly place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.

34. Then the King will say to those at his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

35. For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink. I was a stranger, and ye took me in,

36. naked, and ye clothed me. I was feeble, and ye came to help me. I was in prison, and ye came to me.

37. Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, and fed thee, or thirsting, and gave thee drink?

38. And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in, or naked, and clothed thee?

39. And when did we see thee weak, or in prison, and came to thee?

40. And having answered, the King will say to them, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it to one of these my brothers, the least, ye did it to me.

41. Then he will also say to those at the left hand, Depart from me, ye accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his agents.

42. For I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat, I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink,

43. I was a stranger, and ye did not take me in, naked, and ye did not clothe me, weak, and in prison, and ye did not come to help me.

44. Then they will also answer, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or weak, or in prison, and did not serve thee?

45. Then he will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these least, ye did it not to me.

46. And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.

## Matthew 26

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these saying, he said to his disciples,

2. Ye know that after two days the Passover comes, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

3. Then the chief priests, and the scholars, and the elders of the people, assembled together to the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,

4. and they deliberated so that they might take Jesus by trickery, and kill him.

5. But they said, Not during the feast, lest an uproar develop among people.

6. Now when Jesus happened to be in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. a woman came to him having an alabaster cruse of precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head as he sat relaxing.

8. But when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?

9. For this ointment could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

10. But Jesus knowing it, he said to them, Why do ye cause troubles to the woman? For she has wrought a good work upon me.

11. For ye always have the poor with you, but ye do not always have me.

12. For by pouring this ointment upon my body, she did it for my burial.

13. Truly I say to you, wherever this good-news may be proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman did will also be told for a memorial of her.

14. Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, having gone to the chief priests,

15. he said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty silver pieces.

16. And from that time he sought a favorable opportunity so that he might betray him.

17. Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do thou want that we should prepare for thee to eat the Passover?

18. And he said, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The teacher says, My time is near. I keep the Passover with my disciples with thee.

19. And the disciples did as Jesus arranged for them, and they prepared the Passover.

20. Now having become evening, he was sitting with the twelve.

21. And as they were eating, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.

22. And being exceedingly sorrowful, they began, each of them, to say to him, Is it I, Lord?

23. And having answered, he said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, this man will betray me.

24. The Son of man indeed goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for him if that man had not been born.

25. And Judas (the man who betrayed him) having answered, he said, Is it I, Rabbi? He says to him, Thou have said.

26. And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread, having expressed thanks, broke in pieces, and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body.

27. And having taken the cup, having expressed thanks, he gave to them, saying, All ye drink of it,

28. for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed on behalf of many for remission of sins.

29. But I say to you, that I will, no, not drink of this fruit of the grapevine henceforth until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

30. And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.

31. Then Jesus says to them, All ye will be caused to stumble by me in this night, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.

32. But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. But having answered, Peter said to him, If all men will be caused to stumble by thee, I will never be caused to stumble.

34. Jesus said to him, Truly I say to thee, that in this night, before a cock sounds, thou will deny me thrice.

35. Peter says to him, Even if I must die with thee, I will, no, not deny thee. And likewise also, said all the disciples.

36. Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, Sit ye here until, after going, I may pray there.

37. And having taken Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and distressed.

38. Then Jesus says to them, My soul is deeply grieved, as far as of death. Remain ye here and watch with me.

39. And having gone forward a little, he fell on his face praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, may this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I want, but as thou.

40. And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, So ye could not watch with me one hour.

41. Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation. Truly, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

42. Having gone again a second time, he prayed, saying, My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me, except I drink it, may thy will happen.

43. And having come again, he finds them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

44. And when he left them, having gone away again, he prayed a third time, saying again the same statement.

45. Then he comes to his disciples, and says to them, Sleep what remains, and take rest...Behold, the hour has come near, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

46. Awake, we go. Behold, he who betrays me has come near.

47. And while he was still speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priest and elders of the people.

48. Now the man who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss is he. Seize him.

49. And straightaway having come to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi, and kissed him much.

50. And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are thou here. Then having come, they threw their hands on Jesus, and seized him.

51. And behold, one of those with Jesus, having stretched out a hand, drew his sword, and when he struck the bondman of the high priest, he cut off his ear.

52. Then Jesus says to him, Return thy sword into its place, for all those who take a sword will die by a sword.

53. Or do thou think that I cannot now call my Father, and he will provide to me more than twelve legions of agents?

54. How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it is necessary to happen this way?

55. In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Did ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.

56. But all this has come to pass, so that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled, having forsook him.

57. And those who seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scholars and the elders were assembled together.

58. But Peter followed him from afar, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And having entered inside, he sat with the subordinates to see the outcome.

59. Now the chief priests and the elders and the whole council sought FALSE testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death,

60. and they did not find it. And although many FALSE witnesses came, they did not find it.

61. But finally two FALSE witnesses having come, they said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it by three days.

62. And the high priest having stood up, he said to him, Answer thou nothing? What do these testify against thee?

63. But Jesus was silent. And having responded, the high priest said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou are the Christ, the Son of God.

64. Jesus says to him, Thou have said. Nevertheless I say to you, Henceforth ye will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming in the clouds of the sky.

65. Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has blasphemed. What further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye heard his blasphemy.

66. What does it seem to you? Having answered, they said, He is deserving of death.

67. Then they spat in his face and struck him with a fist. And some slapped him,

68. saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ. Who is he who struck thee?

69. Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant girl came to him, saying, Thou also were with Jesus the Galilean.

70. But he denied before them all, saying, I do not know what thou say.

71. And when he was gone out into the porch, another woman saw him, and says to them there, This man was also with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

73. And after a little while those who stood, having approached, said to Peter, Surely thou also are of them, for thy accent even makes thee apparent.

74. Then he began to curse vehemently and to swear, I do not know the man. And straightaway a cock sounded.

75. And Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him, Before a cock sounds, thou will deny me thrice. And having gone outside, he wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. But having become morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people held consultation against Jesus in order to condemn him to death.

2. And having bound him, they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

3. Then Judas, who betrayed him, after seeing that he was condemned, having repented, he brought back the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and elders,

4. saying, I sinned, having betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is it to us? See thou to it.

5. And having cast down the silver pieces in the temple, he departed, and after going away, he hanged himself.

6. And after taking the silver pieces, the chief priests said, It is not permitted to put them into the treasury, since it is a price of blood.

7. And having held consultation, they bought the potter's field with them for burial for foreigners.

8. Therefore that field was called the field of blood, to this day.

9. Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, which says, And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price of him who was valued, whom they valued from the sons of Israel,

10. and they gave them for the potter's field, as Lord appointed me.

11. Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him, saying, Are thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou say.

12. And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.

13. Then Pilate says to him, Do thou not hear how many things they testify against thee?

14. And he did not answer him, not even one word, so as for the governor to marvel greatly.

15. Now during a feast the governor had been accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.

16. And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.

17. When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do ye want I should release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?

18. For he knew that they delivered him up because of envy.

19. And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, There is nothing for thee and that righteous man. For I suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

20. But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

21. Now the governor having answered, he said to them, Which of the two do ye want I would release to you? And they said, Barabbas.

22. Pilate says to them, What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, He should be crucified.

23. And the governor said, For what evil has he done? But they cried out even more, saying, He should be crucified.

24. And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather an uproar was developing, after taking water, he washed his hands in front of the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. See ye to it.

25. And having answered, all the people said, His blood be on us, and on our children.

26. Then he released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus he delivered him so that he would be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus into the Praetorium, gathered the whole band to him.

28. And having stripped him, they put a scarlet robe on him.

29. And having woven a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And having knelt down before him, they ridiculed him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews!

30. And having spat upon him, they took the reed and were striking him on his head.

31. And after they ridiculed him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify.

32. And while coming out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They drafted this man, so that he might take his cross.

33. And having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called, the place of a skull,

34. they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall. And having tasted it, he would not drink.

35. And when they crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots.

36. And as they sat, they keep watch over him there.

37. And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. Then two robbers are crucified with him, one at the right hand and one at the left.

39. And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,

40. and saying, Thou who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save thyself. If thou are the Son of God, come down from the cross.

41. And likewise also the chief priests, ridiculing with the scholars, and elders, and Pharisees, said,

42. He saved others, he cannot save himself. If he is the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.

43. He trusted in God, let him rescue him now, if he wants him, for he said, I am the Son of God.

44. And also the robbers who were crucified with him reviled him the same way.

45. Now from the sixth hour darkness developed over all the land until the ninth hour.

46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a great voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?

47. And some of those who stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls Elijah.

48. And straightaway one of them, after running, and having taken a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

49. But the others said, Leave thou be. We might see if Elijah comes he will save him.

50. And Jesus, having cried out again in a great voice, yielded up his spirit.

51. And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks split,

52. and the sepulchers were opened, and many bodies of the sanctified who have been asleep arose.

53. And having come forth out of the sepulchers after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.

54. Now the centurion, and those with him watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that happened, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

55. And many women were there watching from afar, who followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,

56. among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

57. And having become evening, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled by Jesus.

58. This man having come to Pilate, requested the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.

59. And Joseph having taken the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

60. and laid it in his own new sepulcher, which he hewed out in the rock. And having rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, he departed.

61. And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.

62. Now on the morrow, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,

63. saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was still alive, After three days I am raised.

64. Command therefore to secure the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples having come by night steal him away, and say to the people, He was raised from the dead. And the last error will be worse than the first.

65. Pilate said to them, Ye have security. Go, make it as secure as ye know how.

66. And having gone, they made the tomb secure, with the security having sealed the stone.

## Matthew 28

1. Now late on the Sabbath day, being dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.

2. And behold, a great earthquake occurred, for an agent of Lord, having descended from heaven, having come, he rolled the stone away from the door and sat upon it.

3. And his appearance was as lightning and his clothing white as snow.

4. And those watching over shook from fear of him, and became as dead men.

5. And having responded, the agent said to the women, Fear ye not, for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified.

6. He is not here, for he was raised as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

7. And after going quickly, tell his disciples, He was raised from the dead, and lo, he goes before you into Galilee. There ye will see him. Behold, I have told you.

8. And after coming out quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy, they ran to notify his disciples.

9. And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail. And having come, they held his feet and worshiped him.

10. Then Jesus says to them, Fear not. Go notify my brothers that they should depart into Galilee, and there they will see me.

11. Now while they were going, behold, some of the security having come into the city, reported to the chief priests all the things that happened.

12. And after assembling with the elders, and having taken consultation, they gave many silver pieces to the soldiers, saying,

13. Say ye, His disciples, having come by night, stole him from us while we slept.

14. And if this should be heard by the governor, we will persuade him, and will make you worry free.

15. And having taken the silver pieces, they did as they were instructed. And this saying was spread abroad among the Jews until this day.

16. But the eleven disciples went for Galilee to the mountain where Jesus arranged for them.

17. And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but men doubted.

18. And Jesus having come, he spoke to them, saying, All authority in heaven and on earth was given to me.

19. After going, make ye disciples of all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

20. teaching them to observe all things, as many as I commanded you. And lo, I am with you all the days, until the end of the age. Truly.
