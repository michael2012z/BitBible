## Ezekiel 1

1. Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

2. In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,

3. the word of LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar, and the hand of LORD was there upon him.

4. And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it, as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.

5. And out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man.

6. And each one had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.

7. And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like burnished brass.

8. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. And those four had their faces and their wings [thus]:

9. Their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn when they went; they went each one straight forward.

10. As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. And those four had the face of a lion on the right side, and those four had the face of an ox on the left side, those four also had the face of an eagle.

11. And their faces and their wings were separate above, two [wings] of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.

12. And they went each one straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They did not turn when they went.

13. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It went up and down among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth l

14. And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.

15. Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel [was] upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.

16. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. And those four had one likeness, and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.

17. When they went, they went in their four directions. They did not turn when they went.

18. As for their rims, they were high and fearful. And those four had their rims full of eyes round about.

19. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

20. Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there the spirit was to go. And the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

21. When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

22. And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like awesome crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.

23. And under the firmament their wings were straight, the one toward the other. Each one had two which covered their bodies on this side, and each one had two which covered on that side.

24. And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host. When they stood, they let down their wings.

25. And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.

26. And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. And upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.

27. And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward. And from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire. And there

28. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I

## Ezekiel 2

1. And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.

2. And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet. And I heard him who spoke to me.

3. And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.

4. And the sons are impudent and stiff hearted. I send thee to them, and thou shall say to them, Thus says lord LORD.

5. And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.

6. And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dwell among scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebe

7. And thou shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.

8. But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee. Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.

9. And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me, and, lo, a roll of a book was in it,

10. And he spread it before me, and it was written inside and outside. And there were written in it lamentations and mourning and woe.

## Ezekiel 3

1. And he said to me, Son of man, eat that which thou find. Eat this roll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.

2. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.

3. And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

4. And he said to me, Son of man, go, get thee to the house of Israel, and speak to them with my words.

5. For thou are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel,

6. not to many peoples of a strange speech, and of a hard language, whose words thou cannot understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken to thee.

7. But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee, for they will not hearken to me. For all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.

8. Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.

9. As an adamant, harder than flint, I have made thy forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.

10. Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.

11. And go, get thee to those of the captivity, to the sons of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says lord LORD, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

12. Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of LORD from his place.

13. And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched each other, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.

14. So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away. And I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of LORD was strong upon me.

15. Then I came to those of the captivity at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.

16. And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of LORD came to me, saying,

17. Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

18. When I say to a wicked man, Thou shall surely die, and thou give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked man from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at

19. Yet if thou warn the wicked man, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou have delivered thy soul.

20. Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because thou have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which h

21. Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous man not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and thou have delivered thy soul.

22. And the hand of LORD was there upon me, and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will talk with thee there.

23. Then I arose, and went forth into the plain. And, behold, the glory of LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.

24. Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet. And he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.

25. But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shall not escape from them.

26. And I will make thy tongue cling to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shall be mute, and shall not be a reprover to them, for they are a rebellious house.

27. But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shall say to them, Thus says lord LORD. He who hears, let him hear, and he who forbears, let him forbear, for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 4

1. Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem.

2. And lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.

3. And take thou to thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city. And set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

4. Moreover lay thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. [According to] the number of the days that thou shall lay upon it, thou shall bear their iniquity.

5. For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be a number of days to thee, even three hundred and ninety days. So thou shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

6. And again, when thou have accomplished these, thou shall lay on thy right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days, each day for a year. I have appointed it to thee.

7. And thou shall set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered, and thou shall prophesy against it.

8. And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shall not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou have accomplished the days of thy siege.

9. Also take thou to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread of it, [according to] the number of the days that thou shall lay upon thy side, even three hun

10. And thy food which thou shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day. Thou shall eat it from time to time.

11. And thou shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. Thou shall drink from time to time.

12. And thou shall eat it as barley cakes, and thou shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.

13. And LORD said, Even thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will drive them.

14. Then I said, Ah lord LORD! Behold, my soul has not been polluted. For from my youth up even till now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of beasts, neither has abominable flesh come into my mouth.

15. Then he said to me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shall prepare thy bread of it.

16. Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness, and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay,

17. that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.

## Ezekiel 5

1. And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword. [As] a barber's razor thou shall take it to thee, and shall cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard. Then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair.

2. A third part thou shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled, and thou shall take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it, and a third part thou shall scatter to the wind.

3. And thou shall take from it a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.

4. And of these again thou shall take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire shall come forth into all the house of Israel.

5. Thus says lord LORD: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.

6. And she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her, for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have

7. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because ye are more disorderly than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, nor have kept my ordinances, no, ye have not even done according to the ordinances of the

8. therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.

9. And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and of which I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.

10. Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on thee, and I will scatter to all the winds the whole remnant of thee.

11. Therefore, as I live, says lord LORD, surely, because thou have defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore I also will diminish [thee], nor shall my eye spare. And I also will ha

12. A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and they shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee, and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee, and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will

13. Thus my anger shall be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted. And they shall know that I, LORD, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.

14. Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all who pass by.

15. So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, a lesson and an astonishment, to the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes--I, LORD, have spoken it--

16. when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.

17. And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee. And pestilence and blood shall pass through thee. And I will bring the sword upon thee. I, LORD, have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 6

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,

3. and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of lord LORD. Thus says lord LORD to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your hig

4. And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

5. And I will lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

6. In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down,

7. And the slain shall fall in the midst of you. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

8. Yet I will leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some who escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.

9. And those of you who escape shall remember me among the nations where they shall be carried captive, how I have broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with they eyes, which play the harlot after their idols.

10. And they shall know that I am LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.

11. Thus says lord LORD: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.

12. He who is far off shall die of the pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon them.

13. And ye shall know that I am LORD when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places wh

14. And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations. And they shall know that I am LORD.

## Ezekiel 7

1. Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. And thou, son of man, thus says lord LORD to the land of Israel: An end. The end has come upon the four corners of the land.

3. Now the end is upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways. And I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.

4. And my eye shall not spare thee, nor will I have pity. But I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

5. Thus says lord LORD: An evil, an only evil, behold, it comes.

6. An end has come. The end has come. It awakens against thee. Behold, it comes.

7. Thy doom has come to thee, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come. The day is near, tumult, and not joyful shouting, upon the mountains.

8. Now I will shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish my anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways. And I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.

9. And my eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. I will bring upon thee according to thy ways. And thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee. And ye shall know that I, LORD, do smite.

10. Behold, the day, behold, it comes. Thy doom has gone forth. The rod has blossomed; pride has budded.

11. Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. Neither shall there be eminency among them.

12. The time has come; the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all the multitude of it.

13. For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive, for the vision is concerning the whole multitude of it. None shall return, nor shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

14. They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready, but none goes to the battle, for my wrath is upon all the multitude of it.

15. The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine inside. He who is in the field shall die with the sword, and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

16. But those of them who escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys. All of them moaning, each one in his iniquity.

17. All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.

18. They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them. And shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.

19. They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of LORD. They shall not satisfy their souls, nor fill t

20. As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty, but they made the images of their abominations, [and] their detestable things in it. Therefore I have made it as an unclean thing to them.

21. And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil, and they shall profane it.

22. I will also turn my face from them, and they shall profane my secluded [place]. And robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.

23. Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

24. Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong to cease, and their holy places shall be profaned.

25. Destruction comes. And they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.

26. Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor. And they shall seek a vision of the prophet, but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

27. The king shall mourn, and the ruler shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their deserts I will judge them. And they s

## Ezekiel 8

1. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of lord LORD fell there upon me.

2. Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire, from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire, and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.

3. And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head. And the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looks

4. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.

5. Then he said to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and, behold, northward of the gate of the altar [was] this image of jealousy in the entry.

6. And he said to me, Son of man, see thou what they do, even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But thou shall again see yet other great abominations.

7. And he brought me to the door of the court. And when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.

8. Then he said to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall. And when I had dug in the wall, behold, a door.

9. And he said to me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.

10. So I went in and saw, and, behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.

11. And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel. And in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, each man with his censer in his hand, and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.

12. Then he said to me, Son of man, have thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each man in his chambers of imagery? For they say, LORD does not see us. LORD has forsaken the land.

13. He also said to me, Thou shall again see yet other great abominations which they do.

14. Then he brought me to the door of the gate of LORD's house which was toward the north. And, behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.

15. Then he said to me, Have thou seen [this], O son of man? Thou shall again see yet greater abominations than these.

16. And he brought me into the inner court of LORD's house. And, behold, at the door of the temple of LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of LORD, and their faces toward

17. Then he said to me, Have thou seen [this], O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to prov

18. Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.

## Ezekiel 9

1. Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye those who have charge over the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.

2. And, behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lays toward the north, each man with his slaughter weapon in his hand, and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's case by his side. And they we

3. And the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, upon which it was, to the threshold of the house, and he called to the man clothed in linen who had the writer's case by his side.

4. And LORD said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and who cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst of it.

5. And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite. Let not your eye spare, nor have ye pity.

6. Kill utterly the old man, the young man, and the virgin, and little sons, and women, but come not near any man upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men who were before the house.

7. And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.

8. And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah lord LORD! Will thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?

9. Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness. For they say, LORD has forsaken the land, and LORD does not see.

10. And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.

11. And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou have commanded me.

## Ezekiel 10

1. Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

2. And he spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in

3. Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.

4. And the glory of LORD mounted up from the cherub, over the threshold of the house. And the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of LORD's glory.

5. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.

6. And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.

7. And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.

8. And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.

9. And I looked, and, behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. And the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.

10. And as for their appearance, those four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.

11. When they went, they went in their four directions. They did not turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They did not turn as they went.

12. And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that those four had.

13. As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, O wheel.

14. And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

15. And the cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.

16. And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn from beside them.

17. When they stood, these stood, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creature was in them.

18. And the glory of LORD went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.

19. And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them. And they stood at the door of the east gate of LORD's house, and the glory of the God of Israel was

20. This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.

21. Each one had four faces, and each one four wings. And the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

22. And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They went each one straight forward.

## Ezekiel 11

1. Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of LORD's house, which looks eastward. And, behold, at the door of the gate twenty-five men. And I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah

2. And he said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city,

3. who say, [The time] is not near to build houses. This [city] is the caldron, and we are the flesh.

4. Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, O son of man.

5. And the Spirit of LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, Speak, Thus says LORD: Thus ye have said, O house of Israel, for I know the things that come into your mind.

6. Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.

7. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this [city] is the caldron, but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.

8. Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, says lord LORD.

9. And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.

10. Ye shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel, and ye shall know that I am LORD.

11. This [city] shall not be your caldron, nor shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof. I will judge you in the border of Israel,

12. and ye shall know that I am LORD. For ye have not walked in my statutes, nor have ye executed my ordinances, but have done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.

13. And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah lord LORD! Will thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?

14. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

15. Son of man, thy brothers, even thy brothers, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, [are those] to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from LORD. This land is given to us for a posses

16. Therefore say, Thus says lord LORD: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have

17. Therefore say, Thus says lord LORD. I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

18. And they shall come there, and they shall take away from there all the detestable things of it and all the abominations of it.

19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,

20. that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

21. But as for those whose heart walks according to the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, says lord LORD.

22. Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

23. And the glory of LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

24. And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

25. Then I spoke to those of the captivity all the things that LORD had shown me.

## Ezekiel 12

1. The word of LORD also came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, thou dwell in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not, for they are a rebellious house.

3. Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. And thou shall move from thy place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.

4. And thou shall bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. And thou shall go forth thyself at evening in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.

5. Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out by that.

6. Thou shall bear it upon thy shoulder in their sight, and carry it forth in the dark. Thou shall cover thy face, that thou not see the land. For I have set thee for a sign to the house of Israel.

7. And I did so as I was commanded. I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it upon my shoulder in their sight.

8. And in the morning the word of LORD came to me, saying,

9. Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What are thou doing?

10. Say thou to them, Thus says lord LORD: This burden [concerns] the ruler in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.

11. Say, I am your sign. Just as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.

12. And the ruler who is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth. They shall dig through the wall to carry out by it. He shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.

13. I will also spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.

14. And I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about him to help him, and all his groups. And I will draw out the sword after them.

15. And they shall know that I am LORD, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.

16. But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. And they shall know that I am LORD.

17. Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness.

19. And say to the people of the land, Thus says lord LORD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate of

20. And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

21. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

22. Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?

23. Tell them therefore, Thus says lord LORD: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel, but say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.

24. For there shall no more be any FALSE vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.

25. For I am LORD. I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed. It shall be no more deferred. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it, says lord LORD.

26. Again the word of LORD came to me, saying,

27. Son of man, behold, those of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.

28. Therefore say to them, Thus says lord LORD: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 13

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say thou to those who prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of LORD.

3. Thus says lord LORD: Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

4. O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.

5. Ye have not gone up into the gaps, nor built up the wall for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of LORD.

6. They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, LORD says, but LORD has not sent them. And they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.

7. Have ye not seen a FALSE vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, LORD says, albeit I have not spoken?

8. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, says lord LORD.

9. And my hand shall be against the prophets who see FALSE visions, and who divine lies. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the

10. Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace, and there is no peace, and when [a man] builds up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered [mortar],

11. say to those who daub it with untempered [mortar], that it shall fall. There shall be an overflowing shower, and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall rend it.

12. Lo, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed it?

13. Therefore thus says lord LORD: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.

14. So I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered. And it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst of it. And ye

15. Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have daubed it with untempered [mortar]. And I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who daubed it,

16. [namely], the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says lord LORD.

17. And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart, and prophesy thou against them.

18. And say, Thus says lord LORD: Woe to the women who sew pillows upon all elbows, and make headdresses for the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?

19. And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.

20. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against your pillows, with which ye hunt the souls there to make fly, and I will tear them from your arms. And I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make fly.

21. I will also tear your headdresses, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

22. Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.

23. Therefore ye shall no more see FALSE visions, nor divine divinations. And I will deliver my people out of your hand. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

## Ezekiel 14

1. Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me.

2. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

3. Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. Should I be inquired of at all by them?

4. Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet, I LORD will

5. that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

6. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says lord LORD: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.

7. For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, that separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prop

8. And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb. And I will cut him off from the midst of my people. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

9. And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, LORD, have deceived that prophet. And I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

10. And they shall bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him who seeks [him],

11. that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves any more with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says lord LORD.

12. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

13. Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,

14. though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, says lord LORD.

15. If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts,

16. though these three men were in it, as I live, says lord LORD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, they only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.

17. Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, so that I cut off from it man and beast,

18. though these three men were in it, as I live, says lord LORD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only would be delivered themselves.

19. Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast,

20. though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says lord LORD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter, they would but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

21. For thus says lord LORD: How much more when I send my four severe judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!

22. Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in it that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come forth to you, and ye shall see their way and their doings. And ye shall be comforted concerning the evil

23. And they shall comfort you when ye see their way and their doings. And ye shall know that I have not done all that I have done in it, without cause, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 15

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?

3. Shall wood be taken of it to make any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

4. Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The fire has devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work?

5. Behold, when it was whole, it was fit for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be fit for any work!

6. Therefore thus says lord LORD: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

7. And I will set my face against them. They shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them. And ye shall know that I am LORD when I set my face against them.

8. And I will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 16

1. Again the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

3. and say, Thus says lord LORD to Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is from the land of the Canaanite. The Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.

4. And as for thy nativity, in the day thou were born thy navel was not cut, nor were thou washed in water to cleanse thee. Thou were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

5. No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things to thee, to have compassion upon thee, but thou were cast out in the open field. For thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou were born.

6. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said to thee, in thy blood, Live! Yea, I said to thee, in thy blood, Live!

7. I caused thee to multiply as that which grows in the field, and thou increased and grew great. And thou attained to excellent ornament, thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown. Yet thou were naked and bare.

8. Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love. And I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness. Yea, I swore to thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, says lord LORD, and th

9. Then I washed thee with water. Yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

10. I also clothed thee with embroidered work, and shod thee with badger skin. And I girded thee around with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.

11. And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.

12. And I put a ring upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.

13. Thus thou were decked with gold and silver, and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered work. Thou ate fine flour, and honey, and oil. And thou were very beautiful, and thou prospered to royalty.

14. And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty. For it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, says lord LORD.

15. But thou trusted in thy beauty, and played the harlot because of thy renown, and poured out thy whoredoms on everyone who passed by; his it was.

16. And thou took of thy garments, and made high places for thee, decked with various colors, and played the harlot upon them, [things which] should not come, nor should it be.

17. Thou also took thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and made for thee images of men, and played the harlot with them.

18. And thou took thy embroidered garments, and covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them.

19. My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour and oil and honey, with which I fed thee, thou even set it before them for a sweet savor, and [thus] it was, says lord LORD.

20. Moreover thou have taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou have borne to me, and thou have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,

21. that thou have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through [the fire] to them?

22. And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou have not remembered the days of thy youth when thou were naked and bare, and were weltering in thy blood.

23. And it has come to pass according to all thy wickedness, (woe, woe to thee! says lord LORD),

24. that thou have built thyself a vaulted place, and have made thee a lofty place in every street.

25. Thou have built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and have made thy beauty an abomination. And have opened thy feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom.

26. Thou have also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh, and have multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger.

27. Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thy portion, and delivered thee to the will of those who hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.

28. Thou have played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou were insatiable. Yea, thou have played the harlot with them, and yet thou were not satisfied.

29. Thou have moreover multiplied thy whoredom to the land of traffic, to Chaldea, and yet thou were not satisfied with this.

30. How weak is thy heart, says lord LORD, seeing thou do all these things, the work of an impudent harlot,

31. in that thou build thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and make thy lofty place in every street. And have not [even] been as a harlot, in that thou scorn hire.

32. A wife who commits adultery, who takes strangers instead of her husband!

33. They give gifts to all harlots, but thou give thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to thee on every side for thy whoredoms.

34. And thou are different from [other] women in thy whoredoms, in that none follows thee to play the harlot. And whereas thou give a wage, and no wage is given to thee, therefore thou are different.

35. Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of LORD.

36. Thus says lord LORD: Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy sons, that thou gave to them,

37. therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou have taken pleasure, and all those whom thou have loved, with all those whom thou have hated, I will even gather them against thee on every side. And I will uncover th

38. And I will judge thee, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged. And I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.

39. I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places. And they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels, and they shall leave thee naked and bare.

40. They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.

41. And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women. And I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shall also give no wage any more.

42. So I will cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will no more be angry.

43. Because thou have not remembered the days of thy youth, but have raged against me in all these things, therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, says lord LORD. And thou shall not commit this lewdness with all thi

44. Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use [this] proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

45. Thou are the daughter of thy mother, who loathes her husband and her sons. And thou are the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their sons. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

46. And thine elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at thy left hand, she and her daughters. And thy younger sister, who dwells at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

47. Yet thou have not walked in their ways, nor done according to their abominations, but, like [it was] a very little [thing], thou were more corrupt than they in all thy ways.

48. As I live, says lord LORD, Sodom thy sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as thou have done, thou and thy daughters.

49. Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters, and she did not strengthen the hand of a poor and needy man.

50. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away as I saw [fit].

51. Neither has Samaria committed half of thy sins, but thou have multiplied thine abominations more than they, and have justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou have done.

52. Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou have given judgment for thy sisters, through thy sins that thou have committed more abominable than they. They are more righteous than thou. Yea, be thou also confounded, and bear

53. And I will turn back again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them,

54. that thou may bear thine own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that thou have done, in that thou are a comfort to them.

55. And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.

56. For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,

57. before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, who do despite to thee round about.

58. Thou have borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, says LORD.

59. For thus says lord LORD: I will also deal with thee as thou have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

60. Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.

61. Then thou shall remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shall receive thy sisters, thine elder [sisters] and thy younger, and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.

62. And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shall know that I am LORD,

63. that thou may remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou have done, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 17

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,

3. and say, Thus says lord LORD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had various colors, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar.

4. He cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it, and carried it to a land of merchandise. He set it in a city of merchants.

5. He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree.

6. And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots of it were under him. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.

7. There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. And, behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.

8. It was planted in a good soil by many waters that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine.

9. Say thou, Thus says lord LORD: Shall it flourish? Shall he not pull up the roots of it, and cut off the fruit of it, that it may wither? It shall wither in all its fresh springing leaves, even without great power or many people to

10. Yea, behold, being planted, shall it flourish? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.

11. Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,

12. Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king of it, and the rulers of it, and brought them to him to Babylon.

13. And he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land,

14. that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.

15. But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt that they might give him horses and many people. Shall he prosper? Shall he escape who does such things? Shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?

16. As I live, says lord LORD, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.

17. Nor shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons.

18. For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant. And, behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things. He shall not escape.

19. Therefore thus says lord LORD: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.

20. And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.

21. And all his fugitives in all his groups shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind. And ye shall know that I, LORD, have spoken it.

22. Thus says lord LORD: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it. I will crop off a tender one from the topmost of its young twigs, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain.

23. I will plant it in the mountain of the height of Israel, and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar. And all birds of every wing shall dwell under it; they shall dwell in the shade of the branches thereo

24. And all the trees of the field shall know that I, LORD, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. I, LORD, have spoken and have done it.

## Ezekiel 18

1. The word of LORD came to me again, saying,

2. What do ye mean, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the son's teeth are set on edge?

3. As I live, says lord LORD, ye shall not have [occasion] any more to use this proverb in Israel.

4. Behold, all souls are mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it shall die.

5. But if a man be just, and does that which is lawful and right.

6. And has not eaten upon the mountains, nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor has defiled his neighbor's wife, nor has come near to a woman in her impurity,

7. and has not wronged any man, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to a hungry man, and has covered a naked man with a garment,

8. he who has not given forth upon interest, nor has taken any increase, who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed TRUE justice between man and man,

9. has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly, he is just. He shall surely live, says lord LORD.

10. If he begets a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood, and who does any one of these things,

11. and who does not do any of those [duties], but has even eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,

12. has wronged the poor and needy man, has taken by robbery, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,

13. has given forth upon interest, and has taken increase, shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations. He shall surely die. His blood shall be upon him.

14. Now, lo, if he begets a son, who sees all his father's sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not do such like,

15. who has not eaten upon the mountains, nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighbor's wife,

16. nor has wronged any man, has not taken anything to pledge, nor has taken by robbery, but has given his bread to a hungry man, and has covered a naked man with a garment,

17. who has withdrawn his hand from a poor man, who has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes, he shall not die for the iniquity of his father. He shall surely live.

18. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.

19. Yet say ye, Why does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.

20. The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of a righteous man shall be upon him, and the wickedness of a wicked man shal

21. But if a wicked man turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die.

22. None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him. In his righteousness that he has done he shall live.

23. Have I any pleasure in the death of a wicked man? says lord LORD, and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?

24. But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered. I

25. Yet ye say, The way of LORD is not equitable. Hear now, O house of Israel. Is not my way equitable? Are not your ways inequitable?

26. When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in it, in his iniquity that he has done, he shall die.

27. Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.

28. Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall not die.

29. Yet the house of Israel says, The way of LORD is not equitable. O house of Israel, are not my ways equitable? Are not your ways inequitable?

30. Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one according to his ways, says lord LORD. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.

31. Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new spirit. For why will ye die, O house of Israel?

32. For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies, says lord LORD, therefore turn yourselves back, and live.

## Ezekiel 19

1. Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the rulers of Israel,

2. and say, What was thy mother? A lioness. She couched among lions. In the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.

3. And she brought up one of her whelps. He became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey. He devoured men.

4. The nations also heard of him. He was taken in their pit, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.

5. Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.

6. And he went up and down among the lions. He became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey. He devoured men.

7. And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities. And the land was desolate, and the fullness of it, because of the noise of his roaring.

8. Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and they spread their net over him. He was taken in their pit.

9. And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

10. Thy mother was like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters. It was fruitful and full of branches because of many waters.

11. And it had strong twigs for the scepters of those who bore rule. And their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.

12. But it was plucked up in fury. It was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong twigs were broken off and withered. The fire consumed them.

13. And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.

14. And fire has gone out of the twigs of its branches. It has devoured its fruit, so that there is no strong twig in it to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

## Ezekiel 20

1. And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of LORD, and sat before me.

2. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

3. Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Is it to inquire of me that ye have come? As I live, says lord LORD, I will not be inquired of by you.

4. Will thou judge them, son of man. Will thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers,

5. and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am LORD your God,

6. I swore to them in that day, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.

7. And I said to them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am LORD your God.

8. But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me. They did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my

9. But I worked for my name's sake (that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them) in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

10. So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.

11. And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them.

12. Moreover I also gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am LORD who sanctifies them.

13. But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. And they greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I wou

14. But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.

15. Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,

16. because they rejected my ordinances, and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths, for their heart went after their idols.

17. Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroyed them, nor did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.

18. And I said to their sons in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers. Neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.

19. I am LORD your God. Walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them,

20. and hallow my Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am LORD your God.

21. But the sons rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes, nor kept my ordinances to do them, which if a man does, he shall live in them. They profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accom

22. Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.

23. Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries,

24. because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.

25. Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they will not live.

26. And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am LORD.

27. Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: In this moreover your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

28. For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. The

29. Then I said to them, What does the high place to which ye go mean? So the name of it is called Bamah to this day.

30. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says lord LORD: Do ye pollute yourselves according to the manner of your fathers, and play ye the harlot according to their abominations?

31. And when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says lord LORD, I will not be

32. And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.

33. As I live, says lord LORD, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.

34. And I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries in which ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out,

35. and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples. And there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.

36. Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says lord LORD.

37. And I will cause you to pass under the rod. And I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.

38. And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those who transgress against me. I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

39. As for you, O house of Israel, thus says lord LORD: Go ye. Serve each one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken to me. But ye shall no more profane my holy name with your gifts, and with your idols.

40. For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says lord LORD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings, and the fi

41. I will accept you as a sweet savor when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries in which ye have been scattered. And I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.

42. And ye shall know that I am LORD when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I swore to give to your fathers.

43. And there ye shall remember your ways, and all your doings, by which ye have polluted yourselves. And ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.

44. And ye shall know that I am LORD when I have dealt with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, says lord LORD.

45. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

46. Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop [thy word] toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South.

47. And say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of LORD. Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree. The flaming flame shall not be quenched, and al

48. And all flesh shall see that I, LORD, have kindled it. It shall not be quenched.

49. Then I said, Ah lord LORD! They say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?

## Ezekiel 21

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop [thy word] toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel.

3. And say to the land of Israel, Thus says LORD: Behold, I am against thee. And will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.

4. Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword shall go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.

5. And all flesh shall know that I, LORD, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath. It shall not return any more.

6. Sigh therefore, thou son of man. With the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness thou shall sigh before their eyes.

7. And it shall be, when they say to thee, Why do thou sigh? That thou shall say, Because of the news. For it comes, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak

8. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

9. Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says LORD: Say, A sword, a sword. It is sharpened, and also furbished.

10. It is sharpened that it may make a slaughter. It is polished that it may be as lightning. Shall we then make mirth? It scorns the scepter of my son, every tree.

11. And it is given to be polished, that it may be handled. The sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.

12. Cry and wail, son of man, for it is upon my people. It is upon all the rulers of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Smite therefore upon thy thigh.

13. For there is a trial, and what if even the rod that scorns shall be no more? says lord LORD.

14. Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together. And let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded. It is the sword of the great [man] who is deadly wounded, which enters into their cha

15. I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied. Ah! It is made as lightning. It is pointed for slaughter.

16. Gather thee together. Go to the right. Set thyself in array. Go to the left, wherever thy face is set.

17. I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest. I, LORD, have spoken it.

18. The word of LORD came to me again, saying,

19. Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. Those two shall come forth out of one land. And mark out a place. Mark it out at the head of the way to the city.

20. Thou shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.

21. For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows to and fro. He consulted the teraphim. He looked in the liver.

22. In his right hand was the divination [for] Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.

23. And it shall be to them as a FALSE divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them. But he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.

24. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear, because ye have come to remembrance, ye shall be taken w

25. And thou, O deadly wounded wicked man, the ruler of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,

26. thus says lord LORD: Remove the miter, and take off the crown. This [shall be] no more the same. Exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.

27. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also shall be no more, until he comes whose right it is. And I will give it.

28. And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says lord LORD concerning the sons of Ammon, and concerning their reproach. And say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn. It is polished for the slaughter, to cause it to devour, that it may

29. while they see for thee FALSE visions, while they divine lies to thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.

30. Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou were created, in the land of thy birth, I will judge thee.

31. And I will pour out my indignation upon thee. I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.

32. Thou shall be for fuel to the fire. Thy blood shall be in the midst of the land. Thou shall no more be remembered. For I, LORD, have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 22

1. Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. And thou, son of man, will thou judge, will thou judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations.

3. And thou shall say, Thus says lord LORD: A city that sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and who makes idols against herself to defile her!

4. Thou have become guilty in thy blood that thou have shed, and are defiled in thine idols which thou have made. And thou have caused thy days to draw near, and have come even to thy years. Therefore I have made thee a reproach to th

5. Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, thou infamous one, full of tumult.

6. Behold, the rulers of Israel, each one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood.

7. In thee they have made light of father and mother. In the midst of thee they have dealt with the sojourner by oppression. In thee they have wronged the fatherless and the widow.

8. Thou have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.

9. Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood, and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains. In the midst of thee they have committed lewdness.

10. In thee have they uncovered their fathers' nakedness. In thee have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.

11. And one has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife, and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law, and another in thee has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.

12. In thee they have taken bribes to shed blood. Thou have taken interest and increase. And thou have greedily gained from thy neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me, says lord LORD.

13. Behold, therefore, I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou have made, and at thy blood which has been in the midst of thee.

14. Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I, LORD, have spoken it, and will do it.

15. And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries, and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

16. And thou shall be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations. And thou shall know that I am LORD.

17. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace. They are the dross of silver.

19. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because ye have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem

20. as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it. So I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.

21. Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst of it.

22. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so ye shall be melted in the midst of it. And ye shall know that I, LORD, have poured out my wrath upon you.

23. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

24. Son of man, say to her, Thou are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

25. There is a conspiracy by her prophets in the midst of it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey. They have devoured souls. They take treasure and precious things. They have made her widows many in the midst thereof.

26. Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, nor have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their ey

27. Her rulers in the midst of it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.

28. And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered [mortar], seeing FALSE visions, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus says lord LORD, when LORD has not spoken.

29. The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery. Yea, they have vexed the poor and needy man, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.

30. And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.

31. Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have brought their own way upon their heads, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 23

1. The word of LORD came again to me, saying,

2. Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.

3. And they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth. There their breasts were pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.

4. And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.

5. And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors,

6. who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

7. And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them. And on whomever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.

8. Neither has she left her whoredoms since Egypt. For in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity, and they poured out their whoredom upon her.

9. Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

10. These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a byword among women, for they executed judgments upon her.

11. And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.

12. She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.

13. And I saw that she was defiled. They both took one way.

14. And she increased her whoredoms, for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,

15. girded with belts upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them rulers to look upon, according to the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.

16. And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.

17. And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love. And they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.

18. So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just as my soul was alienated from her sister.

19. Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.

20. And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

21. Thus thou called to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.

22. Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:

23. the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, rulers and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.

24. And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about. And I will commit the judgment to them, and

25. And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury. They shall take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy residue shall fall by the sword. They shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy residue shal

26. They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.

27. Thus I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom from the land of Egypt, so that thou shall not lift up thine eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.

28. For thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of those whom thou hate, into the hand of those from whom thy soul is alienated.

29. And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare. And the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

30. These things shall be done to thee, because thou have played the harlot after the nations, and because thou are polluted with their idols.

31. Thou have walked in the way of thy sister, therefore I will give her cup into thy hand.

32. Thus says lord LORD: Thou shall drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and large. Thou shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision. It contains much.

33. Thou shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.

34. Thou shall even drink it and drain it out. And thou shall gnaw the shards of it, and shall tear thy breasts, for I have spoken it, says lord LORD.

35. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because thou have forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore thou also bear thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

36. LORD said moreover to me, Son of man, will thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.

37. For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. And with their idols they have committed adultery. And they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] for them to be devoured.

38. Moreover they have done this to me: They have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.

39. For when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it, and, lo, thus they have done in the midst of my house.

40. And furthermore ye have sent for men who come from far, to whom a messenger was sent. And, lo, they came, for whom thou washed thyself, painted thine eyes, and decked thyself with ornaments,

41. and sat upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou did set my incense and my oil.

42. And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. And with men of the common sort, were brought drunkards from the wilderness, and they put bracelets upon the hands of those [two women], and beautiful crowns upon their heads

43. Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, Now they will play the harlot with her, and she [with them].

44. And they went in to her, as they go in to a harlot. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.

45. And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.

46. For thus says lord LORD: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.

47. And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

48. Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.

49. And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols. And ye shall know that I am lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 24

1. Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, write thee the name of the day, [even] of this selfsame day; the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this selfsame day.

3. And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Set on the caldron. Set it on, and also pour water into it.

4. Gather the pieces of it into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

5. Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile [of wood] for the bones under [the caldron]. Make it boil well, yea, let the bones of it be boiled in the midst of it.

6. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece. No lot has fallen upon it.

7. For her blood is in the midst of her. She set it upon the bare rock. She did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust.

8. That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.

9. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.

10. Heap on the wood; make the fire hot. Boil the flesh well, and make the broth thick. And let the bones be burned.

11. Then set it empty upon the coals of it, that it may be hot, and the brass of it may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.

12. She has wearied [herself] with toil, yet her great scum does not go forth out of her, her scum by fire.

13. In thy filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed thee and thou were not cleansed, thou shall not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.

14. I, LORD, have spoken it. It shall come to pass, and I will do it. I will not go back. I will neither spare, nor will I repent. According to thy ways, and according to thy doings, they shall judge thee, says lord LORD.

15. Also the word of LORD came to me, saying,

16. Son of man, behold, I take the desire of thine eyes away from thee with a stroke. Yet thou shall neither mourn nor weep. Neither shall thy tears run down.

17. Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind thy headdress upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet. And do not cover thy lips, and do not eat the bread of men.

18. So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded.

19. And the people said to me, Will thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou do so?

20. Then I said to them, The word of LORD came to me, saying,

21. Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul has compassion. And your sons and your daughters whom ye have left b

22. And ye shall do as I have done. Ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.

23. And your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet. Ye shall not mourn nor weep, but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.

24. Thus Ezekiel shall be to you a sign, according to all that he has done ye shall do. When this comes, then ye shall know that I am lord LORD.

25. And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that upon which they set their heart--their sons and their daughters--

26. that in that day he who escapes shall come to thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?

27. In that day thy mouth shall be opened to him who is escaped, and thou shall speak, and no more be mute. So thou shall be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am LORD.

## Ezekiel 25

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face toward the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them.

3. And say to the sons of Ammon, Hear the word of lord LORD. Thus says lord LORD: Because thou said, Aha, against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Ju

4. therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the sons of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee. They shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.

5. And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the sons of Ammon a couching-place for flocks. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

6. For thus says lord LORD: Because thou have clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the spite of thy soul against the land of Israel,

7. therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations. And I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries. I will destroy thee, and t

8. Thus says lord LORD: Because Moab and Seir say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,

9. therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country--Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim--

10. [open] to the sons of the east, against the sons of Ammon. And I will give them for a possession, that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.

11. And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am LORD.

12. Thus says lord LORD: Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them,

13. therefore thus says lord LORD: I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it, and I will make it desolate. From Teman, even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.

14. And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath. And they shall know my vengeance, says lord LORD.

15. Thus says lord LORD: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with spite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity,

16. therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

17. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes. And they shall know that I am LORD when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

## Ezekiel 26

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [day] of the month, that the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken, the gate of the peoples. She has turned around to me. I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste,

3. therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causes its waves to come up.

4. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.

5. She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken it, says lord LORD. And she shall become a spoil to the nations,

6. and her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword. And they shall know that I am LORD.

7. For thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and many people.

8. He shall kill thy daughters in the field with the sword. And he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee.

9. And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.

10. Because of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee. Thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city in which a

11. With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets. He shall kill thy people with the sword, and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.

12. And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise. And they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses, and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the wate

13. And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall no more be heard.

14. And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shall be a place for the spreading of nets. Thou shall be built no more, for I LORD have spoken it, says lord LORD.

15. Thus says lord LORD to Tyre: Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?

16. Then all the rulers of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling. They shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble ev

17. And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How thou are destroyed, who were inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on a

18. Now the isles shall tremble in the day of thy fall. Yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure.

19. For thus says lord LORD: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee,

20. then I will bring thee down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, th

21. I will make thee a horror, and thou shall no more have any being. Though thou be sought for, yet thou shall never be found again, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 27

1. The word of LORD came again to me, saying,

2. And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre,

3. and say to Tyre, O thou that dwells at the entry of the sea, that is the merchant of the peoples to many isles, thus says lord LORD: Thou, O Tyre, have said, I am perfect in beauty.

4. Thy borders are in the heart of the seas. Thy builders have perfected thy beauty.

5. They have made all thy planks of fir trees from Senir. They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.

6. Of the oaks of Bashan they have made thine oars. They have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim.

7. Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign. Blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.

8. The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers. Thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee; they were thy pilots.

9. The old men of Gebal and, the wise men thereof, were thy caulkers in thee. All the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise.

10. Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in thee. They set forth thy comeliness.

11. The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and valorous men were in thy towers. They hung their shields upon thy walls round about. They have perfected thy beauty.

12. Tarshish was thy merchant because of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with silver, iron, tin, and lead. They traded for thy wares.

13. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants. They traded the persons of men, and vessels of brass for thy merchandise.

14. Those of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules.

15. The men of Dedan were thy merchants. Many isles were the mart of thy hand. They brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony.

16. Syria was thy merchant because of the multitude of thy handiworks. They traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies.

17. Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants. They traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.

18. Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks, because of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

19. Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares. Bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise.

20. Dedan was thy merchant in precious cloths for riding.

21. Arabia, and all the rulers of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand, in lambs, and rams, and goats. In these they were thy merchants.

22. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants. They traded for thy wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.

23. Haran and Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur [and] Chilmad, were thy merchants.

24. These were thy merchants in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and embroidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

25. The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise. And thou were replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.

26. Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters. The east wind has broken thee in the heart of the seas.

27. Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy caulkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, who are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall int

28. At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake.

29. And all who handled the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships. They shall stand upon the land,

30. and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads. They shall wallow themselves in the ashes.

31. And they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.

32. And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, [saying], Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?

33. When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filled many peoples. Thou enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

34. In the time that thou were broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company fell in the midst of thee.

35. All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance.

36. The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee. Thou have become a horror, and thou shall nevermore have any being.

4. By thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou have gotten thee riches, and have gotten gold and silver into thy treasures.

5. By thy great wisdom [and] by thy traffic thou have increased thy riches. And thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches.

6. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because thou have set thy heart as the heart of God,

7. therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations, and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.

8. They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shall die the death of those who are slain, in the heart of the seas.

9. Will thou yet say before him who slays thee, I am God? But thou are man, and not God, in the hand of him who wounds thee.

10. Thou shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers. For I have spoken it, says lord LORD.

11. Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,

12. Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says lord LORD: Thou seal up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

13. Thou were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold. The workmanship of t

15. Thou were perfect in thy ways from the day that thou were created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.

16. By the abundance of thy commerce they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou have sinned. Therefore I have cast thee out of the mountain of God as profane, and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of t

17. Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty. Thou have corrupted thy wisdom because of thy brightness. I have cast thee to the ground. I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

3. Speak, and say, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lays in the midst of his rivers, that has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.

4. And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick to thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick to thy scales.

5. And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers. Thou shall fall upon the open field. Thou shall not be brought together, nor gathered. I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and t

6. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

7. When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou broke, and tore all their shoulders. And when they leaned upon thee, thou broke, and made all their loins to be at a stand [still].

8. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.

9. And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. And they shall know that I am LORD. Because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it,

11. No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it. Neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

15. It shall be the basest of the kingdoms, nor shall it lift itself up any more above the nations. And I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.

4. And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.

5. Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub, and the sons of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.

6. Thus says LORD: They also who uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down. From the tower of Seveneh they shall fall in it by the sword, says lord LORD.

7. And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.

8. And they shall know at I am LORD when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.

9. In that day messengers shall go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt, for, lo, it comes.

10. Thus says lord LORD: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

11. He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land. And they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

12. And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men. And I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers. I, LORD, have spoken it.

13. Thus says lord LORD: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis. And there shall no more be a ruler from the land of Egypt. And I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.

3. Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature, and its top was among the thick boughs.

4. The waters nourished it. The deep made it to grow. The rivers of it ran round about its plantation, and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.

5. Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field, and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of many waters, when it shot [them] forth.

6. All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs, and under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young, and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.

7. Thus it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was by many waters.

8. The cedars in the garden of God could not dim it. The fir trees were not like its boughs, and the plane trees were not as its branches, nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.

9. I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.

10. Therefore thus said lord LORD: Because thou are exalted in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height,

11. I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.

5. And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.

6. I will also water the land, in which thou swim, with thy blood, even to the mountains. And the watercourses shall be full of thee.

7. And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars of it dark. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.

9. I will also vex the hearts of many peoples when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou have not known.

10. Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee. And their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when I shall brandish my sword before them. And they shall tremble at every moment, each man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.

11. For thus says lord LORD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.

12. By the swords of the mighty I will cause thy multitude to fall. They are all the terrible of the nations. And they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude of it shall be destroyed.

13. I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters. Neither the foot of man shall trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

14. Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says lord LORD.

15. When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall smite all those who dwell therein, then they shall know that I am LORD.

16. This is the lamentation with which they shall lament. The daughters of the nations shall lament with that over Egypt, and over all her multitude. They shall lament with that, says lord LORD.

17. It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day] of the month, that the word of LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to the nether parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.

19. Whom do thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.

20. They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away and all her multitudes.

21. The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him. They have gone down. They lay still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

22. Asshur is there and all her company. Her graves are round about her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword,

23. whose graves are set in the outermost parts of the pit. And her company is round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.

24. There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have bor

25. They have set a bed for her in the midst of the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are round about her, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword. For their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne

26. There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are round about them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, for they caused their terror in the land of the living.

27. And they shall not lay with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads. But their iniquities are upon their bones, for [they w

28. But thou shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shall lay with those who are slain by the sword.

29. There is Edom, her kings and all her rulers, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. They shall lay with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.

30. There are the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain. In the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame. And they lay uncircumcised with those who are slain by

31. Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, says lord LORD.

32. For I have put his terror in the land of the living, and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 33

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, speak to the sons of thy people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman,

3. if, when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people,

4. then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes no warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.

5. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took no warning; his blood shall be upon him. Whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.

6. But if the watchman sees the sword come, and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at the

7. So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

8. When I say to the wicked man, O wicked man, thou shall surely die, and thou do not speak to warn the wicked man from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.

9. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked man of his way to turn from it, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou have delivered thy soul.

10. And thou, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?

11. Say to them, As I live, says lord LORD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked man, but that the wicked man turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

12. And thou, son of man, say to the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression. And as for the wickedness of the wicked man, he shall not fall by it in the day that

13. When I say to the righteous man, that he shall surely live, if he trusts his righteousness, and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered, but in his iniquity that he has committed, in it he shall die.

14. Again, when I say to the wicked man, Thou shall surely die, if he turns from his sin, and does that which is lawful and right,

15. if the wicked man restores the pledge, gives again that which he had taken by robbery, walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die.

16. None of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him. He has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.

17. Yet the sons of thy people say, The way of LORD is not equitable. But as for them, their way is not equitable.

18. When the righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall even die in it.

19. And when the wicked man turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

20. Yet ye say, The way of LORD is not equitable. O house of Israel, I will judge you everyone according to his ways.

21. And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, that [a man] who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.

22. Now the hand of LORD had been upon me in the evening, before he who escaped came. And he had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning. And my mouth was opened, and I was no more mute.

23. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

24. Son of man, those who inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.

25. Therefore say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. And shall ye possess the land?

26. Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every man his neighbor's wife. And shall ye possess the land?

27. Thus shall thou say to them. Thus says lord LORD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and he who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the stron

28. And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment. And the pride of her power shall cease. And the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.

29. Then they shall know that I am LORD when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.

30. And as for thee, son of man, the sons of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, each one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth f

31. And they come to thee as the people come, and they sit before thee as my people. And they hear thy words, but do not do them. For with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.

32. And, lo, thou are to them as a very lovely song of he who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument. For they hear thy words, but they do not do them.

33. And when this comes to pass, (behold, it comes), then they shall know that a prophet has been among them.

## Ezekiel 34

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says lord LORD: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the sheep?

3. Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe yourselves with the wool. Ye kill the fatlings, but ye do not feed the sheep.

4. Ye have not strengthened the diseased, nor have ye healed that which was sick, nor have ye bound up that which was broken, nor have ye brought back that which was driven away, nor have ye sought that which was lost, but ye have rul

5. And they were scattered because there was no shepherd. And they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.

6. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill. Yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth, and there was none who searched or sought.

7. Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of LORD:

8. As I live, says lord LORD, surely inasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, nor did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselve

9. therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of LORD.

10. Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. Neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more, and I will deliver my sheep f

11. For thus says lord LORD: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.

12. As a shepherd seeks out his flock, in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out my sheep, and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

13. And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the

14. I will feed them with good pasture, and their fold shall be upon the mountains of the height of Israel. There they shall lay down in a good fold, and on fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel.

15. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lay down, says lord LORD.

16. I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick, but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will feed them in justic

17. And as for you, O my flock, thus says lord LORD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.

18. Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture, and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?

19. And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.

20. Therefore thus says lord LORD to them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.

21. Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad,

22. therefore I will save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.

23. And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David. He shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

24. And I, LORD, will be their God, and my servant David ruler among them. I, LORD, have spoken it.

25. And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

26. And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing, and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.

27. And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. And they shall know that I am LORD when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them

28. And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the earth devour them, but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.

29. And I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they shall no more be consumed with famine in the land, nor bear the shame of the nations any more.

30. And they shall know that I, LORD, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says lord LORD.

31. And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 35

1. Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it.

3. And say to it, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment.

4. I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shall be desolate. And thou shall know that I am LORD.

5. Because thou have had a perpetual enmity, and have given over the sons of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end,

6. therefore, as I live, says lord LORD, I will prepare thee to blood, and blood shall pursue thee. Since thou have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.

7. Thus I will make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation, and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns.

8. And I will fill its mountains with its slain. In thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses they shall fall who are slain with the sword.

9. I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

10. Because thou have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it, whereas LORD was there,

11. therefore, as I live, says lord LORD, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou have shown out of thy hatred against them. And I will make myself known among them when I shall judge thee.

12. And thou shall know that I, LORD, have heard all thy revilings which thou have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate. They are given us to devour.

13. And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me. I have heard it.

14. Thus says lord LORD: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make thee desolate.

15. As thou rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will do to thee. Thou shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it, and they shall know that I am LORD.

## Ezekiel 36

1. And thou, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of LORD.

2. Thus says lord LORD: Because the enemy has said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession,

3. therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says lord LORD: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips o

4. therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of lord LORD. Thus says lord LORD to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have be

5. therefore thus says lord LORD: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, who have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, wit

6. Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne t

7. Therefore thus says lord LORD: I have sworn, [saying], Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame.

8. But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they are at hand to come.

9. For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and ye shall be tilled and sown.

10. And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it, and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.

11. And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited according to your former estate, and will do better [to you] than at your beginnings. And ye shall know that

12. Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel, and they shall possess thee, and thou shall be their inheritance, and thou shall no more henceforth bereave them of sons.

13. Thus says lord LORD: Because they say to you, Thou [O land] are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of thy nation,

14. therefore thou shall no more devour men, nor bereave thy nation any more, says lord LORD.

15. Neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, nor shall thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, nor shall thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, says lord LORD.

16. Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,

17. Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.

18. Therefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.

19. And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their doings.

20. And when they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, These are the people of LORD, and have gone forth out of his land.

21. But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.

22. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says lord LORD: I do not do [this] for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations where ye went.

23. And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them. And the nations shall know that I am LORD, says lord LORD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their ey

24. For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.

25. And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all your idols.

26. I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.

27. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my ordinances, and do them.

28. And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

29. And I will save you from all your uncleannesses. And I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.

30. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may no more receive the reproach of famine among the nations.

31. Then ye shall remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good. And ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

32. I do [this] not for your sake, says lord LORD; be it known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.

33. Thus says lord LORD: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.

34. And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.

35. And they shall say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. And the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.

36. Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, LORD, have built the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate. I, LORD, have spoken it, and I will do it.

37. Thus says lord LORD: For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them. I will increase them with men like a flock.

38. As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am LORD.

## Ezekiel 37

1. The hand of LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones.

2. And he caused me to pass by them round about. And, behold, there were very many in the open valley, and, lo, they were very dry.

3. And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O lord LORD, thou know.

4. Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of LORD.

5. Thus says lord LORD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.

6. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live. And ye shall know that I am LORD.

7. So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.

8. And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them.

9. Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says lord LORD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.

10. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.

11. Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are clean cut off.

12. Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel.

13. And ye shall know that I am LORD when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.

14. And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live. And I will place you in your own land. And ye shall know that I, LORD, have spoken it and performed it, says LORD.

15. The word of LORD came again to me, saying,

16. And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his companions. Then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his

17. And join them one to another into one stick for thyself, that they may become one in thy hand.

18. And when the sons of thy people shall speak to thee, saying, Will thou not show us what thou mean by these?

19. say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one sti

20. And the sticks on which thou write shall be in thy hand before their eyes.

21. And say to them, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land.

22. And I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all. And they shall no more be two nations, nor shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.

23. Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions, but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places in which they have sinned, and will clean

24. And my servant David shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd. They shall also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.

25. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers dwelt. And they shall dwell therein, they, and their sons, and their son's sons, forever. And David my servant shall be their ruler forev

26. Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them, and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.

27. My tabernacle shall also be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

28. And the nations shall know that I am LORD, who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

## Ezekiel 38

1. And the word of LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.

3. And say, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.

4. And I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords,

5. Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet,

6. Gomer, and all his hordes, the house of Togarmah in the outermost parts of the north, and all his hordes, even many peoples with thee.

7. Be thou prepared. Yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled to thee, and be thou a guard to them.

8. After many days thou shall be visited. In the latter years thou shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste, bu

9. And thou shall ascend. Thou shall come like a storm. Thou shall be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee.

10. Thus says lord LORD: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shall devise an evil plan.

11. And thou shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages. I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,

12. to take the spoil and to take the prey, to turn thy hand against the waste places that are [now] inhabited, and against the people who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell in the middle of th

14. Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says lord LORD: In that day when my people Israel dwell securely, shall thou not know it?

15. And thou shall come from thy place out of the outermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army.

16. And thou shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land. It shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Go

17. Thus says lord LORD: Are thou he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for [many] years that I would bring thee against them?

18. And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says lord LORD, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.

19. For I have spoken in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath. Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel,

20. so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men who are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence. And the mo

21. And I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains, says lord LORD. Every man's sword shall be against his brother.

22. And I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and with blood. And I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

23. And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations. And they shall know that I am LORD.

## Ezekiel 39

1. And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says lord LORD: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.

2. And I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the outermost parts of the north, and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.

3. And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

4. Thou shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples who are with thee. I will give thee to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.

5. Thou shall fall upon the open field, for I have spoken it, says lord LORD.

6. And I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely in the isles. And they shall know that I am LORD.

7. And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, nor will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more. And the nations shall know that I am LORD, the Holy One in Israel.

8. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says lord LORD. This is the day of which I have spoken.

9. And those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staves, and the spears. And they shall make fir

10. so that they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests, for they shall make fires of the weapons. And they shall plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them, says lord LORD.

11. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel: the valley of those who pass through on the east of the sea. And it shall stop those who pass through, and they shall bury Gog and all his

12. And the house of Israel shall be burying them seven months, that they may cleanse the land.

13. Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them, and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, says lord LORD.

14. And they shall set apart men of continual employment, who shall pass through the land. And, with those who pass through, those that bury those who remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it, after the end of seven months they

15. And those who pass through the land shall pass through, and when any man sees a man's bone, then he shall set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.

16. And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus they shall cleanse the land.

17. And thou, son of man, thus says lord LORD: Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come. Gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sac

18. Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

19. And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

20. And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, says lord LORD.

21. And I will set my glory among the nations. And all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.

22. So the house of Israel shall know that I am LORD their God, from that day and forward.

23. And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them. So I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of th

24. I did to them according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions. And I hid my face from them.

25. Therefore thus says lord LORD: Now I will bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel. And I will be jealous for my holy name.

26. And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land. And none shall make them afraid

27. when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.

28. And they shall know that I am LORD their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them to their own land. And I will leave none of them any more there,

29. nor will I hide my face any more from them. For I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 40

1. In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of LORD was upon me, and he brought me there

2. He brought me in the visions of God into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, upon which was as it were the frame of a city on the south.

3. And he brought me there, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed. And he stood in the gate.

4. And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee. For thou are brought here to the intent that I may show them to thee. Declare all that thou se

5. And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed, and the height, one ree

6. Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the steps of it. And he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad, and the other threshold, one reed broad.

7. And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad, and [the space] between the little chambers was five cubits. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.

8. He also measured the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.

9. Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and the posts thereof, two cubits. And the porch of the gate was toward the house.

10. And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; those three were of one measure. And the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

11. And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits,

12. and a border before the little chambers, one cubit [on this side], and a border, one cubit on that side, and the little chambers, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

13. And he measured the gate from the roof of the one little chamber to the roof of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits, door against door.

14. He also made posts, sixty cubits. And the court [reached] to the posts, round about the gate.

15. And [from] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.

16. And there were closed windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches. And windows were round about inward, and upon [each] post were palm trees.

17. Then he brought me into the outer court. And, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about; thirty chambers were upon the pavement.

18. And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.

19. Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, a hundred cubits, [both] on the east and on the north.

20. And the gate of the outer court whose view is toward the north, he measured the length of it and the breadth of it.

21. And the little chambers of it were three on this side and three on that side. And the posts of it and the arches of it were according to the measure of the first gate: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five

22. And the windows of it, and the arches of it, and the palm trees of it, were according to the measure of the gate whose view is toward the east. And they went up to it by seven steps, and the arches of it were before them.

23. And there was a gate to the inner court opposite the [other] gate, [both] on the north and on the east, and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.

24. And he led me toward the south. And, behold, a gate toward the south. And he measured the posts of it and the arches of it according to these measures.

25. And there were windows in it, and in the arches of it round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.

26. And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches of it were before them. And it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts of it.

27. And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.

28. Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. And he measured the south gate according to these measures,

29. and the little chambers of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it, according to these measures. And there were windows in it and in the arches of it round about. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits broad.

30. And there were arches round about, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits broad.

31. And the arches of it were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon the posts of it. And the ascent to it had eight steps.

32. And he brought me into the inner court toward the east. And he measured the gate according to these measures,

33. and the little chambers of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it, according to these measures. And there were windows in it and in the arches of it round about. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits broad.

34. And the arches of it were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon the posts of it, on this side, and on that side. And the ascent to it had eight steps.

35. And he brought me to the north gate. And he measured [it] according to these measures,

36. the little chambers of it, the posts of it, and the arches of it. And there were windows in it round about. The length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.

37. And the posts of it were toward the outer court, and palm trees were upon the posts of it, on this side, and on that side. And the ascent to it had eight steps.

38. And a chamber with the door of it was by the posts at the gates. There they washed the burnt-offering.

39. And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to kill on it the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.

40. And on the [one] side outside, at the going up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables, and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.

41. Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables, upon which they killed [the sacrifices].

42. And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, upon which they laid the instruments of which they killed the burnt-offering and the sacri

43. And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened inside round about. And upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.

44. And outside the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate, and their view was toward the south, one at the side of the east gate having the view toward the north.

45. And he said to me, This chamber, whose view is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.

46. And the chamber whose view is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to LORD to minister to him.

47. And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare. And the altar was before the house.

48. Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. And the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.

49. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, even by the steps by which they went up to it. And there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

## Ezekiel 41

1. And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.

2. And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits. And the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side. And he measured the length of it, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.

3. Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits, and the entrance, six cubits, and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.

4. And he measured the length of it, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple. And he said to me, This is the most holy place.

5. Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits, and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.

6. And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order. And they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might be attached [to it], and not be attac

7. And the side-chambers were broader as they circled [the house] higher and higher, for the circling of the house went higher and higher round about the house. Therefore the breadth of the house [continued] upward, and so increased [

8. I also saw that the house had a raised basement round about. The foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.

9. The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits. And that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.

10. And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.

11. And the doors of the side-chambers were toward [the place] that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.

12. And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length of it ninety cubits.

13. So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long, and the separate place, and the building, with the walls of it, a hundred cubits long,

14. also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.

15. And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back of it, and the galleries of it on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, and the inner temple, and the porches of the court,

16. the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, opposite the threshold, paneled with wood round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),

17. to [the space] above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall round about inside and outside, by measure.

18. And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub. And every cherub had two faces,

19. so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side, made through all the house round about.

20. Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. Thus was the wall of the temple.

21. As for the temple, the door-posts were squared. And as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance was as the appearance [of the temple].

22. The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length of it two cubits, and the corners of it, and the length of it, and the walls of it, were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before LORD.

23. And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

24. And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves, two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.

25. And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, just as were made upon the walls. And there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch outside.

26. And there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. Thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.

## Ezekiel 42

1. Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north. And he brought me into the chamber that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north.

2. In front was the north door, the length of a hundred cubits, and the breadth was fifty cubits.

3. Opposite the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.

4. And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit, and their doors were toward the north.

5. Now the upper chambers were shorter, for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.

6. For they were in three stories, and they did not have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore [the uppermost] was narrowed more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

7. And the wall that was outside by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length of it was fifty cubits.

8. For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. And, lo, of those on the front of the temple were a hundred cubits.

9. And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as going into them from the outer court.

10. In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.

11. And the way before them was like the appearance of [the way of] the chambers which were toward the north. According to their length so was their breadth. And all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to t

12. And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as entering into them.

13. Then he said to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near to LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most h

14. When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but they shall lay their garments there in which they minister, for they are holy. And they shall put on other garments, and shall approa

15. Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose view is toward the east, and measured it round about.

16. He measured on the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

17. He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.

18. He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

19. He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

20. He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.

## Ezekiel 43

1. Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east.

2. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. And his voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.

3. And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar. And I fell upon my face

4. And the glory of LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose view is toward the east.

5. And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court, and, behold, the glory of LORD filled the house.

6. And I heard speaking to me out of the house, and a man stood by me.

7. And he said to me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neith

8. in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was [but] the wall between me and them. And they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. The

9. Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.

10. Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the pattern.

11. And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and the fashion of it, and the exits of it, and the entrances of it, and all the forms of it, and all the ordinances of it, and all the fo

12. This is the law of the house. Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit of it round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.

13. And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth). The bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border of it by the edge of it round about a span. And this shall be the base

14. And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit. And from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.

15. And the upper altar shall be four cubits. And from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.

16. And the altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits] long by twelve broad, square in the four sides of it.

17. And the ledge shall be fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it. And the border about it shall be half a cubit, and the bottom of it shall be a cubit round about. And the steps of it shall look toward the ea

18. And he said to me, Son of man, thus says lord LORD: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it.

19. Thou shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me, says lord LORD, a young bullock for a sin-offering.

20. And thou shall take of the blood of it, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about. Thus thou shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.

21. Thou shall also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.

22. And on the second day thou shall offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering. And they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bullock.

23. When thou have made an end of cleansing it, thou shall offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

24. And thou shall bring them near before LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering to LORD.

25. Seven days thou shall prepare each day a goat for a sin-offering. They shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.

26. Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it. So they shall consecrate it.

27. And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings. And I will accept you, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 44

1. Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east. And it was shut.

2. And LORD said to me, This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, nor shall any man enter in by it, for LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it. Therefore it shall be shut.

3. As for the ruler, he shall sit in it as ruler to eat bread before LORD. He shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.

4. Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house. And I looked, and, behold, the glory of LORD filled the house of LORD. And I fell upon my face.

5. And LORD said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of LORD, and all the laws of it. And mark well the entrance of the h

6. And thou shall say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says lord LORD: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,

7. in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood. And they have broken my covenant, [to add

8. And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things, but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

9. Thus says lord LORD: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the sons of Israel.

10. But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.

11. Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house. They shall kill the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to ministe

12. Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up my hand against them, says lord LORD, and they shall bear their iniquity.

13. And they shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy, but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committ

14. Yet I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service of it, and for all that shall be done in it.

15. But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me. And they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat an

16. they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.

17. And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

18. They shall have linen headdresses upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins. They shall not gird themselves with [anything that causes] sweat.

19. And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers. And they shall put on other garments, that they not

20. Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow long. They shall only cut off the hair of their heads.

21. Neither shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter into the inner court.

22. Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is put away, but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.

23. And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

24. And in a controversy they shall stand to judge. They shall judge it according to my ordinances. And they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts, and they shall hallow my Sabbaths.

25. And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves. But for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves.

26. And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.

27. And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, says lord LORD.

28. And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance. And ye shall give them no possession in Israel. I am their possession.

29. They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering. And every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.

30. And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest. Ye shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy h

31. The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.

## Ezekiel 45

1. Moreover, when ye shall divide the land by lot for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to LORD, a holy portion of the land. The length shall be the length of twenty-five thousand [reeds], and the breadth shall be ten thousand.

2. Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred by five hundred square round about, and fifty cubits for the suburbs of it round about.

3. And of this measure thou shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand. And the sanctuary shall be in it, which is most holy.

4. It is a holy portion of the land. It shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to LORD, and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.

5. And twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be to the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession to themselves, [for] twenty chambers.

6. And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and twenty-five thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion. It shall be for the whole house of Israel.

7. And [whatever is] for the ruler [shall be] on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side wes

8. It shall be to him for a possession in the land in Israel. And my rulers shall no more oppress my people, but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.

9. Thus says lord LORD: Let it suffice you, O rulers of Israel. Remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness. Take away your exactions from my people, says lord LORD.

10. Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

11. The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer. The measure of it shall be according to the homer.

12. And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

13. This is the oblation that ye shall offer: The sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley,

14. and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, [which is] ten baths, even a homer, (for ten baths are a homer),

15. and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel, for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, says lord LORD.

16. All the people of the land shall give to this oblation for the ruler in Israel.

17. And it shall be the ruler's part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He shall p

18. Thus says lord LORD: In the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, thou shall take a young bullock without blemish, and thou shall cleanse the sanctuary.

19. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.

20. And so thou shall do on the seventh [day] of the month for each one who errs, and for him who is simple. So shall ye make atonement for the house.

21. In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days. Unleavened bread shall be eaten.

22. And upon that day the ruler shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.

23. And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days, and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.

24. And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

25. In the seventh [month], in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, he shall do the like the seven days, according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the

## Ezekiel 46

1. Thus says lord LORD: The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days, but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.

2. And the ruler shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and shall stand by the post of the gate. And the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the

3. And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before LORD on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.

4. And the burnt-offering that the ruler shall offer to LORD shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish,

5. and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

6. And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without blemish.

7. And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

8. And when the ruler shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way of it.

9. But when the people of the land shall come before LORD in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate, and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall

10. And the ruler, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them, and when they go forth, they shall go forth [together].

11. And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

12. And when the ruler shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering to LORD, a man shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east. And he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his

13. And thou shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering to LORD daily. Thou shall prepare it morning by morning.

14. And thou shall prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour, a meal-offering to LORD continually by a perpetual ordinance.

15. Thus they shall prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.

16. Thus says lord LORD: If the ruler gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It shall belong to his sons. It is their possession by inheritance.

17. But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty, then it shall return to the ruler. But as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.

18. Moreover the ruler shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession. He shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered each man from his possession.

19. Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north. And, behold, there was a place on the rear part westward.

20. And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, [and] where they shall bake the meal-offering, that they not bring them forth into the outer court, to sanctify the peopl

21. Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court. And, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.

22. In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty [cubits] long and thirty broad. These four in the corners were of one measure.

23. And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four. And boiling-places were made under the walls round about.

24. Then said he to me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

## Ezekiel 47

1. And he brought me back to the door of the house. And, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house was toward the east. And the waters came down from under, from the right

2. Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of [the gate] that looks toward the east. And, behold, waters ran out on the right side.

3. When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.

4. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins.

5. Afterward he measured a thousand, [and it was] a river that I could not pass through, for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.

6. And he said to me, Son of man, have thou seen [this]? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.

7. Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.

8. Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah. And they shall go toward the sea, into the sea which were made to issue forth, and the waters shall be healed.

9. And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, shall live. And there shall be a very great multitude of fish (for these waters have come there) and shall be healed. And eve

10. And it shall come to pass, that fishermen shall stand by it. From En-gedi even to En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, very many.

11. But the miry places of it, and the marshes of it, shall not be healed. They shall be given up to salt.

12. And by the river upon the bank of it, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, nor shall the fruit of it fail. It shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters of it

13. Thus says lord LORD: This shall be the border by which ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph [shall have two] portions.

14. And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, for I swore to give it to your fathers. And this land shall fall to you for inheritance.

15. And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad,

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.

17. And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.

18. And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan, from the [north] border to the east sea ye shall measure. This is the east side.

19. And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea. This is the south side southward.

20. And the west side shall be the great sea, from the [south] border as far as opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.

21. So ye shall divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.

22. And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the strangers who sojourn among you, who shall beget sons among you. And they shall be to you as the home-born among the sons of Israel; the

23. And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns, there ye shall give him his inheritance, says lord LORD.

## Ezekiel 48

1. Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they shall have their sides east [and] west), Dan,

7. And by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one [portion].

8. And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer: twenty-five thousand [reeds] in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side to the west side. And th

9. The oblation that ye shall offer to LORD shall be twenty-five thousand [reeds] in length, and ten thousand in breadth.

10. And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy oblation: toward the north twenty-five thousand [in length], and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south twen

11. [It shall be] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

12. And it shall be to them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.

13. And answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth. All the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.

14. And they shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated, for it is holy to LORD.

15. And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs. And the city shall be in the midst of it.

16. And these shall be the measures of it: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five

17. And the city shall have suburbs: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.

18. And the residue in the length, answerable to the holy oblation, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward. And it shall be answerable to the holy oblation. And the increase of it shall be for food to those who labor

19. And those who labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it.

20. All the oblation shall be twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand. Ye shall offer the holy oblation four-square, with the possession of the city.

21. And the residue shall be for the ruler, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the twenty-five thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of

22. Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the ruler's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the ruler.

23. And as for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one [portion].

24. And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one [portion].

25. And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one [portion].

28. And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea.

29. This is the land which ye shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, says lord LORD.

30. And these are the exits of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure.

31. And the gates of the city shall be according to the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one, the gate of Judah, one, the gate of Levi, one.

32. And at the east side four thousand and five hundred [reeds], and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one, the gate of Benjamin, one, the gate of Dan, one.
