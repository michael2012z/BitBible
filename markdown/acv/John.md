# John

## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2. This man was in the beginning with God.

3. All things came to be through him, and apart from him not even one thing came to be that has come to be.

4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.

5. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.

6. A man came to be who was sent from God, his name was John.

7. This man came for testimony so that he might testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.

8. That man was not the light, but that he might testify about the light.

9. He was the TRUE light coming into the world that enlightens every man.

10. He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, and the world knew him not.

11. He came to his own, and his own did not accept him.

12. But as many as did accept him, to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,

13. who were begotten, not from blood, nor from a will of flesh, nor from a will of man, but from God.

14. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.

15. John testified about him, and cried out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me came to be before me, because he was before me.

16. And from his fullness we all received, even grace for grace.

17. Because the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came to be through Jesus Christ.

18. No man has ever seen God. The only begotten Son, being in the bosom of the Father, that man reported him.

19. And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, Who are thou?

20. And he confessed, and did not deny, and confessed, I am not the Christ.

21. And they asked him, What therefore, are thou Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are thou the prophet? And he answered, No.

22. They said therefore to him, Who are thou, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do thou say about thyself?

23. He said, I am the voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of Lord, just as the prophet Isaiah said.

24. And those who were sent were from the Pharisees.

25. And they asked him, and said to him, Why therefore do thou immerse if thou are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?

26. John answered them, saying, I immerse in water, but amidst you stands him whom ye know not.

27. He is the man who comes after me, who has become before me, of whom I am not worthy that I might loosen the strap of his shoe.

28. These things occurred in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was immersing.

29. On the morrow John sees Jesus coming to him, and he says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!

30. This is he about whom I said, After me comes a man who has become before me, because he was before me.

31. And I had not known him, but that he would be made known to Israel. Because of this I came immersing in water.

32. And John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.

33. And I had not known him. But he who sent me to immerse in water, he said to me, Upon whomever thou will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, this is he who immerses in Holy Spirit.

34. And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.

35. Again on the morrow John stood, and two of his disciples.

36. And having looked upon Jesus walking, he says, Behold, the Lamb of God!

37. And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.

38. And Jesus having turned, and having seen them following, says to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi (which says, being interpreted, Teacher), where do thou dwell?

39. He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and remained with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.

40. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard from John and who followed him.

41. This man first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).

42. And he brought him to Jesus. And having seen him, Jesus said, Thou are Simon the son of Jonah. Thou will be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).

43. On the morrow he wanted to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip. And Jesus says to him, Follow me.

44. Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets wrote: Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.

46. And Nathanael said to him, What good can be from Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says about him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit.

48. Nathanael says to him, How do thou know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.

49. Nathanael answered, and says to him, Rabbi, thou are the Son of God. Thou are the king of Israel.

50. Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believe? Thou will see greater than these things.

51. And he says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, henceforth ye will see the heaven opened, and the agents of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

## John 2

1. And the third day a wedding occurred in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.

2. And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the wedding.

3. And having lacked wine the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.

4. And Jesus says to her, What is with me and with thee, woman? My hour is not yet here.

5. His mother says to the helpers, Whatever he may say to you, do.

6. Now there were six stone water pots laying there in accordance with the purification of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.

7. Jesus says to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them until over.

8. And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry to the feast-ruler. And they carried.

9. And when the feast-ruler tasted the water that became wine, and had not known from where it was (but the helpers who drew the water had known), the feast-ruler called the bridegroom,

10. and says to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they drank much, then the lesser. Thou have kept the good wine until now.

11. This is the beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.

12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples. And they remained there not many days.

13. And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14. And he found sitting in the temple those who sell oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers.

15. And having made a whip from cords, he drove all out from the temple, both the sheep and the oxen. And he poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and turned over their tables.

16. And he said to those who sell the doves, Take these things from here. Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.

17. And his disciples remembered that it is written, Zeal for thy house will consume me.

18. The Jews therefore answered, and said to him, What sign do thou show us since thou do these things?

19. Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

20. The Jews therefore said, This temple was forty-six years being built, and will thou raise it up in three days?

21. But that man spoke about the temple of his body.

22. When therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he spoke this, and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus said.

23. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast, many believed in his name seeing his signs that he did.

24. But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,

25. and because he had no need that any man should testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man.

## John 3

1. Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

2. This man came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou have come a teacher from God, for no man can do these signs that thou do if God is not with him.

3. Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to thee, If any man is not begotten from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

4. Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be begotten, being old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's belly, and be born?

5. Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to thee, If any man is not begotten from water and Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

6. That which is begotten from the flesh is flesh, and that which is begotten from the Spirit is spirit.

7. Marvel not that I said to thee, ye must be begotten from above.

8. The wind blows where it will, and thou hear the sound of it, but know not from where it comes, and where it goes. So is every man who is begotten from the Spirit.

9. Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things happen?

10. Jesus answered and said to him, Thou are the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?

11. Truly, truly, I say to thee, we speak that which we know, and testify of what we have seen, and ye do not accept our testimony.

12. If I told you earthly things, and ye do not believe, how will ye believe if I should tell you heavenly things?

13. And no man has ascended into heaven, except he who came down out of heaven: the Son of man who is in heaven.

14. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,

15. so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but may have eternal life.

16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but have eternal life.

17. For God sent the Son into the world not that he might condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.

18. He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil.

20. For every man who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, so that his works may not be exposed.

21. But he who does the truth comes to the light, so that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.

22. After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the Jewish land. And he remained there with them and immersed.

23. And John also was immersing in Aenon near Salim because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed.

24. For John was not yet cast into prison.

25. Therefore a debate developed from John's disciples with the Jews about purification.

26. And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, about whom thou have testified, behold, this man immerses, and all men come to him.

27. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven.

28. Ye yourselves testify that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent ahead of that man.

29. He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This therefore my joy is fulfilled.

30. It is necessary for that man to increase, but me to decrease.

31. He who comes from above is above all things. He who is of the earth is of the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all things.

32. And what he has seen and heard, of this he testifies, and no man receives his testimony.

33. He who has received his testimony has set a seal that God is true.

34. For he whom God sent speaks the sayings of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.

35. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.

36. He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.

## John 4

1. When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and immersing more disciples than John

2. (although Jesus himself did not immerse, but his disciples),

3. he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.

4. And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.

5. So he comes to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the place that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. And Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied from the journey, thus was sitting on the well. It was about the sixth hour.

7. A woman of Samaria comes to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.

8. For his disciples had gone away into the city so that they might buy food.

9. The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How do thou, being Jewish, ask to drink from me, being a Samaritan woman, for Jews do not associate with Samaritans?

10. Jesus answered and said to her, If thou had known the gift of God, and who it is who says to thee, Give me to drink, thou would have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.

11. The woman says to him, Sir, thou have not even a container, and the well is deep. From where then have thou the living water?

12. Are thou greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his livestock?

13. Jesus answered and said to her, Every man who drinks of this water will thirst again,

14. but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will, no, not thirst into the age. But the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.

15. The woman says to him, Give me this water, sir, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw out.

16. Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.

17. The woman answered and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Thou said correctly, I have no husband.

18. For thou have had five husbands, and he whom thou now have is not thy husband. This thou have said true.

19. The woman says to him, Sir, I perceive that thou are a prophet.

20. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.

21. Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour is coming when neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem will ye worship the Father.

22. Ye worship what ye do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.

23. But an hour comes, and now is, when the TRUE worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for also the Father seeks such kind who worship him.

24. God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.

25. The woman says to him, I know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When that man comes he will declare all things to us.

26. Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am the man.

27. And upon this his disciples came. And they marveled that he spoke with the woman, yet no man said, What seek thou? or, Why do thou speak with her?

28. The woman therefore left her water pot, and departed into the city, and says to the men,

29. Come, see a man who told me all, as many things as I did. Is not this the Christ?

30. They went out of the city, and came to him.

31. In the meanwhile the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.

32. But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not.

33. The disciples therefore said to each other, Did any man bring him to eat?

34. Jesus says to them, My food is that I do the will of him who sent me, and may finish his work.

35. Do ye not say, There are still four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, that they are already white for harvest.

36. And he who reaps receives a wage and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.

37. For in this the saying is true, One is who sows, and another who reaps.

38. I sent you to reap what ye have not labored. Others have labored, and ye have entered into their labor.

39. And many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all, as many things as I did.

40. So when the Samaritans came to him they asked him to remain with them, and he remained there two days.

41. And many more believed because of his word.

42. And they said to the woman, We no longer believe because of thy speaking, for we have heard ourselves, and know that this really is the Savior of the world, the Christ.

43. And after the two days he departed from there and went into Galilee.

44. For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own fatherland.

45. So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.

46. Jesus therefore came again to Cana of Galilee where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.

47. This man having heard that Jesus comes out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was going to die.

48. Jesus therefore said to him, Unless may ye see signs and wonders, ye will, no, not believe.

49. The nobleman says to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.

50. Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and he departed.

51. And as he was now going down, his bondmen met him and reported, saying, Thy boy lives.

52. So he inquired of them the hour in which he fared well. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

53. So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives. And he himself believed and his whole house.

54. This again is a second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.

## John 5

1. After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2. Now there is in Jerusalem by the place pertaining to sheep, a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.

3. In these lay a great multitude of those who are feeble, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the movement of the water.

4. For a heavenly agent went down at a certain time into the pool, and agitated the water. Therefore the first man who stepped in after the agitation of the water became well from whatever affliction he had.

5. And a certain man was there who was thirty-eight years in the weakness.

6. When Jesus saw this man laying down, and knew that he fares now a long time, he says to him, Do thou desire to become well?

7. The infirmed man answered him, Sir, I have no man so that when the water is agitated he might put me into the pool, but while I am coming another steps down before me.

8. Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy bed and walk.

9. And straightaway the man became well, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was Sabbath on that day.

10. The Jews therefore said to the man who was cured, It is Sabbath. It is not permitted for thee to take up the bed.

11. He answered them, The man who made me well, that man said to me, Take up thy bed and walk.

12. Therefore they asked him, Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?

13. But the man who was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus withdrew, a multitude being in the place.

14. After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou have become well. Sin no more, lest something worse may happen to thee.

15. The man departed and reported to the Jews that Jesus is the man who made him well.

16. And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on a Sabbath.

17. But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now and I work.

18. Because of this therefore the Jews sought even more to kill him, because not only did he relax the Sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.

19. Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever he may do, the Son also does these things in like manner.

20. For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. And he will show him works greater works than these, so that ye may marvel.

21. For as the Father raises up the dead and makes alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.

22. For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son,

23. so that all would honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. The man not honoring the Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, that he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life. And he does not come into condemnation, but has passed from death into life.

25. Truly, truly, I say to you, that an hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.

26. For as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to the Son to have life in himself.

27. And he also gave him authority to execute judgment because he is a son of man.

28. Marvel not at this, because an hour comes in which all those in the sepulchers will hear his voice,

29. and will come forth, those who have done right to a resurrection of life, and those who have practiced wrong to a resurrection of judgment.

30. I can from myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge. And my judgment is righteous because I seek not my will, but the will of the Father who sent me.

31. If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.

32. There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony that he testifies about me is valid.

33. Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.

34. But I do not take the testimony from man. However, I say these things, so that ye may be saved.

35. That man was the lamp that burns and shines, and ye were willing to rejoice for an hour in his light.

36. But I have testimony greater than of John, for the works that the Father has given me so that I might complete them, the same works that I do, they testify about me that the Father has sent me.

37. And the Father, he who sent me, has testified about me.Ye have neither heard his voice, nor have ever seen his appearance.

38. And ye have not his word dwelling in you, because ye do not believe that man whom he sent for this.

39. Ye search the scriptures, because ye think to have eternal life in them, and those are testifying about me.

40. And ye will not come to me, so that ye may have life.

41. I do not receive glory from men.

42. But I know you, that ye have not the love of God within yourselves.

43. I have come in my Father's name, and ye do not accept me. If another man should come in his own name, ye will accept that man.

44. How can ye believe, who receive glory from each other, and seek not the glory from the only God?

45. Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. The man who accuses you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.

46. For if ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for that man wrote about me.

47. But if ye believe not the writings of that man, how will ye believe my sayings?

## John 6

1. After these things Jesus went to the other side of the sea of Galilee of Tiberias.

2. And a great multitude followed him because they saw his signs, which he did on those who are infirmed.

3. And Jesus went up onto the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.

4. Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.

5. Jesus therefore having lifted up his eyes, and having seen that a great multitude comes to him, he says to Philip, From where will we buy loaves, so that these may eat?

6. But he said this testing him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.

7. Philip answered him, Loaves of two hundred denarii of bread are not sufficient for them, so that each of them may take a little something.

8. One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,

9. There is one child here that has five barley loaves and two fishes, but what are these for so many?

10. And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.

11. And Jesus took the loaves, and having expressed thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, likewise also of the fishes as much as they wanted.

12. And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain over, so that not anything may be lost.

13. So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves that remained over from those who have eaten.

14. When therefore the men saw what sign Jesus did, they said, This really is the prophet who comes into the world.

15. Jesus therefore having perceived that they are going to come and seize him, so that they might make him king, departed onto the mountain himself alone.

16. And when it became evening his disciples went down to the sea,

17. and having entered into the boat, they were going to the other side of the sea toward Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them.

18. And the sea was being raised by a great wind blowing.

19. Therefore having impelled forward about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near to the boat, and they were afraid.

20. But he says to them, It is I, fear not.

21. They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat, and straightaway the boat came to be at the land to which they were going.

22. On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there except that one in which his disciples entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but his

23. and other boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord expressed thanks,

24. when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they entered into the boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

25. And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did thou become here?

26. Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.

27. Work not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for God the Father put a seal on this man.

28. They said to him therefore, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?

29. Jesus answered, and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in that man whom he has sent.

30. They said to him therefore, What sign do thou, that we may see and believe in thee? What do thou work?

31. Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.

32. Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the TRUE bread out of heaven.

33. For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.

34. They said to him therefore, Lord, always give us this bread.

35. Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will, no, not hunger, and he who believes in me will, no, not ever thirst.

36. But also I said to you, that ye have seen me, and yet do not believe.

37. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will, no, not cast out.

38. Because I have come down from heaven, not so that I might do my will, but the will of him who sent me.

39. And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all that he has given me I would not lose from it, but I will raise it up at the last day.

40. And this is the will of him who sent me, that every man who sees the Son, and believes in him, may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

41. The Jews therefore murmured about him because he said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.

42. And they said, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? Therefore how does this man say, I have come down out of heaven?

43. Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among each other.

44. No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.

45. It is written in the prophets, And they will all be taught of God. Every man who hears from the Father, and having learned, comes to me.

46. Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God. This man has seen the Father.

47. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me has eternal life.

48. I am the bread of life.

49. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.

50. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.

51. I am the living bread, having come down out of heaven. If any man eats of this bread, he will live into the age. And also, the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

52. The Jews therefore contended with each other, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

53. Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.

54. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

55. For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.

56. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me, and I in him.

57. Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, also he who eats me, that man will also live because of me.

58. This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live into the age.

59. He said these things in a synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

60. Therefore many of his disciples having heard, said, This is a hard saying. Who can listen to it?

61. But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples are grumbling about this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble?

62. Then if ye should see the Son of man ascending where he was before?

63. It is the spirit that makes alive. The flesh benefits nothing. The sayings that I speak to you are spirit, are life.

64. Nevertheless, there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who do not believe, and who he is who will betray him.

65. And he said, Because of this I have said to you that no man is able to come to me, if it is not given to him from my Father.

66. From this, many of his disciples went back at these things, and walked no more with him.

67. Jesus said therefore to the twelve, Do ye not also want to go?

68. Simon Peter therefore answered him, Lord, to whom will we go? Thou have sayings of eternal life.

69. And we have believed and know that thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

70. Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?

71. But he spoke of Judas Iscariot son of Simon. For this man, being one of the twelve, was going to betray him.

## John 7

1. And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.

2. Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was near.

3. His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea so that thy disciples also may see thy works that thou do.

4. For no man does anything in secret, and he himself seeks to be in public. If thou do these things, show thyself to the world.

5. For not even his brothers believed in him.

6. Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet here, but your time is always ready.

7. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it, that its works are evil.

8. Go ye up to this feast. I am not yet going to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.

9. And having said these things to them, he remained in Galilee.

10. But when his brothers went up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in private.

11. The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is that man?

12. And there was much murmuring among the multitudes about him. Some said, He is a good man, others said, No, but he leads the multitude astray.

13. Yet no man spoke openly about him because of fear of the Jews.

14. And when it was now in the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.

15. The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know scholarly material, not having learned?

16. Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.

17. If any man wants to do his will, he will know about the doctrine, whether it is from God, or I speak from myself.

18. He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, this man is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.

19. Did not Moses give you the law, and none of you does the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?

20. The multitude answered and said, Thou have a demon. Who seeks to kill thee?

21. Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because of this.

22. Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and ye circumcise a man on a Sabbath.

23. If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath, so that the law of Moses may not be loosed, are ye angry with me because I made a man entirely well on a Sabbath?

24. Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

25. Therefore some of the Jerusalemites said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?

26. And lo, he speaks in public, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers really know that this really is the Christ?

27. However we know this man, where he is from, but when the Christ comes, no man knows where he is from.

28. Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know where I am from? And I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom ye know not.

29. I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.

30. They sought therefore to seize him, and yet no man laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.

31. But many from the crowd believed in him, and they said, When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these that this man did?

32. The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent subordinates so that they might take him.

33. Jesus therefore said, Yet a little time I am with you, and then I go to him who sent me.

34. Ye will seek me, and will not find me, and where I am, ye cannot come.

35. The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where is this man going to go that we will not find him? Is he going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

36. What is this word that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me, and, Where I am, ye cannot come?

37. Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus had stood and cried out, saying, If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink.

38. He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.

39. But he spoke this about the Spirit that those who believe in him were going to receive, for Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

40. Many from the multitude therefore, when they heard the saying, said, This is truly the prophet.

41. Others said, This is the Christ. Others said, For does the Christ come out of Galilee?

42. Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?

43. So there became a division among the multitude because of him.

44. And some of them wanted to taken him, but no man laid hands on him.

45. The subordinates therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And those men said to them, Why did ye not bring him?

46. The subordinates answered, A man never so spoke like this man.

47. The Pharisees therefore answered them, Have ye not also been led astray?

48. Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?

49. But this multitude that does not know the law are accursed.

50. Nicodemus says to them (he who came to him by night, being one of them),

51. Does our law judge a man, unless it first may hear from himself and know what he does?

52. They answered and said to him, Are thou also from Galilee? Search and see, that out of Galilee arises no prophet.

53. And each man went to his house.

## John 8

1. But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.

2. And at early morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. And having sat down, he taught them.

3. And the scholars and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery. And having stood her in the midst,

4. tempting, they say to him, Teacher, we found this woman committing adultery, in the act.

5. Now in the law, Moses commanded us such women are to be stoned. What therefore do thou say about her?

6. But they said this, trying him, so that they might have an accusation against him. But Jesus having stooped down, wrote on the ground with his finger, not pretending.

7. And when they continued asking him, after standing erect, he said to them, Let the innocent man of you first cast the stone at her.

8. And again having stooped down, he wrote on the ground.

9. And they, having heard and being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, having begun from the elder until the last. And Jesus was left behind alone, and the woman being in the midst.

10. And Jesus, after standing erect, and having seen no man but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those accusers of thee? Did no man condemn thee?

11. And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and henceforth sin no more.

12. Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me would, no, not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.

13. The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testify about thyself. Thy testimony is not valid.

14. Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I might testify about myself, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I go, but ye do not know where I come from and where I go.

15. Ye judge according to the flesh. I judge no man.

16. But even if I judge, my judgment is valid, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.

17. And also it is written in your law that the testimony of two men is valid.

18. I am he who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.

19. They said therefore to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.

20. Jesus spoke these sayings in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no man seized him, because his hour had not yet come.

21. Jesus therefore again said to them, I go, and ye will seek me, and ye will die in your sin. Where I go, ye cannot come.

22. The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, because he says, Where I go, ye cannot come?

23. And he said to them, Ye are from below, I am from above. Ye are of this world, I am not of this world.

24. I said therefore to you that ye will die in your sins. For unless ye believe that I am he, ye will die in your sins.

25. They said therefore to him, Who are thou? And Jesus said to them, The beginning, something that I am even telling you.

26. I have many things to say and to judge about you. But he who sent me is true, and I speak to the world these things that I heard from him.

27. They did not understand that he spoke the Father to them.

28. Jesus therefore said to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye will know that I am he, and I do nothing from myself, but I speak these things as my Father taught me.

29. And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do things pleasing to him.

30. As he spoke these things of him, many believed in him.

31. Jesus therefore said to those Jews who believed him, If ye remain in my word, ye are truly my disciples,

32. and ye will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.

33. They answered to him, We are Abraham's seed, and have been in bondage to no man, ever. How can thou say, Ye will become free?

34. Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, that every man who does the sin is a bondman of the sin.

35. And the bondman does not remain in the house into the age. The Son remains into the age.

36. If therefore the Son should make you free, ye will truly be free.

37. I know that ye are Abraham's seed, yet ye seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.

38. I speak what I have seen from my Father, and ye therefore do what ye have seen from your father.

39. They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.

40. But now ye seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.

41. Ye do the works of your father. They said therefore to him, We were not begotten from fornication. We have one Father, God.

42. Therefore Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I came forth and have come from God. For, neither have I come for myself, but he sent me.

43. Why do ye not understand my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word.

44. Ye are from the father, the devil, and ye want to do the desires of your father. He was a man-killer from the beginning, and he has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his

45. And I, because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me.

46. Which of you convicts me about sin? And if I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?

47. He who is of God hears the sayings of God. Because of this ye do not hear, because ye are not of God.

48. Therefore the Jews answered and said to him, Do we not say well that thou are a Samaritan, and have a demon?

49. Jesus answered, I have no demon, but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.

50. But I seek not my own glory. He is who seeks and judges.

51. Truly, truly, I say to you, if any man keeps my word, he will, no, not see death, into the age.

52. The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets, and thou say, If any man keeps my word, he will, no, not taste of death, into the age.

53. Are thou greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died. Who do thou make thyself?

54. Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. My Father is he who glorifies me, of whom ye say, He is our God.

55. And ye do not know him, but I know him. And if I should say that I do not know him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.

56. Your father Abraham rejoiced that he could see my day, and he saw it, and was glad.

57. The Jews therefore said to him, Thou have not yet fifty years, and thou have seen Abraham?

58. Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came to be, I am.

59. Therefore they took up stones so that they might throw at him, but Jesus was hid, and went out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and thus passed on.

## John 9

1. And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth.

2. And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?

3. Jesus answered, Neither this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him.

4. I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. Night comes when no man can work.

5. When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

6. Having said these things, he spat toward the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man.

7. And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is translated, He who has been sent). Therefore he went and washed, and came seeing.

8. The neighbors therefore and those who saw him formerly, that he was blind, said, Is this not he who sits and begs?

9. Others said, He is this man, but others said, He is like him. That man said, I am.

10. They said to him therefore, How were thine eyes opened?

11. That man answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and rubbed on my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And after going and washing, I received sight.

12. Therefore they said to him, Where is that man? He says, I do not know.

13. They brought him to the Pharisees--the former blind man.

14. Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

15. Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received sight. And he said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.

16. Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath. Other men said, How is a sinful man able to do such signs? And there was division among them.

17. They say again to the blind man, What do thou say about him, that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.

18. The Jews therefore did not believe about him, that he had been blind, and had received sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received sight.

19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?

20. And his parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind,

21. but how he now sees, we know not. Or who opened his eyes, we know not. He has maturity, ask him. He will speak for himself.

22. His parents spoke these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man confessed him as Christ, he should become excommunicated from the synagogue.

23. Because of this his parents said, He has maturity, ask him.

24. So they called the man who was blind, for a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is sinful.

25. That man therefore answered and said, If he is sinful, I know not. One thing I know, that being blind, now I see.

26. But again they said to him, What did he do to thee? How did he open thine eyes?

27. He answered them, I told you already, and ye did not listen. Why do ye want to hear it again? Do ye not also want to become his disciples?

28. They reviled him, and said, Thou are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses.

29. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but this man, we know not where he is from.

30. The man answered and said to them, For in this it is amazing, that ye know not where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.

31. And we know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any man is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to this man.

32. From the age, it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of a man who was born blind.

33. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.

34. They answered and said to him, Thou were born entirely in sins, and thou teach us. And they cast him outside.

35. Jesus heard that they cast him outside. And having found him, he said to him, Do thou believe in the Son of God?

36. That man answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?

37. And Jesus said to him, Thou have both seen him, and he is that man who speaks with thee.

38. And he affirmed, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.

39. And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, so that those not seeing might see, and those who see might become blind.

40. And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we also blind?

41. Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin, but now ye say, We see, therefore your sin remains.

## John 10

1. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter in by the door into the fold of the sheep, but goes up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber.

2. But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

3. The gatekeeper opens to this man. And the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.

4. And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them. And the sheep follow him because they know his voice.

5. And they will, no, not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.

6. Jesus spoke this allegory to them, but those men did not understand what it was that he spoke to them.

7. Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, that I am the door of the sheep.

8. All, as many as came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.

9. I am the door. If any man enters in by me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and will find pasture.

10. The thief comes not, except that he might steal and kill and destroy. I came so that they might have life, and have it more abundantly.

11. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

12. But the hired man, and not being the shepherd, whose sheep are not his own, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees. And the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.

13. But the hireling flees because he is a hireling, and it is no care to him about the sheep.

14. I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and I am known by mine,

15. just as the Father knows me, I also know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.

16. And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring those also, and they will hear my voice. And there will become one flock, one shepherd.

17. Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, so that I may take it again.

18. No man takes it from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.

19. Therefore again there became a division among the Jews because of these words.

20. And many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad. Why do ye listen to him?

21. Others said, These are not the sayings of a man possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?

22. And the feast of the dedication happened at Jerusalem, and it was winter.

23. And Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.

24. The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, When do thou lift up our soul? If thou are the Christ, tell us plainly.

25. Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye did not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me.

26. But ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.

27. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

28. And I give them eternal life, and they will, no, not perish into the age, and not any will snatch them out of my hand.

29. My Father who has given to me, is greater than all, and not one is able to snatch out of my Father's hand.

30. I and the Father are one.

31. Therefore again the Jews took up stones so that they might stone him.

32. Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father. Because of them, which work do ye stone me?

33. The Jews answered him, saying, We stone thee not about a good work, but about blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, make thyself God.

34. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?

35. If he designated those men gods, for whom the word of God came to be (and the scripture cannot be broken),

36. whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, do ye say, Thou blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?

37. If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.

38. But if I am doing them, even though ye do not believe me, believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the him.

39. Therefore they sought again to take him, and he went forth out of their hand.

40. And he departed again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was first immersing, and he stayed there.

41. And many came to him, and they said, John indeed did not one sign, but all, as many things as John spoke about this man, were true.

42. And many believed in him there.

## John 11

1. Now a certain Lazarus, from Bethany of the village of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.

2. And Mary was the woman who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

3. The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou love is sick.

4. But when Jesus heard, he said, This sickness is not about death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.

5. Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

6. When therefore he heard that he is sick, then he actually remained two days in that place he was.

7. Later after this he says to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.

8. The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews were now seeking to stone thee, and thou go there again.

9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.

10. But if any man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.

11. He spoke these things, and after this he says to them, Our friend Lazarus has become asleep, but I go that I may awake him.

12. His disciples therefore said, Lord, if he has become asleep, he will be healed.

13. But Jesus had spoken about his death, but those men thought that he was speaking about the restfulness of sleep.

14. Therefore Jesus then said to them plainly, Lazarus died.

15. And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that ye may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.

16. Therefore Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

17. So when Jesus came, he found him already four days being kept in the sepucher.

18. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs away from it,

19. and many of the Jews had come to the women, about Martha and Mary, so that they might console them about their brother.

20. Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him, but Mary was sitting in the house.

21. Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if thou were here, my brother would not have died.

22. But I know even now that as many things as thou may ask of God, God will give to thee.

23. Jesus says to her, Thy brother will rise.

24. Martha says to him, I know that he will rise in the resurrection at the last day.

25. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, even though he died, he will live.

26. And every man who lives and believes in me will, no, not die, into the age. Do thou believe this?

27. She says to him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that thou are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.

28. And when she said these things, she departed and called Mary her sister privately, saying, The teacher is here and calls thee.

29. When that woman heard, she rises quickly, and comes to him.

30. (Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.)

31. The Jews therefore being with her in the house and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying that she was going to the sepulcher that she may weep there.

32. Therefore when Mary came where Jesus was, after seeing him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou were here, my brother would not have died.

33. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who gathered with her, weeping, he groaned in the spirit, and was himself troubled.

34. And he said, Where have ye laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see.

35. Jesus wept.

36. The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him.

37. But some of them said, This man who opened the eyes of the blind man, was he not also able to cause that this man also would not die?

38. Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the sepulcher. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.

39. Jesus says, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of the man who came to end, says to him, Lord, he smells now, for is the fourth day.

40. Jesus says to her, Did I not to say thee, that if thou believed, thou will see the glory of God?

41. So they took away the stone where the man who died was laying. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heard me.

42. And I had known that thou always hear me, but because of the multitude that stands by I spoke, so that they may believe that thou sent me.

43. And having said these things, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.

44. And the man who died came forth, wrapped hands and feet with grave-clothes, and his face had been wrapped around with a face cloth. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and allow him to go.

45. Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and who saw what Jesus did, believed in him.

46. But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus did.

47. Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we doing? Because this man does many signs.

48. If we allow him this way, all men will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and the nation.

49. And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all,

50. nor do ye consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not the whole nation should perish.

51. Now he said this not from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation.

52. And not for the nation only, but also that he might gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.

53. So from that day they consulted together so that they might kill him.

54. Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the region near the wilderness into a city called Ephraim, and he stayed there with his disciples.

55. Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the countryside before the Passover, so that they might purify themselves.

56. Therefore they sought Jesus, and spoke with each other as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you? That he will, no, not come to the feast?

57. Now also the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that if any man knew where he is, he should disclose it, so that they might take him.

## John 12

1. Therefore six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, the man who died whom he raised from the dead.

2. So they made a supper for him there, and Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those who sat dining with him.

3. Mary therefore, after taking a pound of ointment of very costly genuine spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled of the aroma of the ointment.

4. Therefore one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, the man who was going to betray him, says,

5. Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?

6. Now he said this, not because it was a concern to him about the poor, but because he was a thief, and he had the purse and removed things that were put in.

7. Jesus therefore said, Let her alone. She has keep it for the day of my burial.

8. For ye always have the poor with you, but ye do not always have me.

9. Therefore a great multitude of the Jews knew that he is there. And they came, not only because of Jesus, but that they might also see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.

10. But the chief priests decided that they should kill Lazarus also,

11. since because of him many of the Jews were going and were believing in Jesus.

12. On the morrow a great multitude having come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

13. took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Lord, the King of Israel!

14. And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written,

15. Fear not, daughter of Zion. Behold, thy King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.

16. Now his disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these were things written because of him, and they did these things to him.

17. Therefore the multitude, the one that was with him when he called Lazarus from the sepulcher, and raised him from the dead, testified.

18. Also because of this the multitude met him, because they heard of him doing this sign.

19. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do ye see that ye accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.

20. Now some Greeks were from those who came up so that they might worship at the feast.

21. These men therefore came to Philip, the man from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.

22. Philip comes and tells Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.

23. And Jesus answered them saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat that falls into the ground dies, it remains alone, but if it dies it bears much fruit.

25. He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

26. If any man serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my helper will also be. And if any man serves me, the Father will value him.

27. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But because of this I came to this hour.

28. Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came out of heaven, saying, I both glorified it, and I will glorify again.

29. The multitude therefore that stood by and heard, said thunder occurred, others said, A heavenly agent has spoken to him.

30. Jesus answered and said, This voice occurred not for my sake, but for your sakes.

31. Now is the judgment of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out.

32. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself.

33. And he said this, signifying by what death he was going to die.

34. The multitude answered him, We have heard from the law that the Christ remains into the age. And how can thou say, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?

35. Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have the light, so that darkness may not overcome you. And he who walks in the darkness knows not where he is going.

36. While ye have the light, believe in the light, so that ye may become sons of light. Jesus spoke these things, and after departing, he was hid from them.

37. But although having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him,

38. so that the word of Isaiah the prophet that he spoke might be fulfilled: Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Lord been revealed?

39. Because of this they could not believe. Because Isaiah said again,

40. He has blinded their eyes, and has hardened their heart, so that they would not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be turned, and I would heal them.

41. Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke about him.

42. Yet, nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess, so that they would not become excommunicated from the synagogue,

43. for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

44. And Jesus cried out and said, He who believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.

45. And he who sees me sees him who sent me.

46. I have come a light into the world, so that every man who believes in me may not remain in the darkness.

47. And if any man hears my sayings, and will not believe, I do not judge him, for I came not so that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.

48. He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings, has that which judges him: the word that I spoke, that will judge him in the last day.

49. Because I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

50. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore what things I speak, just as the Father has said to me, so I speak.

## John 13

1. Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, having seen that his hour has come that he would depart out of this world to his Father, having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.

2. And supper having occurred, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, that he would betray him,

3. Jesus, having seen that the Father has given all the things to him, into his hands, and that he came from God, and goes to God,

4. rises from supper, and set his garments aside, and after taking a towel, he girded himself.

5. Then he pours water into the wash-basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.

6. So he comes to Simon Peter, and that man says to him, Lord, do thou wash my feet?

7. Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou do not know now, but thou will understand after these things.

8. Peter says to him, Thou may, no, not wash my feet into the age. Jesus answered him, If I may not wash thee, thou have no part with me.

9. Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and head.

10. Jesus says to him, He who is bathed has no need to wash the feet either, but is entirely clean. And ye are clean, but not all.

11. For he knew the man betraying him. Because of this he said, Ye are not all clean.

12. When therefore he washed their feet, and took his garments, having sat down again, he said to them, Do ye understand what I have done to you?

13. Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord. And ye say well, for I am.

14. If I then, the Lord and the teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash each other's feet.

15. For I have given you an example, so that just as I have done to you ye also should do.

16. Truly, truly, I say to you, a bondman is not greater than his lord, nor is an apostle greater than he who sent him.

17. If ye have seen these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.

18. I speak not about you all. I have seen whom I chose, but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me lifted up his heel against me.

19. From henceforth I tell you before it happens, so that when it happens, ye may believe that I am.

20. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives any man whomever I may send, receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.

21. Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in the spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray me.

22. Therefore the disciples looked at each other, being uncertain about whom he speaks.

23. And one of his disciples whom Jesus loved was sitting at Jesus' bosom.

24. Simon Peter therefore gestured to this man to inquire whoever he may be about whom he speaks.

25. And that man, having leaned thus toward Jesus' breast, says to him, Lord, who is he?

26. Jesus replies, He is that man to whom I, having dipped the morsel, will give. And when he dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

27. And after the morsel, then Satan entered into that man. Jesus therefore says to him, What thou do, do more quickly.

28. But no man who was sitting knew why he said this to him.

29. For some thought, since Judas had the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.

30. Therefore having received the morsel, straightaway that man went out, and it was night.

31. When he went out, Jesus says, Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.

32. If God is glorify in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him straightaway.

33. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, ye cannot come, I also now say to you.

34. A new commandment I give to you, that ye should love each other, just as I loved you, so that ye also should love each other.

35. By this all men will know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love among each other.

36. Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where do thou go? Jesus answered him, Where I go, thou cannot follow me now, but thou will follow me afterwards.

37. Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.

38. Jesus answered him, Will thou lay down thy life for me? Truly, truly, I say to thee, A cock will, no, not sound, until thou will deny me thrice.

## John 14

1. Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me.

2. In my Father's house are many dwellings, and if not, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

3. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will take you along to myself, so that where I am, ye may be also.

4. And ye know where I go, and ye know the way.

5. Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou go. How can we know the way?

6. Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man comes to the Father, except by me.

7. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also. And from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

8. Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.

9. Jesus says to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and thou do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. And how can thou say, Show us the Father?

10. Do thou not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The sayings that I speak to you I speak not from myself, but the Father who dwells in me, he does the works.

11. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me. But if not, believe me because of the works themselves.

12. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, that man will also do. And he will do greater than these, because I go to the Father.

13. And anything whatever ye may ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

14. If ye will ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

15. If ye love me, keep my commandments.

16. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, so that he may dwell with you into the age,

17. the Spirit of truth, which the world cannot receive, because it does not see nor know it. But ye know it, because it dwells with you, and will be in you.

18. I will not leave you orphaned. I am coming to you.

19. Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more, but ye see me. Because I live, ye will also live.

20. In that day ye will know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.

21. He who has my commandments, and keeps them, that man it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

22. Judas (not Iscariot) says to him, Lord, and what has happened that thou are going to manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?

23. Jesus answered and said to him, If any man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make a dwelling with him.

24. He who does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.

25. I have spoken these things to you while remaining with you.

26. But the helper, the Holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.

27. Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you, not as the world gives, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be cowardly.

28. Ye heard that I said to you, I go, and I come to you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced because I said I go to the Father, because my Father is greater than I.

29. And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, ye might believe.

30. I will no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of the world comes. And he has nothing on me,

31. but that the world may know that I love the Father. And as the Father commanded me, thus I do. Arise, let us go from here.

## John 15

1. I am the TRUE grapevine, and my Father is the farmer.

2. Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he removes it. And every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it, so that it may bear more fruit.

3. Now ye are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.

4. Dwell in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it dwells in the grapevine, so neither ye, if ye do not dwell in me.

5. I am the grapevine, ye are the branches. He who dwells in me, and I in him, this man bears much fruit, because without me ye can do nothing.

6. If any man does not dwell in me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered. And they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and are burned.

7. If ye dwell in me, and my sayings dwell in you, ye will ask whatever ye may want, and it will be done to you.

8. By this my Father is glorified, that ye may bear much fruit, and ye will become my disciples.

9. As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Dwell ye in my love.

10. If ye keep my commandments, ye will dwell in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments, and dwell in his love.

11. These things I have spoken to you that my joy may dwell in you, and your joy may be full.

12. This is my commandment, that ye love each other, just as I have loved you.

13. Greater love has no man than this, that some man lay down his life for his friends.

14. Ye are my friends, if ye do as many things as I command you.

15. I no longer call you bondmen, because the bondman does not know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, because all things that I heard from my Father, I made known to you.

16. Ye did not choose out me, but I chose out you, and appointed you, so that ye should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit may remain, so that anything whatever ye may ask of the Father in my name, he may give you.

17. These things I command you, so that ye may love each other.

18. If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before you.

19. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own, but because ye are not of the world (instead I chose you out of the world), because of this the world hates you.

20. Remember the word that I said to you, A bondman is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.

21. But all these things they will do to you because of my name, because they have not known him who sent me.

22. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.

23. He who hates me hates my Father also.

24. If I had not done among them the works that no other man has done, they would not have had sin, but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.

25. But, that the word that is written in their law may be fulfilled, They hated me without cause.

26. But when the helper comes whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth that proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.

27. And ye also testify, because ye have been with me from the beginning.

## John 16

1. I have spoken these things to you, so that ye may not be caused to stumble.

2. They will make you excommunicated from the synagogues. But the hour comes that every man who kills you will presume to be offering service to God.

3. And they will do these things, because they have not known the Father nor me.

4. But I have told you these things, so that when the hour comes, ye may remember that I told you of them. But I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you.

5. But now I go to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, Where do thou go?

6. But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.

7. Nevertheless I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I depart, for if I do not depart, the helper will not come to you. But whenever I go, I will send him to you.

8. And having come, he will convict the world about sin, and about justice, and about judgment.

9. About sin because they truly did not believe in me,

10. and about justice because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more,

11. and about judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged.

12. I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.

13. However when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but as many things as he may hear, he will speak. And he will report to you the things that are coming.

14. He will glorify me because he will receive from me, and will report to you.

15. All things, as many as the Father has are mine. Because of this I said that he takes from me, and will report to you.

16. A little while, and ye do not look at me. Again a little while, and ye will see me, because I go to the Father.

17. Therefore some of his disciples said among themselves, What is this that he says to us, A little while, and ye do not look at me, and, Again a little while, and ye will see me, and, Because I go to the Father?

18. They said therefore What is this that he says, A little while? We know not what he says.

19. Therefore Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, Do ye inquire among yourselves about this, because I said, A little while, and ye do not look at me, and, Again a little while, and ye will see me?

20. Truly, truly, I say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. Ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will become into joy.

21. When a woman brings forth she has pain because her hour has come. But when she has given birth to the child she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a man was born into the world.

22. And now therefore indeed ye have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no man takes your joy away from you.

23. And in that day ye will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, that as many things as ye may ask the Father in my name, he will give you.

24. Until now ye have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and ye will receive, so that your joy may be made full.

25. These things I have spoken to you in veiled words. The hour comes, when I will no more speak to you in veiled words, but will inform you plainly about the Father.

26. In that day ye will ask in my name, and I do not say to you, that I will pray the Father about you,

27. for the Father himself loves you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.

28. I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

29. His disciples say to him, Lo, now thou speak plainly, and speak not one veiled word.

30. Now we know that thou know all things, and have no need that any man should question thee. By this we believe that thou came forth from God.

31. Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

32. Behold, the hour comes, and now has come, that ye will be scattered, each man to his own things, and ye will leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

33. These things I have spoken to you, so that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye have tribulation. But cheer up, I have overcome the world.

## John 17

1. Jesus spoke these things, and he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify thy Son, that the Son may also glorify thee,

2. just as thou gave him authority over all flesh, so that all things that thou have given him, he will give them eternal life.

3. And this is eternal life, that they should know thee the only TRUE God, and Jesus Christ whom thou sent.

4. I glorified thee on the earth. I finished the work which thou have given me that I should do.

5. And now, Father, glorify thou me with thyself with the glory that I had with thee before the world was.

6. I manifested thy name to the men whom thou gave me out of the world. They were thine, and thou gave them to me, and they have kept thy word.

7. Now they know that all things, as many as thou gave me are from thee.

8. Because the sayings that thou gave to me, I gave to them. And they received them, and knew truly that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou sent me.

9. I pray about them. I do not pray about the world, but about whom thou have given me, because they are for thee.

10. And all my things are thy things, and thy things are my things, and I am glorified in them.

11. And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name that thou have given to me, so that they may be one, just as we.

12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Whom thou gave to me, I kept, and none of them was destroyed, except the son of destruction, so that the scripture might be fulfilled.

13. And now I come to thee. And I speak these things in the world, so that they may have my joy fulfilled in them.

14. I have given them thy word, and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

15. I pray not that thou should take them out of the world, but that thou should keep them from the evil.

16. They are not of the world just as I am not of the world.

17. Sanctify them in thy truth. Thy word is truth.

18. Just as thou sent me into the world, so also I sent them into the world.

19. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, so that they may also themselves be sanctified in truth.

20. And I pray not about these only, but also about those who believe in me through their word,

21. so that they may all be one, just as thou, Father, are in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that thou sent me.

22. And I, the glory that thou have given me, I have given to them, so that they may be one, just as we are one,

23. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be fully perfected in one, and so that the world may know that thou sent me, and loved them, just as thou loved me.

24. Father, whom thou gave to me, I desire that where I am, they also may be with me, so that they may see my glory that thou have given me, because thou loved me before the foundation of the world.

25. And righteous Father, the world does not know thee, but I know thee, and these know that thou sent me.

26. And I made known to them thy name, and I will make it known, so that the love that thou loved me may be in them, and I in them.

## John 18

1. After speaking these things, Jesus went forth with his disciples on the other side of the brook Kidron, where there was a garden into which he entered, he and his disciples.

2. Now Judas, the man betraying him, had also known the place, because Jesus also often gathered there with his disciples.

3. Judas therefore having received the band and subordinates from the chief priests and the Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

4. Jesus therefore knowing all the things that were coming upon him, after going forth, he says to them, Whom seek ye?

5. They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus says to them, I am he. And Judas, the man betraying him had also stood with them.

6. When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground.

7. Again therefore he questioned them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.

8. Jesus answered, I told you that I am. If therefore ye seek me, allow these men to go,

9. so that the word that he spoke might be fulfilled, Of whom thou have given me, I lost, no, not one of them.

10. Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's bondman, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.

11. Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, shall I, no, not drink it?

12. So the band, and the chief captain, and the subordinates of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound him,

13. and led him away first to Annas. For he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.

14. Now Caiaphas was the man who counseled the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.

15. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, also the other disciple. But that disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.

16. But Peter had stood near the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought in Peter.

17. Therefore the servant girl (the doorkeeper) says to Peter, Are thou not also of this man's disciples? That man says, I am not.

18. Now the bondmen and the subordinates had stood, having made a fire of coals because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also standing with them warming himself.

19. The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his doctrine.

20. Jesus answered him, I spoke in public to the world. I always taught in a synagogue, and in the temple where the Jews always gather together, and I spoke nothing in secret.

21. Why question thou me? Question those who have heard what I said to them. Behold, these know the things that I said.

22. And when he said these things, one of the subordinates standing by gave a slap to Jesus, saying, Answer thou the high priest this way?

23. Jesus answered him, If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if correctly, why strike me?

24. Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

25. Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Therefore they said to him, Are thou not also of his disciples? That man therefore denied, and said, I am not.

26. One of the bondmen of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did I not see thee in the garden with him?

27. Peter therefore denied again, and straightaway a cock sounded.

28. They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. And it was early, and they did not enter into the Praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.

29. Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?

30. They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered him up to thee.

31. Pilate therefore said to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not permitted for us to kill any man,

32. so that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he spoke, signifying what kind of death he was going to die.

33. Pilate therefore again entered into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are thou the king of the Jews?

34. Jesus answered, Do thou say this of thyself, or did others tell thee about me?

35. Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee to me. What have thou done?

36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my subordinates would have fought so that I would not be delivered to the Jews, but now my kingdom is not from here.

37. Pilate therefore said to him, Then thou a king? Jesus answered, Thou say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Every man who is of the truth hears m

38. Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find not one cause in him.

39. But there is a custom for you that I should release to you one man at the Passover. Do ye wish therefore I would release to you the king of the Jews?

40. They all cried out again therefore, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. But Barabbas was a robber.

## John 19

1. Therefore Pilate then took Jesus and scourged him.

2. And the soldiers having woven a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and put around him a purple garment.

3. And they said, Hail, king of the Jews! And they gave him slaps.

4. Therefore Pilate again went forth outside, and says to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, so that ye may know that I find not one cause in him.

5. Jesus therefore came outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe. And he says to them, Look at the man!

6. When therefore the chief priests and the subordinates saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Ye take ye him and crucify, for I find no cause in him.

7. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.

8. When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was more afraid.

9. And he went into the Praetorium again, and says to Jesus, Where are thou from? But Jesus gave him no answer.

10. Pilate therefore says to him, Thou do not speak to me? Know thou not that I have authority to crucify thee, and I have authority to release thee?

11. Jesus answered him, Thou would have no authority against me, unless it were given thee from above. Because of this he who delivered me to thee has greater sin.

12. From this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou are not Caesar's friend. Every man who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.

13. When Pilate therefore heard this word, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

14. Now it was the Preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Look at your king!

15. But they cried out, Away, away, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar.

16. Therefore he then delivered him to them, so that he might be crucified, and they took and led Jesus away.

17. And he went out bearing his cross to a place called, of a Skull, a place that is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,

18. where they crucified him, and two others with him, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle.

19. And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. Therefore many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Latin.

21. Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but, That man said I am king of the Jews.

22. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

23. The soldiers therefore when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. But the tunic was a seamless weave, from the top throughout.

24. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not divide it, but cast lots for it, whose it will be, so that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. There

25. And his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene had stood near the cross of Jesus.

26. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.

27. Then says he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own place.

28. After this, Jesus, having seen that all things are now completed, so that the scripture might be fully complete, says, I thirst.

29. Therefore a vessel full of vinegar was set there. And having filled a sponge with the vinegar, and having put it around a hyssop, they brought it to his mouth.

30. When therefore Jesus received the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and after bowing his head, he gave up the spirit.

31. The Jews therefore, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, since it was Preparation (for it was the high day of that Sabbath), they besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they might be remove

32. The soldiers therefore came, and indeed broke the legs of the first, and of the other man who was crucified with him.

33. But having come to Jesus, when they saw him now having died, they did not break his legs.

34. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and straightaway blood and water came out.

35. And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. And that man knows that he speaks true, so that ye may believe.

36. For these things happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him will be broken.

37. And again another scripture says, They will look toward whom they pierced.

38. And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because of fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might remove the body of Jesus, and Pilate allowed him. Therefore he came and removed the bod

39. And Nicodemus also came (he who at the first came to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.

40. So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, just as is the custom of the Jews to bury.

41. Now a garden was in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new sepulcher in which no man was yet laid.

42. Therefore because of the Jews' Preparation (because the sepulcher was near) they laid Jesus there.

## John 20

1. Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene comes early, while it was still darkness, to the sepulcher, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher.

2. Therefore she runs and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.

3. Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the sepulcher.

4. And the two men ran together, and the other disciple ran ahead quicker than Peter and came first to the sepulcher.

5. And after stooping down, he sees the linen cloths lying, yet he entered not.

6. Simon Peter therefore comes following him, and he entered into the sepulcher. And he sees the linen cloths lying,

7. and the face cloth that was on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped up in one place separately.

8. Therefore then the other disciple who came first to the sepulcher, also entered in, and he saw and believed.

9. For they had not yet known the scripture that he must rise from the dead.

10. So the disciples departed again to themselves.

11. But Mary had stood outside near the sepulcher weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped down to the sepulcher.

12. And she sees two heavenly agents in white, sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was lain.

13. And those men say to her, Woman, why weep thou? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.

14. And having said these things, she turned backward, and sees Jesus standing. And she had not known that it is Jesus.

15. Jesus says to her, Woman, why weep thou? Whom seek thou? That woman, supposing that he is the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou have taken him, tell me where thou have laid him, and I will take him away.

16. Jesus says to her, Mary. After turning around, that woman says to him, Rabboni, which says, Teacher.

17. Jesus says to her, Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.

18. Mary Magdalene comes informing the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and he spoke these things to her.

19. Therefore being evening that day, the first day of the week, and the doors having been shut where the disciples were who assembled because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace to you.

20. And having said this, he showed them his hands and side. His disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.

21. Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.

22. And after saying this, he breathed on them, and says to them, Receive ye Holy Spirit.

23. If ye forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If ye retain of any, they are retained.

24. But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

25. The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I may see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will, no, no

26. And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.

27. Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here, and see my hands, and bring thy hand, and put into my side, and do not become faithless, but believing.

28. Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.

29. Jesus says to him, Because thou have seen me, thou have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.

30. And indeed therefore many other signs Jesus did in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.

31. But these are written, so that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name.

## John 21

1. After these things Jesus manifested himself again to his disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he revealed himself this way.

2. There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other men of his disciples.

3. Simon Peter says to them, I am going to harvest fish. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and straightaway entered into the boat. And in that night they caught nothing.

4. But having now become morning, Jesus stood on the shore. However the disciples had not seen that it was Jesus.

5. Therefore Jesus says to them, Children, have ye anything eatable? They answered him, No.

6. And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye will find. Therefore they cast, and they were no longer able to draw it for the magnitude of fishes.

7. That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it is the Lord, he tied the coat around himself (for he was undressed), and threw himself into the sea.

8. And the other disciples came in the skiff (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net of the fishes.

9. So when they came to the land, they saw a fire of coals set, and fish laying on it, and bread.

10. Jesus says to them, Bring from the fishes that ye now caught.

11. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And being so many, the net was not broken.

12. Jesus says to them, Come, eat breakfast. And none of the disciples dared to query him, Who are thou? knowing that it is the Lord.

13. Jesus therefore comes, and takes the bread, and gives to them, and the fish likewise.

14. This is now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples after being raised from the dead.

15. So when they ate breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me more than these things? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.

16. He says to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my sheep.

17. He says to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do thou love me? And he said to him, Lord, thou know all things. Thou know that I love thee. Jesus says t

18. Truly, truly, I say to thee, When thou were younger, thou girded thyself, and walked where thou would, but when thou become old, thou will stretch forth thy hands, and another will gird thee, and carry thee where thou do not want.

19. Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he will glorify God. And after saying this, he says to him, Follow me.

20. But Peter, having turned around, sees the disciple whom Jesus loves, following, who also leaned near his chest at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the man betraying thee?

21. Having seen this man, Peter says to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man?

22. Jesus says to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.

23. This saying therefore went forth among the brothers, that that disciple does not die. And yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee?

24. This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and who wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.

25. And there are also many other things, as many as Jesus did, which if they would be written every one, I suppose not even the world itself to make room for the books being written. Truly.
