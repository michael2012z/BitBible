20. But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou are defiled, and some man has lain with thee besides thy husband,

21. then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when LORD makes thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell.

4. All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk.

5. All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head. Until the days be fulfilled, in which he separates himself to LORD, he shall be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.

6. He shall not come near to a dead body all the days that he separates himself to LORD.

7. He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is upon his head.

8. All the days of his separation he is holy to LORD.

9. And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.

10. And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.

11. And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.

12. And he shall separate to LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering. But the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.

13. And this is the law of the Nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled: He shall be brought to the door of the tent of meeting,

14. and he shall offer his oblation to LORD: one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,

15. and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.

16. And the priest shall present them before LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering.

17. And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall also offer the meal-offering of it, and the drink-offering of it.

18. And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.

19. And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after he has shaven his separation,

20. and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before LORD. This is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh. And after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

21. This is the law of the Nazarite who vows, [and of] his oblation to LORD for his separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.

22. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This way ye shall bless the sons of Israel: Ye shall say to them,

24. LORD bless thee, and keep thee.

25. LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee.

26. LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

27. So shall they put my name upon the sons of Israel, and I will bless them.

## Numbers 8

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron, and say to him, When thou light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.

3. And Aaron did so. He lit the lamps of it in front of the candlestick, as LORD commanded Moses.

4. And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold. To the base of it, [and] to the flowers of it, it was beaten work. According to the pattern which LORD had shown Moses, so he made the candlestick.

5. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and cleanse them.

7. And thus thou shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.

8. Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering--fine flour mingled with oil. And thou shall take another young bullock for a sin-offering.

9. And thou shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting. And thou shall assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel,

10. and thou shall present the Levites before LORD. And the sons of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites.

11. And Aaron shall offer the Levites before LORD for a wave-offering on the behalf of the sons of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of LORD.

12. And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks, and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, to LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.

13. And thou shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering to LORD.

14. Thus shall thou separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.

15. And after that the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tent of meeting. And thou shall cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.

16. For they are wholly given to me from among the sons of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the first-born of all the sons of Israel, I have taken them to me.

17. For all the first-born among the sons of Israel are mine, both man and beast. On the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

18. And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the sons of Israel.

19. And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the sons of Israel, that there be no plague am

20. Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the Levites. According to all that LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.

22. And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons. As LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.

23. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

24. This is that which belongs to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting.

25. And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,

26. but shall minister with their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shall thou do to the Levites concerning their charges.

## Numbers 9

1. And LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they came out of the land of Egypt, saying,

2. Moreover let the sons of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season.

3. In the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, ye shall keep it in its appointed season. According to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances of it, ye shall keep it.

4. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, that they should keep the Passover.

5. And they kept the Passover in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that LORD commanded Moses, so did the sons of Israel.

6. And there were certain men who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day. And they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day,

7. and those men said to him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of LORD in its appointed season among the sons of Israel?

8. And Moses said to them, Stay ye, that I may hear what LORD will command concerning you.

9. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the Passover to LORD.

11. In the second month on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

12. They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it.

13. But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbears to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he did not offer the oblation of LORD in its appointed season; that man shall bear his sin.

14. And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the Passover to LORD, according to the statute of the Passover, and according to the ordinance of it, so shall he do. Ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and f

15. And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony, and at evening it was upon the tabernacle, as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.

16. So it was always: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.

17. And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, then after that the sons of Israel journeyed. And in the place where the cloud abode, there the sons of Israel encamped.

18. At the commandment of LORD the sons of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of LORD they encamped. As long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.

19. And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the sons of Israel kept the charge of LORD, and did not journey.

20. And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle, then according to the commandment of LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of LORD they journeyed.

21. And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning, and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed, or [if] by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

22. Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding on it, the sons of Israel remained encamped, and did not journey, but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

23. At the commandment of LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of LORD they journeyed. They kept the charge of LORD, at the commandment of LORD by Moses.

## Numbers 10

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Make thee two trumpets of silver, of beaten work thou shall make them. And thou shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.

3. And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to thee at the door of the tent of meeting.

4. And if they blow but one, then the rulers, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to thee.

5. And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.

6. And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.

7. But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets, and they shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.

9. And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresses you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. And ye shall be remembered before LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

10. Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings. And they shall be to you for a m

11. And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.

12. And the sons of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.

13. And they first took their journey according to the commandment of LORD by Moses.

14. And in the first [place] the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

15. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.

18. And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

19. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

20. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

21. And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary, and [the others] set up the tabernacle until their coming.

22. And the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.

23. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

24. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

25. And the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their armies, and over his army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

26. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.

27. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.

28. Thus were the journeys of the sons of Israel according to their armies, and they set forward.

29. And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which LORD said, I will give it to you. Come thou with us, and we will do thee good, for LORD has spoken good concerni

30. And he said to him, I will not go, but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.

31. And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee, inasmuch as thou know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shall be to us instead of eyes.

32. And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that whatever good LORD shall do to us, the same we will do to thee.

33. And they set forward from the mount of LORD three days' journey. And the ark of the covenant of LORD went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.

34. And the cloud of LORD was over them by day when they set forward from the camp.

35. And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let those who hate thee flee before thee.

36. And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.

## Numbers 11

1. And the people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of LORD. And when LORD heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of LORD burnt among them, and devoured in the outermost part of the camp.

2. And the people cried to Moses. And Moses prayed to LORD, and the fire abated.

3. And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of LORD burnt among them.

4. And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly. And the sons of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?

5. We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic,

6. but now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all except this manna to look upon.

7. And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance of it as the appearance of bdellium.

8. The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

9. And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.

10. And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent. And the anger of LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased.

11. And Moses said to LORD, Why have thou dealt ill with thy servant? And why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou lay the burden of all this people upon me?

12. Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth, that thou should say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carries the sucking child, to the land which thou swore to their fathers?

13. From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

14. I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.

15. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight, and let me not see my wretchedness.

16. And LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them. And bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.

17. And I will come down and talk with thee there. And I will take from the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou not bear it thyself alone.

18. And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh, for ye have wept in the ears of LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore LORD will give you

19. Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,

20. but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you, because ye have rejected LORD who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why did we come forth out of Egypt?

21. And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen, and thou have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

22. Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?

23. And LORD said to Moses, Is LORD's hand grown short? Now thou shall see whether my word shall come to pass to thee or not.

24. And Moses went out, and told the people the words of LORD. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tent.

25. And LORD came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took from the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders. And it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no mor

26. But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. And they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the tent. And they prophesied

27. And a young man ran, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.

28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

29. And Moses said to him, Are thou jealous for my sake? Would that all of LORD's people were prophets, that LORD would put his Spirit upon them!

30. And Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

31. And there went forth a wind from LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the

32. And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.

33. While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of LORD was kindled against the people, and LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

34. And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.

35. From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they abode at Hazeroth.

## Numbers 12

1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.

2. And they said, Has LORD indeed spoken only with Moses? Has he not spoken also with us? And LORD heard it.

3. Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.

4. And LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tent of meeting. And the three came out.

5. And LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both came forth.

6. And he said, Hear now my words. If there be a prophet among you, I LORD will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.

7. My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.

8. With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches, and he shall behold the form of LORD. Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?

9. And the anger of LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.

10. And the cloud removed from over the tent. And, behold, Miriam was leprous, as snow. And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

11. And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.

12. Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.

13. And Moses cried to LORD, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.

14. And LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.

15. And Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days. And the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

16. And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.

## Numbers 13

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel. From every tribe of their fathers ye shall send a man, each one a ruler among them.

3. And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of LORD. All of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.

4. And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;

5. of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;

6. of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;

7. of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;

8. of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;

9. of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;

10. of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;

11. of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;

12. of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;

13. of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;

14. of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;

15. of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

16. These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.

17. And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country.

18. And see the land, what it is, and the people who dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,

19. and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad, and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds,

20. and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.

21. So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.

22. And they went up by the South, and came to Hebron. And Ahaiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

23. And they came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a staff between two, also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

24. That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there.

25. And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.

26. And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and shown them the fruit of the la

27. And they told him, and said, We came to the land where thou sent us. And surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it.

28. However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, very great, and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

29. Amalek dwells in the land of the South. And the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country. And the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.

30. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it.

31. But the men who went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.

32. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the sons of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up the inhabitants of it. And all the people that we saw

33. And we saw there the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim. And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

## Numbers 14

1. And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried, and the people wept that night.

2. And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. And the whole congregation said to them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt, or would that we had died in this wilderness!

3. And why does LORD bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey. Were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

4. And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.

6. And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.

7. And they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.

8. If LORD delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey.

9. Only do not rebel against LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and LORD is with us. Fear them not.

10. But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of LORD appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.

11. And LORD said to Moses, How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?

12. I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.

13. And Moses said to LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear it, for thou brought up this people in thy might from among them,

14. and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou LORD are in the midst of this people, for thou LORD are seen face to face, and thy cloud stands over them, and thou go before them, in a pillar of clo

15. Now if thou shall kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

16. Because LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.

17. And now, I pray thee, let the power of LORD be great, according as thou have spoken, saying,

18. LORD is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the third and upon the fourth gene

19. Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy loving kindness, and according as thou have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

20. And LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word,

21. but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of LORD,

22. because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice,

23. surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them who despised me see it.

24. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went, and his seed shall possess it.

25. Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley. Tomorrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.

26. And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

27. How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against me.

28. Say to them, As I live, says LORD, surely as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you.

29. Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. And all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,

30. surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell in it, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

31. But your little ones, that ye said would be a prey, them I will bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.

32. But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.

33. And your sons shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.

34. After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, ye shall bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.

35. I, LORD, have spoken, surely I will do this to all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

36. And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land,

37. even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before LORD.

38. But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.

39. And Moses told these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.

40. And they rose up early in the morning, and got up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which LORD has promised, for we have sinned.

41. And Moses said, Why do ye now transgress the commandment of LORD, seeing it shall not prosper?

42. Do not go up, for LORD is not among you, that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.

43. For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword. Because ye have turned back from following LORD, therefore LORD will not be with you.

44. But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain, nevertheless the ark of the covenant of LORD, and Moses, did not depart out of the camp.

45. Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even to Hormah.

## Numbers 15

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,

3. and will make an offering by fire to LORD, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor to LORD, of the herd, or of the flock,

4. then he who offers his oblation shall offer to LORD a meal-offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil.

5. And wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, thou shall prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.

6. Or for a ram, thou shall prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil.

7. And for the drink-offering thou shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor to LORD.

8. And when thou prepare a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings to LORD;

9. then he shall offer with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil.

10. And thou shall offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to LORD.

11. Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.

12. According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.

13. All who are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to LORD.

14. And if a stranger sojourns with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

15. For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger who sojourns [with you], a statute forever throughout your generations. As ye are, so shall the sojourner be before LORD.

16. One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger who sojourns with you.

17. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land where I bring you,

19. then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering to LORD.

20. Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering, as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.

21. Of the first of your dough ye shall give to LORD a heave-offering throughout your generations.

22. And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which LORD has spoken to Moses,

23. even all that LORD has commanded you by Moses, from the day that LORD gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations,

24. then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor to LORD, with the meal-offering of it, and the

25. And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they shall be forgiven, for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire to LORD, and their sin-offering bef

26. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them, for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.

27. And if one soul sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.

28. And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that errs, when he sins unwittingly, before LORD, to make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.

29. Ye shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is home-born among the sons of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them.

30. But the soul that does anything with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemes LORD, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

31. Because he has despised the word of LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.

32. And while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the Sabbath day.

33. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.

34. And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.

35. And LORD said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.

36. And all the congregation brought him outside the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as LORD commanded Moses.

37. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

38. Speak to the sons of Israel, and bid them that they make for them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue.

39. And it shall be to you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of LORD, and do them, and that ye not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot,

40. that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.

41. I am LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am LORD your God.

## Numbers 16

1. Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took,

2. and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty rulers of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown,

3. and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, Ye take too much upon you, since all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and LORD is among them. Why then do ye lift up yourselves

4. And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face.

5. And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the morning LORD will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him, even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near to him.

6. This do: Take you censers, Korah, and all his company,

7. and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before LORD tomorrow. And it shall be that the man whom LORD chooses, he [is] holy. Ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

8. And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi.

9. [Is it] a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to

10. and that he has brought thee near, and all thy brothers the sons of Levi with thee? And ye seek the priesthood also?

11. Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against LORD. And Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?

12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. And they said, We will not come up.

13. Is it a small thing that thou have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must make thyself also a ruler over us?

14. Moreover thou have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will thou put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.

15. And Moses was very angry, and said to LORD, Do not respect thou their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.

16. And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy company before LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.

17. And take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.

18. And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.

19. And Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the tent of meeting. And the glory of LORD appeared to all the congregation.

20. And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.

22. And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will thou be angry with all the congregation?

23. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

25. And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.

26. And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

27. So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.

28. And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that LORD has sent me to do all these works, for [it is] not of my own mind.

29. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then LORD has not sent me.

30. But if LORD makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that pertains to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then ye shall understand that these men have despised LORD.

31. And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split asunder that was under them,

32. and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that pertained to Korah, and all their goods.

33. So they, and all that pertained to them, went down alive into Sheol. And the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.

34. And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them, for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.

35. And fire came forth from LORD, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men who offered the incense.

36. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

37. Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder, for they are holy,

38. even the censers of these sinners against their own lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before LORD, therefore they are holy, and they shall be a sign to the sons of Israel.

39. And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which those who were burnt had offered, and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,

40. to be a memorial to the sons of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before LORD, that he not be as Korah, and as his company, as LORD spoke to him by Moses.

41. But on the morrow all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of LORD.

42. And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting, and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of LORD appeared.

43. And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.

44. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

45. Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

46. And Moses said to Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from LORD. The plague has be

47. And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly. And, behold, the plague had begun among the people. And he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.

48. And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.

49. Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.

50. And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.

## Numbers 17

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and take rods from them, one for each fathers' house, from all their rulers according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods. Write thou every man's name upon his rod.

3. And thou shall write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.

4. And thou shall lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.

5. And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud. And I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against you.

6. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel. And all their rulers gave him rods, for each ruler one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.

7. And Moses laid up the rods before LORD in the tent of the testimony.

8. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.

9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before LORD to all the sons of Israel. And they looked, and took every man his rod.

10. And LORD said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a sign against the sons of rebellion, that thou may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die.

11. Thus Moses did. As LORD commanded him, so he did.

12. And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.

13. Every man who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of LORD, dies. Shall we all of us perish?

## Numbers 18

1. And LORD said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary, and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

2. And thy brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee, but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.

3. And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tent. Only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor ye.

4. And they shall be joined to thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent, and a stranger shall not come near to you.

5. And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, that there be no more wrath upon the sons of Israel.

6. And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the sons of Israel. They are a gift to you, given to LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting.

7. And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil, and ye shall serve. I give you the priesthood as a service of gift. And the stranger who comes near shall be put

8. And LORD spoke to Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel. I have given them to thee by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for

9. This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render t

10. As the most holy things thou shall eat of it; every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to thee.

11. And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel. I have given them to thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in thy h

12. All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give to LORD, I have given them to thee.

13. The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to LORD, shall be thine. Everyone who is clean in thy house shall eat of it.

14. Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.

15. Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to LORD, both of man and beast shall be thine. Nevertheless the first-born of man thou shall surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts thou shall redeem.

16. And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).

17. But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shall not redeem. They are holy. Thou shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a

18. And the flesh of them shall be thine. As the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.

19. All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the sons of Israel offer to LORD, I have given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion forever. It is a covenant of salt forever before LORD to thee and to thy

20. And LORD said to Aaron, Thou shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall thou have any portion among them. I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the sons of Israel.

21. And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.

22. And henceforth the sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.

23. But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. And among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

24. For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, Among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

25. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

26. Moreover thou shall speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for LORD, a tithe of the

27. And your heave-offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the winepress.

28. Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering to LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the sons of Israel. And from it ye shall give LORD's heave-offering to Aaron the priest.

29. Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of LORD, of all the best of it, even the hallowed part of it out of it.

30. Therefore thou shall say to them, When ye heave the best of it from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.

31. And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.

32. And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it. And ye shall not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, that ye not die.

## Numbers 19

1. And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. This is the statute of the law which LORD has commanded, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, [and] upon which a yoke never came.

3. And ye shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth outside the camp, and she shall be killed before his face.

4. And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.

5. And the heifer shall be burned in his sight: her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, he shall burn.

6. And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

7. Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water. And afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.

8. And he who burned her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.

9. And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place. And it shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a water for impurity. It is a sin-offering.

10. And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger who sojourns among them, for a statute forever.

11. He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.

12. The same shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean, but if he does not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

13. Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of LORD. And that soul shall be cut off from Israel, because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him. He s

14. This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

15. And every open vessel, which has no covering bound upon it, is unclean.

16. And whoever in the open field touches a man who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

17. And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering, and running water shall be put with that in a vessel.

18. And a clean man shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the souls who were there, and upon him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave.

19. And the clean man shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day. And on the seventh day he shall purify him. And he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.

20. But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of LORD. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled upon him; he is

21. And it shall be a perpetual statute to them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.

22. And whatever the unclean man touches shall be unclean, and the soul who touches it shall be unclean until evening.

## Numbers 20

1. And the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people abode in Kadesh. And Miriam died there, and was buried there.

2. And there was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

3. And the people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we had died when our brothers died before LORD!

4. And why have ye brought the assembly of LORD into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?

5. And why have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink.

6. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces. And the glory of LORD appeared to them.

7. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

8. Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water, and thou shall bring forth water to them out of the rock. So thou shall give the co

9. And Moses took the rod from before LORD, as he commanded him.

10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels. Shall we bring forth water to you out of this rock?

11. And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice, and water came forth abundantly. And the congregation drank, and their cattle.

12. And LORD said to Moses and Aaron, Because ye did not believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.

13. These are the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel strove with LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says thy brother Israel, Thou know all the travail that has befallen us,

15. how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us and our fathers.

16. And when we cried to LORD, he heard our voice, and sent a [heavenly] agent, and brought us forth out of Egypt. And, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the outermost of thy border.

17. Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells. We will go along the king's highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand nor to t

18. And Edom said to him, Thou shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.

19. And the sons of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway. And if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price of it. Only let me, without [doing] anything, pass through on my feet.

20. And he said, Thou shall not pass through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.

21. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border. Therefore Israel turned away from him.

22. And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to mount Hor.

23. And LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,

24. Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.

25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor,

26. and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son. And Aaron shall be gathered, and shall die there.

27. And Moses did as LORD commanded. And they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there on the top of the mount, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

29. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

## Numbers 21

1. And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim, and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.

2. And Israel vowed a vow to LORD, and said, If thou will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.

3. And LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites. And they utterly destroyed them and their cities. And the name of the place was called Hormah.

4. And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to encompass the land of Edom. And the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.

5. And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water, and our soul loathes this light bread.

6. And LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and many people of Israel died.

7. And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against LORD, and against thee. Pray to LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.

8. And LORD said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard. And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.

9. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard. And it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.

10. And the sons of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.

11. And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.

12. From there they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.

13. From there they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

14. Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of LORD, Vaheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,

15. and the slope of the valleys that inclines toward the dwelling of Ar, and leans upon the border of Moab.

16. And from there [they journeyed] to Beer. That is the well of which LORD said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

17. Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well. Sing ye to it,

18. the well, which the rulers dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, [and] with their staves. And from the wilderness [they journeyed] to Mattanah,

19. and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,

20. and from Bamoth to the valley which is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down upon the desert.

21. And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

22. Let me pass through thy land. We will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king's highway, until we have passed thy border.

23. And Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel.

24. And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon, for the border of the sons of Ammon was strong.

25. And Israel took all these cities. And Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns of it.

26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.

27. Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established.

28. For a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of the Arnon.

29. Woe to thee, Moab! Thou are undone, O people of Chemosh. He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.

30. We have shot at them. Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid waste even to Nophah, which [reaches] to Medeba.

31. Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

32. And Moses sent to spy out Jazer. And they took the towns of it, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

33. And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

34. And LORD said to Moses, Fear him not, for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land. And thou shall do to him as thou did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

35. So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left to him remaining. And they possessed his land.

## Numbers 22

1. And the sons of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.

2. And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

3. And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people, because they were many. And Moab was distressed because of the sons of Israel.

4. And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.

5. And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the face of the earth, and the

6. Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom thou bless is blessed, a

7. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand, and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.

8. And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as LORD shall speak to me. And the rulers of Moab abode with Balaam.

9. And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?

10. And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, [saying],

11. Behold, the people came out of Egypt, it covers the face of the earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.

12. And God said to Balaam, Thou shall not go with them. Thou shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.

13. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the rulers of Balak, Get into your land, for LORD refuses to give me leave to go with you.

14. And the rulers of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.

15. And Balak sent yet again rulers, more, and more honorable than they.

16. And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming to me.

17. For I will promote thee to very great honor, and whatever thou say to me I will do. Come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me.

18. And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of LORD my God, to do less or more.

19. Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what LORD will speak to me more.

20. And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, go with them, but only the word which I speak to thee, that shall thou do.

21. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the rulers of Moab.

22. And God's anger was kindled because he went, and the agent of LORD placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his donkey, and his two servants were with him.

23. And the donkey saw the agent of LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field. And Balaam smote the donkey, to turn her into the way.

24. Then the agent of LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

25. And the donkey saw the agent of LORD, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall. And he smote her again.

26. And the agent of LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

27. And the donkey saw the agent of LORD, and she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the donkey with his staff.

28. And LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou have smitten me these three times?

29. And Balaam said to the donkey, Because thou have mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed thee.

30. And the donkey said to Balaam, Am not I thy donkey, upon which thou have ridden all thy life long to this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so to thee? And he said, No.

31. Then LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the agent of LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand. And he bowed his head, and fell on his face.

32. And the agent of LORD said to him, Why have thou smitten thy donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me.

33. And the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have even slain thee, and saved her alive.

34. And Balaam said to the agent of LORD, I have sinned, for I knew not that thou stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get back again.

35. And the agent of LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men, but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shall speak. So Balaam went with the rulers of Balak.

36. And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the outmost part of the border.

37. And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? Why did thou not come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?

38. And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to thee. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.

39. And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.

40. And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the rulers that were with him.

41. And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and he saw from there the outmost part of the people.

## Numbers 23

1. And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken. And Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

3. And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go. Perhaps LORD will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.

4. And God met Balaam, and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.

5. And LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus thou shall speak.

6. And he returned to him. And, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the rulers of Moab.

7. And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram Balak has brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.

8. How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom LORD has not defied?

9. For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Lo, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.

10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

11. And Balak said to Balaam, What have thou done to me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou have blessed them altogether.

12. And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which LORD puts in my mouth?

13. And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from where thou may see them. Thou shall see but the outmost part of them, and shall not see them all, and curse them for me from there.

14. And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.

15. And he said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet [LORD] yonder.

16. And LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shall thou speak.

17. And he came to him. And, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the rulers of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has LORD spoken?

18. And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear. Hearken to me, thou son of Zippor.

19. God is not a man, that he should lie, neither the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?

20. Behold, I have received to bless. And he has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.

21. He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.

22. God brings them forth out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox.

23. Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God wrought!

24. Behold, the people rise up as a lioness, and as a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain.

25. And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.

26. But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that LORD speaks, that I must do?

27. And Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take thee to another place. Perhaps it will please God that thou may curse them for me from there.

28. And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down upon the desert.

29. And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

30. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.

## Numbers 24

1. And when Balaam saw that it pleased LORD to bless Israel, he did not go, as at the other times, to meet with omens, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

2. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him.

3. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, and the man whose eye was closed says,

4. he says who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open,

5. How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy tabernacles, O Israel!

6. As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the river-side, as aloes which LORD has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.

7. Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.

8. God brings him forth out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces, and smite [them] through with his arrows.

9. He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness. Who shall rouse him up? He who blesses thee is blessed, And he who curses thee is cursed.

10. And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou have altogether blessed them these three times.

11. Therefore now flee thou to thy place. I thought to promote thee to great honor, but, lo, LORD has kept thee back from honor.

12. And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to thy messengers that thou sent to me, saying,

13. If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind. What LORD speaks, that I will speak?

14. And now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will advise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

15. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, and the man whose eye was closed says,

16. he says who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:

17. I see him, but not now. I behold him, but not near. There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of tumult.

18. And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, [who were] his enemies, while Israel does valiantly.

19. And out of Jacob shall come he who shall have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city.

20. And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall come to destruction.

21. And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest is set in the rock.

22. Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

23. And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this?

24. But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall come to destruction.

25. And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went his way.

## Numbers 25

1. And Israel abode in Shittim. And the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab,

2. for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. And the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.

3. And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor, and the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel.

4. And LORD said to Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to LORD before the sun, that the fierce anger of LORD may turn away from Israel.

5. And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Kill ye every one his men who have joined themselves to Baal-peor.

6. And, behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of mee

7. And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.

8. And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the sons of Israel.

9. And those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.

10. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

11. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the sons of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the sons of Israel in my jealousy.

12. Therefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.

13. And it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the sons of Israel.

14. Now the name of the man of Israel who was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a ruler of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.

15. And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.

16. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

17. Vex the Midianites, and smite them,

18. for they vex you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the ruler of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor

2. And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the rulers and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,

3. Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against LORD in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.

4. Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father.

5. And Moses brought their case before LORD.

7. The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. Thou shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers, and thou shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.

13. And when thou have seen it, thou also shall be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered,

14. because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)

40. And Moses told the sons of Israel according to all that LORD commanded Moses.

## Numbers 30

1. And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which LORD has commanded.

2. When a man vows a vow to LORD, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.

3. Also when a woman vows a vow to LORD, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,

4. and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father remains silent at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.

5. But if her father disallows her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand. And LORD will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.

6. And if she is [married] to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul,

7. and her husband hears it, and remains silent at her in the day that he hears it, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand.

8. But if her husband disallows her in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul. And LORD will forgive her.

9. But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, [even] everything with which she has bound her soul shall stand against her.

10. And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,

11. and her husband heard it, and remained silent at her, and did not disallow her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.

12. But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has made them void, and LORD wi

13. Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

14. But if her husband altogether remains silent at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her. He has established them, because he remained silent at her in the day that he heard them.

15. But if he shall make them null and void after he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.

16. These are the statutes, which LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth in her father's house.

## Numbers 31

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Avenge the sons of Israel of the Midianites. Afterward thou shall be gathered to thy people.

3. And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute LORD's vengeance on Midian.

4. From every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, ye shall send to the war.

5. So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

6. And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.

7. And they warred against Midian as LORD commanded Moses, and they killed every male.

8. And they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.

9. And the sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones. And all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.

10. And all their cities in the places in which they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.

11. And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.

12. And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.

13. And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the rulers of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside the camp.

14. And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.

15. And Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

16. Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against LORD in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of LORD.

17. Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.

18. But all the women-children, who have not known man by laying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

19. And encamp ye outside the camp seven days. Whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.

20. And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' [hair], and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.

21. And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which LORD has commanded Moses:

22. only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead--

23. everything which may go into fire--ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity. And all that may not go into fire ye shall make to go through the water.

24. And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

25. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

26. Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the congregation,

27. and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war who went out to battle, and all the congregation.

28. And levy a tribute to LORD of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the donkeys, and of the flocks.

29. Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for LORD's heave-offering.

30. And of the sons of Israel's half, thou shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, [even] of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabe

31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as LORD commanded Moses.

32. Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,

33. and seventy-two thousand oxen,

34. and sixty-one thousand donkeys,

35. and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by laying with him.

36. And the half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand and five hundred sheep.

37. And LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.

38. And the oxen were thirty-six thousand, of which LORD's tribute was seventy-two.

39. And the donkeys were thirty thousand and five hundred, of which LORD's tribute was sixty-one.

40. And the persons were sixteen thousand, of whom LORD's tribute was thirty-two persons.

41. And Moses gave the tribute, which was LORD's heave-offering, to Eleazar the priest, as LORD commanded Moses.

42. And of the sons of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men who warred

43. (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand and five hundred sheep,

44. and thirty-six thousand oxen,

45. and thirty thousand and five hundred donkeys,

46. and sixteen thousand persons),

47. even of the sons of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of LORD, as LORD commanded Moses.

48. And the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses.

49. And they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.

50. And we have brought LORD's oblation, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, earrings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before LORD.

51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, even all wrought jewels.

52. And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

53. ([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)

54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the sons of Israel before LORD.

## Numbers 32

1. Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle. And when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle,

2. the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the rulers of the congregation, saying,

3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

4. the land which LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.

5. And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession. Bring us not over the Jordan.

6. And Moses said to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall ye sit here?

7. And why do ye discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which LORD has given them?

8. Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.

9. For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel, that they should not go into the land which LORD had given them.

10. And LORD's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,

11. Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me,

12. except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have wholly followed LORD.

13. And LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of LORD was consumed.

14. And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of LORD toward Israel.

15. For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness, and ye will destroy all this people.

16. And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones,

17. but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

18. We will not return to our houses until the sons of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

19. For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.

20. And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before LORD to the war,

21. and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,

22. and the land is subdued before LORD, then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards LORD, and towards Israel, and this land shall be to you for a possession before LORD.

23. But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out.

24. Build for you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep, and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.

25. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commands.

26. Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead,

27. but thy servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before LORD to battle, as my lord says.

28. So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.

29. And Moses said to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gil

30. but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

31. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As LORD has said to thy servants, so we will do.

32. We will pass over armed before LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance [is] with us beyond the Jordan.

33. And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according t

34. And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

35. and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,

36. and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.

37. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

38. and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah. And they gave other names to the cities which they built.

39. And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were in it.

40. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it.

41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns of it, and called them Havvoth-jair.

42. And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages of it, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

## Numbers 33

38. And Aaron the priest went up onto mount Hor at the commandment of LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.

39. And Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died in mount Hor.

51. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

52. then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured [stones], and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places.

53. And ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell in it, for to you I have given the land to possess it.

54. And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families. To the more ye shall give more inheritance, and to the few thou shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. Ye shall inherit ac

55. But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those that ye let remain of them shall be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land in which ye dwell.

56. And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do to them, so I will do to you.

## Numbers 34

1. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders of it),

3. then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom. And your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward.

4. And your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin. And the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea. And it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon.

5. And the border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

6. And for the western border, ye shall have the great sea and the border [of it]. This shall be your west border.

7. And this shall be your north border: From the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor.

8. From mount Hor ye shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath. And the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad.

9. And the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border.

10. And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.

11. And the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain. And the border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward.

12. And the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to the borders of it round about.

13. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which LORD has commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe.

14. For the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance.

15. The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.

16. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

17. These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

18. And ye shall take one ruler of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.

19. And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

## Numbers 35

1. And LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in. And ye shall give suburbs for the cities round about them to the Levites.

3. And they shall have the cities to dwell in, and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.

4. And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.

5. And ye shall measure outside the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the m

6. And of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, there shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee to. And besides them ye shall give forty-two cities.

7. All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, them with their suburbs.

8. And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the sons of Israel, from the many ye shall take many, and from the few ye shall take few. Everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his

9. And LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

11. then ye shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.

12. And the cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.

13. And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.

14. Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities ye shall give in the land of Canaan. They shall be cities of refuge.

15. For the sons of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, these six cities shall be for refuge, that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.

16. But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.

17. And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.

18. Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.

19. The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death. When he meets him, he shall put him to death.

20. And if he thrust him from hatred, or hurled at him, laying in wait, so that he died,

21. or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died, he who smote him shall surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.

22. But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without laying in wait,

23. or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, nor sought his harm,

24. then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.

25. And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge where he fled. And he shall dwell in it until the death of the high priest, who

26. But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge where he flees,

27. and the avenger of blood find him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,

28. because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.

29. And these things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

30. Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses, but one witness shall not testify against any person so that he dies.

31. Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.

32. And ye shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.

33. So ye shall not pollute the land in which ye are, for blood, it pollutes the land. And no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it.

34. And thou shall not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell, for I, LORD, dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel.

## Numbers 36

1. And the heads of the fathers of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the rulers, the heads of the fathers of

2. And they said, LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel. And my lord was commanded by LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.

3. And if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they s

4. And when the jubilee of the sons of Israel shall be, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our

5. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speak right.

6. This is the thing which LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best, only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.

7. So no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall remove from tribe to tribe, for the sons of Israel shall cling each one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

8. And every daughter, who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the sons of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the sons of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.

9. So no inheritance shall move from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cling each one to his own inheritance.

10. Even as LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad,

11. for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophedad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.

12. They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.

13. These are the commandments and the ordinances which LORD commanded by Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
