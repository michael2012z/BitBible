# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave him to show his bondmen what must happen quickly. And he signified it, having sent by his agent to his bondman John

2. who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things as he saw.

3. Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and who keep the things written in it, for the time is near.

4. John, to the seven congregations in Asia: Grace to you and peace from God, who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne,

5. and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and washed us from our sins by his blood

6. and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him is the glory and the dominion into the ages of the ages. Truly.

7. Behold, he comes with the clouds and every eye will see him, even the men who pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail against him. Yea, Truly.

8. I am the Alpha and the Omega, says Lord, the God who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.

9. I John, your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance in Christ Jesus, happened to be on the isle that is called Patmos because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.

10. I became in spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice like a trumpet

11. saying, What thou see, write in a book and send to the seven congregations: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned there to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands.

13. And in the midst of the seven lampstands, resembling a son of man, he who was clothed down to the foot, and girded about with a golden belt at the breasts.

14. And his head and hair were white as wool, white as snow, and his eyes as a flame of fire,

15. and his feet resembling highly refined metal, as in a furnace having been fiery hot, and his voice as the sound of many waters,

16. and having in his right hand seven stars, and a sharp two-edged sword coming out of his mouth. And the sight of him was as the sun shines in its strength.

17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not, I am the first and the last,

18. and he who lives. And I became dead, and behold, I am living into the ages of the ages. Truly. And I have the keys of death and of Hades.

19. Therefore write the things that thou saw, and things that are, and things that are going to happen after these things.

20. The mystery of the seven stars that thou saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are agents of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands that thou saw are the seven congregations.

## Revelation 2

1. To the agent of the congregation in Ephesus write, These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:

2. I know thy works, and thy toil, and thy perseverance, and that thou cannot tolerate evil, and thou examined those who say themselves to be apostles, and are not, and found them false.

3. And thou have perseverance. And thou endured because of my name, and did not become weary.

4. Nevertheless, I have against thee because thou left thy first love.

5. Remember therefore from where thou have fallen, and repent and do the first works. And if not, I come to thee quickly, and will move thy lampstand out of its place, if thou do not repent.

6. But this thou have, that thou hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. To him who overcomes, I will give him to eat from the tree of life that is in the midst of the Paradise of my God.

8. And to the agent of the congregation in Smyrna write, These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived:

9. I know thy works and tribulation and poverty (but thou are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say themselves to be Jews, and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

10. Fear none of the things that thou are going to suffer. Behold, the devil is indeed going to cast some of you into prison, so that ye may be tried, and ye will have tribulation ten days. Become thou faithful until death, and I will

11. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. He who overcomes will, no, not be hurt from the second death.

12. And to the agent of the congregation in Pergamos write, These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:

13. I know thy works, and where thou dwell, where Satan's throne is. And thou hold firm my name, and did not deny my faith in the days in which Antipas was my faithful witness, who was killed among you where Satan dwells.

14. But I have a few things against thee, because thou have there men who adhere to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, even to eat idol sacrifices, and to fornicate.

15. So also thou have men who likewise adhere to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

16. Repent therefore, and if not I come to thee quickly, and will war against them with the sword of my mouth.

17. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. To him who overcomes, I will give him to eat of the hidden manna. And I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which none knows

18. And to the agent of the congregation in Thyatira write, These things says the Son of God, who has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet resembling highly refined metal:

19. I know thy works, and thy love and faith and service and perseverance. And thy last works are more than the first.

20. Nevertheless, I have against thee that thou tolerate thy woman Jezebel. She calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and leads astray my bondmen to fornicate, and to eat idol sacrifices.

21. And I gave her time so that she would repent, and she did not want to repent of her fornication.

22. Behold, I throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, if they do not repent of her works.

23. And I will kill her children in death. And all the congregations will know that I am he who searches the inner feelings and hearts. And I will give to you--to each--according to your works.

24. But I say to you, to those remaining in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who do not know, as they say, the deep things of Satan, I do not cast upon you another burden.

25. But hold firm what ye have until I come.

26. And he who overcomes, and he who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.

27. And he will tend them with a rod of iron (they will be shattered like ceramic vessels), as I also have received from my Father.

28. And I will give him the morning star.

29. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

## Revelation 3

1. And to the agent of the congregation in Sardis write, These things says he who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou have a name that thou live, and thou are dead.

2. Become thou watchful, and strengthen the remaining things that thou were going to throw away, for I have not found thy works made complete before my God.

3. Remember therefore how thou have received and heard, and be on guard, and repent. If therefore thou will not watch, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou will, no, not know what hour I will come upon thee.

4. But thou have a few names in Sardis who did not defile their garments. And they will walk with me in white, because they are worthy.

5. He who overcomes, this man will be clothed in white garments, and I will, no, not erase his name out of the book of life. And I will acknowledge his name before my Father, and before his agents.

6. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

7. And to the agent of the congregation in Philadelphia write, These things says the Holy, the True, he who has the key of David, who opens, and none will shut it except he who opens, and none will open:

8. I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee an opened door that none is able to shut it, because thou have little power, and thou keep my word, and did not deny my name.

9. Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, those who say themselves to be Jews, and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them so that they will come and bow down before thy feet, and may know that I have loved thee.

10. Because thou keep the word of my perseverance, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole inhabited world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.

11. I come quickly, hold firm what thou have, so that none may take thy crown.

12. He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will, no, not go out any more. And I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem (it comes down out of the

13. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

14. And to the agent of the congregation in Laodicea write, These things says the Truly, the faithful and TRUE witness, the primacy of the creation of God:

15. I know thy works, that thou are neither cold nor hot. O that thou were cold or hot.

16. So because thou are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to spew thee out of my mouth.

17. Because thou say, I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing, and do not know that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.

18. I counsel thee to buy from me gold refined from fire, so that thou may become wealthy, and white garments, so that thou may clothe thyself, and the shame of thy nakedness may not be made known, and eye-salve, so that thou may anoin

19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me.

21. He who overcomes, I will give him to sit with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne.

22. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

## Revelation 4

1. After these things I looked, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard like a trumpet, speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show thee what must happen after these things.

2. And straightaway I became in spirit. And behold, a throne was set in heaven, and him sitting upon the throne

3. similar in appearance to a jasper and a sardius stone. And a rainbow was around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.

4. And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones were sitting twenty-four elders clothed in white garments, and golden crowns upon their heads.

5. And out of the throne proceeds lightnings and voices and thunders. And seven lamps of fire burned before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

6. And before the throne was like a glassy sea similar to crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and all around the throne, were four beings containing eyes in front and back.

7. And the first being was similar to a lion, and the second being was similar to a young bull, and the third being having a face like a man, and the fourth being was similar to a flying eagle.

8. And the four beings, one by one, each having six wings, are full of eyes around and inside. And they have no cessation day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord, the Almighty God, he was, and who is, and who is coming.

9. And whenever the beings give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, he who lives into the ages of the ages,

10. the twenty-four elders would fall down before him who sits on the throne, and would worship him who lives into the ages of the ages, and would cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

11. Thou are worthy, our Lord and God, the Holy, to take the glory and the honor and the power, because thou created all things, and because by thy will they are, and were created.

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw at the right hand of him who sits on the throne a book, written inside and outside, sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a powerful agent proclaiming in a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals of it?

3. And none in heaven above nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the book or to see in it.

4. And I wept much because none was found worthy to open the book or to see in it.

5. And one of the elders says to me, Weep not, behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, overcame to open the book and the seven seals of it.

6. And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four beings, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, like it had been killed, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God being sent forth into all

7. And he came and took it out of the right hand of him who sits on the throne.

8. And when he took the book, the four beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls containing incense, which are the prayers of the sanctified.

9. And they sing a new song, saying, Thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals of it, because thou were killed and purchased us from God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.

10. And thou made them kings and priests to our God, and they will reign over the earth.

11. And I looked, and I heard as a voice of many agents all around the throne and the beings and the elders. And the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands,

12. saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that has been killed to receive the power, and wealth, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing!

13. And every creature that is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and is in the sea, and things in them all, I heard saying, The blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion is to him who sits upon the th

14. And the four beings were saying the Truly. And the elders fell down and worshiped.

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals. And I heard one of the four beings saying like the sound of thunder, Come and see.

2. And behold, a white horse, and he who sits on it having a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering, and so that he might conquer.

3. And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second being saying, Come.

4. And another horse came forth, fiery red. And it was given to him (to him who sits on it) to take peace from the earth, so that they would kill each other. And a great sword was given to him.

5. And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third being saying, Come and see. And behold, a black horse, and he who sits on it having a balance in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beings saying, A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius. And thou may not harm the olive oil and the wine.

7. And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth being saying, Come and see.

8. And behold, a green horse, and he who sits on top of it. His name was Death, and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with starvation, and with what is d

9. And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of the Lamb that they held.

10. And they cried out in a great voice, saying, Master, Holy and True, how long do thou not judge and avenge our blood from those who dwell on the earth?

11. And a white robe was given to them each, and it was said to them that they should still rest a time, until also their fellow bondmen, and their brothers, and those going to be killed as they too, would be fulfilled.

12. And I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred, and the sun became black as hairy sackcloth, and the whole moon became as blood.

13. And the stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree that casts its unripe figs being shaken by a great wind.

14. And the sky departed as a scroll being rolled up. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

15. And the kings of the earth, and the rulers, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.

16. And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.

17. Because the great day of his wrath has come, and who is able to stand?

## Revelation 7

1. And after this I saw four agents standing at the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that wind would not blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.

2. And I saw another agent ascending from the sun-rising, having a seal of the living God. And he cried out in a great voice to the four agents to whom it was given to them to harm the earth and the sea,

3. saying, Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we may seal the bondmen of our God on their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of those sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel.

5. Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand from the tribe of Gad,

6. twelve thousand from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand from the tribe of Manasseh,

7. twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand from the tribe of Issachar,

8. twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand from the tribe of Benjamin, were sealed.

9. After these things, I looked and lo, a great multitude, which none could number, out of every nation, and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their ha

10. and crying out in a great voice, saying, Salvation is in our God who sits upon the throne, and in the Lamb!

11. And all the agents had stood all around the throne, and the elders, and the four beings, and they fell before his throne on their faces, and worshiped God,

12. saying, Truly! Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and strength, is for our God into the ages of the ages. Truly!

13. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these who are clothed in white robes, and where did they come from?

14. And I said to him, My lord, thou know. And he said to me, These are those coming out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

15. Because of this they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple. And he who sits on the throne will dwell among them.

16. They will hunger no more, nor will they thirst any more. The sun will, no, not fall upon them, nor any heat.

17. Because the Lamb in the midst of the throne will tend them, and will lead them to fountains of waters of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

## Revelation 8

1. And when he opened the seventh seal, silence occurred in heaven, like half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven agents who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

3. And another agent came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer. And much incense was given to him, so that he would give with the prayers of all the sanctified upon the golden altar before the throne.

4. And the vapor of the incense, with the prayers of the sanctified, ascended before God out of the agent's hand.

5. And the agent who took the censer, also filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it to the earth. And there occurred thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

6. And the seven agents who have the seven trumpets prepared themselves so that they might sound.

7. And the first sounded, and there occurred hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth. And the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burn

8. And the second agent sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood,

9. and the third part of the creatures in the sea (those having lives) died, and the third part of the ships was destroyed.

10. And the third agent sounded, and a great star fell from the heaven burning like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the springs of the waters.

11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood oil. And the third part of the waters developed into wormwood oil, and many of the men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.

12. And the fourth agent sounded, and the third part of the sun was struck, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them would be darkened. And the day did not shine the third part of

13. And I looked, and I heard one eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying in a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth from the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three agents who are going to sound.

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth agent sounded, and I saw a star fallen from the sky to the earth. And the key of the pit of the abyss was given to him.

2. And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the pit, like smoke of a burning furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit.

3. And locusts came forth out of the smoke upon the earth, and power was given to them, like the scorpions of the earth have power.

4. And it was told them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor anything green, nor any tree, except the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.

5. And it was given them that they would not kill them, but that they would be tormented five months. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.

6. And in those days men will seek death, and will, no, not find it. And they will long to die, and death will flee from them.

7. And the likeness of the locusts was similar to horses prepared for battle. And upon their heads were like golden crowns, and their faces were as men's faces.

8. And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as of lions.

9. And they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.

10. And they have tails similar to scorpions, and stings. And in their tails they have power to hurt men five months.

11. Having a king over them, the agent of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.

12. One woe is departed, behold, two woes yet come after these.

13. And the sixth agent sounded, and I heard a voice, one from the four horns of the golden altar before God,

14. saying to the sixth agent who has the trumpet, Loose the four agents who have been bound at the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four agents were loosed, who were prepared for the hour and for the day and month and year, so that they would kill the third part of men.

16. And the number of the armies of the horsemen was ten thousands of ten thousands. I heard the number of them.

17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sit on them having breastplates fiery red, and of hyacinth color, and sulphurous. And the heads of the horses are like heads of lions, and out of their mouths come fire and smo

18. By these three plagues the third part of men was killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone coming out of their mouths.

19. For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails. For their tails are similar to serpents, having heads, and by them they injure.

20. And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they would not worship the demons, and the golden and silver and brass and stone and wooden idols, which can neither

21. And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw a mighty agent coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire,

2. and having in his hand an opened book. And he placed his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth.

3. And he cried out in a great voice as a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their voices.

4. And when the seven thunders uttered, I was going to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up what the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.

5. And the agent whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth raised his right hand to heaven,

6. and swore by him who lives into the ages of the ages, who created the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that time would be no more.

7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh agent, when he is going to sound, and the mystery of God is finished, as he declared the good-news to his bondmen the prophets.

8. And the voice that I heard from heaven was again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book that has been opened in the hand of the agent who stands upon the sea and upon the earth.

9. And I went to the agent, telling him to give me the little book. And he says to me, Take and eat it. And it will make thy belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in thy mouth.

10. And I took the book out of the agent's hand, and ate it. And it was sweet as honey in my mouth, and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.

11. And he says to me, Thou must prophesy again against many peoples, and against nations and tongues and kings.

## Revelation 11

1. And there was given me a reed similar to a rod, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship in it.

2. And leave out the court outside the temple, and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations. And they will trample the holy city forty-two months.

3. And I will give to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth.

4. These men are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, having stood before the Lord of the earth.

5. And if any man wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if any man wants to harm them, he must be killed this way.

6. These men have authority to shut the sky, so that it may not rain the days of their prophecy. And they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they may desire.

7. And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the abyss will make war with them, and he will overcome them and kill them.

8. And their corpses are in the thoroughfare of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.

9. And out of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations they see their corpses three and a half days. And they will not allow their corpses to be put in a sepulcher.

10. And those who dwell upon the earth rejoice over them, and will celebrate, and will give gifts to each other, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.

11. And after the three and a half days a spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those who watched them.

12. And I heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them.

13. And in that day a great earthquake occurred, and the tenth part of the city fell. And seven thousand names of men were killed in the earthquake. And the rest became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14. The second woe departed. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.

15. And the seventh agent sounded, and great voices occurred in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he will reign into the ages of the ages.

16. And the twenty-four elders who sit before the throne of God, on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshiped God,

17. saying, We thank thee, Lord God Almighty, who is and was, because thou have taken thy great power and reigned.

18. And the nations were angry. And thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to thy bondmen the prophets, and to the sanctified, and to those who fear thy name, the small and the great, and to destr

19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord was seen in his temple. And there occurred lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and great hail.

## Revelation 12

1. And a great sign was seen in heaven. A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars upon her head.

2. And having in her womb, she cried out, suffering birth pains, and suffering to give birth.

3. And another sign was seen in heaven. And behold, a great fiery dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads.

4. And his tail drags the third part of the stars of the sky, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was going to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.

5. And she gave birth to a son, a male who was going to tend all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was taken up to God and to his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place there prepared by God, so that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred sixty days.

7. And war developed in heaven: Michael and his agents to fight with the dragon. And the dragon and his agents fought.

8. And he did not prevail, nor was a place found for him any more in heaven.

9. And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, called the Devil and Satan, he who leads the whole world astray. He was cast out to the earth, and his agents were cast out with him.

10. And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying, Now it came to pass, the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. Because the accuser of our brothers was cast out, who accuses them before

11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony. And they loved not their life to the point of death.

12. Rejoice because of this, O heavens, and ye who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.

13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male.

14. And two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place. So that she might be nourished there for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent cast water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might make her carried away by the flood.

16. And the earth helped the woman. And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon cast out of his mouth.

17. And the dragon was angry toward the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, those keeping the commandments of God, and having the testimony of Jesus.

## Revelation 13

1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea having ten horns, and seven heads, and ten diadems upon its horns, and upon its heads names of blasphemy.

2. And the beast that I saw was similar to a leopard. And its feet were like a bear, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave to it his power, and his throne, and great authority.

3. And one of its heads was as in death, having been killed. And its deadly wound was healed. And the whole earth marveled behind the beast.

4. And they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast, and who is able to war against it?

5. And a mouth was given to it speaking great things and blasphemy. And authority was given it to make war forty-two months.

6. And it opened its mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, those who dwell in heaven.

7. And it was given it to make war with the sanctified, and to overcome them. And authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to it.

8. And all who dwell upon the earth will worship it, whose name has not been written in the book of life of the Lamb who was killed from the foundation of the world.

9. If any man has an ear, let him hear.

10. If any man keeps in captivity, he goes. If any man kills with a sword, he must be killed with a sword. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the sanctified.

11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and it had two horns similar to a lamb, and it spoke like a dragon.

12. And it exercises all the authority of the first beast before it. And it made the earth and those who dwell in it, so that they would worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed.

13. And it does great signs, so that even fire would come down out of the sky upon the earth in the sight of men.

14. And it leads my kind astray (those dwelling on the earth) because of the signs that were given it to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast that had the sword-wound and live

15. And it was given it, to give a spirit to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would both speak, and would make as many as would not ever worship the image of the beast be killed.

16. And it makes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the bondmen, that they would give them marks on their right hand, or on their foreheads.

17. And so that not any man can buy or sell unless having the mark--the name of the beast or the number of its name.

18. Here is wisdom: He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is a number of a man. And its number is 666

## Revelation 14

1. And I looked, and lo, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with it a number, a hundred and forty-four thousand, having its name and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a sound from heaven as a sound of many waters, and as a sound of great thunder. And the voice that I heard was as of harpers harping with their harps.

3. And they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four beings and the elders. And none could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, those who have been redeemed from the earth.

4. These are men who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were out of men purchased by Jesus, a first fruit to God and to the Lamb.

5. And no lie was found in their mouth, for they are unblemished.

6. And I saw an agent flying in mid-heaven having eternal good-news to proclaim to those who sit on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,

7. saying in a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. And worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and springs of waters.

8. And another, a second agent, followed, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen. She has given all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

9. And another agent, a third, followed them, saying in a great voice, If any man worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,

10. he also himself will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which was mixed undiluted in the cup of his anger. And he will be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy agents and before the Lamb.

11. And the smoke of their torment ascends into the ages of ages. And they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and its image, and if any man receives the mark of its name.

12. Here is the perseverance of the sanctified. Here are those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in Lord from henceforth. Yea, says the Spirit, so that they may rest from their toils, and their works follow with them.

14. And I looked, and behold, a white cloud. And sitting upon the cloud, like a son of man, having a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.

15. And another agent came out from the temple, crying out in a great voice to him who sits on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle and reap, because the hour has come to reap, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.

16. And he who sits on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17. And another agent came out from the temple in heaven, also himself having a sharp sickle.

18. And another agent came out from the altar having power over the fire. And he cried out in a great shout to him who has the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the grapevine of the earth, be

19. And the agent sent his sickle to the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

20. And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out from the winepress, up to the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven agents having seven plagues, the last, because in them the wrath of God is ended.

2. And I saw like a glassy sea mingled with fire, and those who were victorious over the beast and over its image and over the number of its name, standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.

3. And they sing the song of Moses the bondman of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, righteous and TRUE are thy ways, thou King of the nations.

4. Who will, no, not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name, because thou alone are holy? Because all the nations will come and worship before thee, because thy righteous deeds were made known.

5. And after these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.

6. And the seven agents came forth from the temple having the seven plagues, who were clothed in pure bright linen, and golden belts girded around their breasts.

7. And one of the four beings gave to the seven agents seven golden bowls containing the wrath of God who lives into the ages of the ages.

8. And the temple became full of vapor from the glory of God and from his power. And none was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven agents were ended.

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven agents, Go ye and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.

2. And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth, and a bad and evil sore developed upon the men who have the mark of the beast and who worship its image.

3. And the second agent poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like of a dead man, and every living soul in the sea died.

4. And the third agent poured out his bowl into the rivers and into the springs of the waters, and they became blood.

5. And I heard the agent of the waters saying, Thou are righteous who is and was--the Divine--because thou judged these things.

6. Because they poured out the blood of the sanctified and prophets, and thou have given them blood to drink--they are deserving.

7. And I heard the altar saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty, TRUE and righteous are thy judgments.

8. And the fourth agent poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given him to scorch men with fire.

9. And the men were scorched with great heat. And the men blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues, and they did not repent to give him glory.

10. And the fifth agent poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and its kingdom became darkened, and they gnawed their tongues from the anguish.

11. And they blasphemed the God of heaven from their pains and from their sores. And they did not repent of their works.

12. And the sixth agent poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the sun-rising might be prepared.

13. And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the FALSE prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.

14. For they are spirits of demons, doing signs that go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together to the battle of that great day of the Almighty God.

15. (Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, so that he may not walk naked, and they see his shame.)

16. And he gathered them together into the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.

17. And the seventh agent poured out his bowl upon the air, and a great voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, out of the throne, saying, It has come to pass.

18. And there occurred lightnings, and thunders, and voices. And a great earthquake occurred, such as did not happen from that time men came to be upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, so great.

19. And the great city became in three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And the great Babylon was remembered before God, to give to it the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.

20. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

21. And great hail, like a talent weight, descended out of the sky upon men. And the men blasphemed God from the plague of the hail, because the plague of it was exceedingly great.

## Revelation 17

1. And one of the seven agents who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great whore who sits upon the many waters

2. with whom the kings of the earth fornicated, and those who inhabit the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.

3. And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast containing names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup containing abominations and the filthy things of her fornication,

5. and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF WHORES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

6. And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the sanctified, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And having seen her, I wondered with great amazement.

7. And the agent said to me, Why did thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.

8. The beast that thou saw was, and is not, and is going to ascend out of the abyss and go into destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will wonder, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of th

9. Here is the mind that has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains where the woman sits on them.

10. And there are seven kings, the five are fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain a little while.

11. And the beast that was, and is not, he also is an eighth, and is of the seven, and he goes into destruction.

12. And the ten horns that thou saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.

13. These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.

14. These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those with him are the called and chosen and faithful.

15. And he says to me, The waters that thou saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

16. And the ten horns that thou saw, and the beast, these will hate the whore, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her with fire.

17. For God gave in their hearts to do his will. Even to do one will, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God would be ended.

18. And the woman whom thou saw is the great city having reign over the kings of the earth.

## Revelation 18

1. And after these things I saw another agent coming down out of heaven having great authority, and the earth was illuminated from his glory.

2. And he cried out in a mighty voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, and became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird.

3. Because all the nations have drunk from the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the kings of the earth fornicated with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her wantonness.

4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, so that ye may not participate with her sins, and that ye may not receive from her plagues.

5. Because her sins have reached as far as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.

6. Render to her as she also rendered to you, and double to her two-fold according to her works. In the cup that she mixed, mix two-fold for her.

7. In an amount she glorified herself and lived wantonly, give her so much torment and grief, because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will, no, not see grief.

8. Because of this her plagues will come in one day, death, and grief, and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, because strong is Lord, the God who judged her.

9. And the kings of the earth who fornicated and lived wantonly with her, will weep and will beat their breasts for her when they see the smoke of her burning,

10. having stood from afar because of the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! Because thy judgment has come in one hour.

11. And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her, because no man buys their merchandise any more,

12. merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and mar

13. and cinnamon, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and olive oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and sheep, and cattle, and horses, and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.

14. And the fruit of the lust of thy soul have departed from thee. And all the fat and bright things are destroyed from thee. And thou will, no, not find them any more.

15. The merchants of these things who became rich from her will stand from afar because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,

16. and saying, Alas, alas, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls!

17. Because in one hour such great wealth was devastated. And every shipmaster, and every man who sails anywhere, and sailors, and as many as work by sea, stood from afar

18. and cried out seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like the great city?

19. And they cast dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, and saying, Alas, alas, the great city in which all who had ships in the sea became rich from her luxuriance! Because in one hour she was devastated.

20. Be glad over her, thou heaven, and the sanctified, and the apostles, and the prophets, because God has decreed your judgment of her.

21. And one mighty agent took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus in violence Babylon the great city will be thrown down, and will, no, not be found any more.

22. And a sound of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters will, no, not be heard in thee any more. And every craftsman of every craft will, no, not be found in thee any more. And a sound of a millstone will, no, not be

23. And the light of a lamp will, no, not shine in thee any more. And a voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will, no, not be heard in thee any more. Because thy merchants were the chief men of the earth, because all the nations were l

24. And in her was found blood of prophets, and of the sanctified, and of all who have been killed upon the earth.

## Revelation 19

1. And after these things I heard as a great sound of a large multitude in heaven, saying, Praise Lord, the salvation, and the power, and the glory of our God!

2. Because TRUE and righteous are his judgments, because he has judged the great whore who ruined the earth by her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his bondmen from her hand.

3. And a second time they said, Praise Lord! And the smoke of her ascended into the ages of the ages.

4. And the twenty-four elders and the four beings fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, Truly! Praise Lord!

5. And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise ye our God, all his bondmen and those who fear him, the small and the great.

6. And I heard as the sound of a large multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Praise Lord! Because Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.

7. We should be glad and rejoice and give the glory to him, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has prepared herself.

8. And it was given her that she clothe herself in fine linen, bright and pure. For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the sanctified.

9. And he says to me, Write, Blessed are those who have been called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the TRUE sayings of God.

10. And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See thou not. I am a fellow bondman of thee and thy brothers, those who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophe

11. And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he who sits upon it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.

12. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems having names written, and a name written that none knows except he himself,

13. and clothed in a garment dipped in blood. And his name is called The Word of God.

14. And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, pure white.

15. And a sharp two-edged sword comes out of his mouth, so that he would smite the nations by it. And he will tend them with a rod of iron. And he treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath of the anger of the Almighty God.

16. And he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.

17. And I saw one agent having stood in the sun, and he cried out in a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in mid-heaven, Come, gather together to the great supper of God,

18. so that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit upon them, and the flesh of all men, both freemen and bondmen, and both small and great.

19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war against him who sits upon the horse, and against his army.

20. And the beast was taken, and the FALSE prophet with it who did the signs in its sight by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who worship its image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire

21. And the others were killed by the sword that comes forth out of his mouth (of him who sits upon the horse), and all the birds were filled from their flesh.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an agent coming down out of heaven having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.

2. And he seized the dragon, the old serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, who leads the whole world astray, and bound him a thousand years.

3. And he cast him into the abyss, and locked and sealed over him, so that he would no longer lead the nations astray until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be loosed for a little time.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them. And judgment was given to them and the souls of those who were beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not worship the beast nor his image,

5. The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.

6. Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. On these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will reign with him a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed out of his prison.

8. And he will come forth to lead astray the nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the battle, of whom the number of them is as the sand of the sea.

9. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the encampment of the sanctified and the beloved city. And fire came down out of heaven from God, and devoured them.

10. And the devil who leads them astray was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also were the beast and the FALSE prophet. And they will be tormented day and night into the ages of the ages.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and him who sits upon it, from whose face the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.

12. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the one of life. And the dead were judged from the things that were written in the books, accordi

13. And the sea gave up the dead in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead in them. And they were judged, each according to their works.

14. And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.

15. And if any man was found not written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new sky and a new earth, for the first sky and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.

2. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, having been prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people. And God himself will be with them.

4. And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And there will not be any more death, nor grief, nor crying, nor will there be any more anguish, because the former things are gone.

5. And he who sits upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me, Write, because these words are TRUE and faithful.

6. And he said to me, I have become, I, the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him who is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.

7. He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to me.

8. But for the cowards, and unbelieving, and sinful, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

9. And there came one of the seven agents who had the seven bowls containing the seven last plagues, and he spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the woman, the bride of the Lamb.

10. And he carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,

11. having the glory of God, the light of it similar to a most precious stone, like a jasper stone being crystal clear,

12. which has a great and high wall having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve agents, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:

13. from the east, three gates, and from the north, three gates, and from the south, three gates, and from the west, three gates.

14. And the wall of the city having twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he who spoke with me had a measure, a golden reed, so that he might measure the city, and the gates of it, and the walls of it.

16. And the city lies foursquare, and the length of it is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs, the length and the breadth and the height of it being equal.

17. And he measured the wall of it, a hundred and forty-four forearms, a measure of a man, that is, of a heavenly agent.

18. And the structure of its wall was jasper. And the city was pure gold, similar to clear glass.

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second, sapphire, the third, chalcedony, the fourth, emerald,

20. the fifth, sardonyx, the sixth, sardius, the seventh, chrysolite, the eighth, beryl, the ninth, topaz, the tenth, chrysoprase, the eleventh, jacinth, the twelfth, amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls apiece, each one of the gates was of one pearl. And the thoroughfare of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.

22. And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty is the temple of it, and the Lamb.

23. And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, so that they might shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and the light of it is the Lamb.

24. And the nations will walk by the light of it. And the kings of the earth bring to them the splendor and worth of the nations into it.

25. And the gates of it will, no, not be locked by day, for there will be no night there.

26. And they will bring the splendor and the worth of the nations into it.

27. And there will, no, not enter into it anything profane, and doing an abomination and a lie, since they are not written in the Lamb's book of life.

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, coming out from the throne of God and of the Lamb,

2. in the middle of its thoroughfare. And on this side of the river and on that was a tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit according to each month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

3. And there will be no curse there. And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his bondmen will serve him.

4. And they will see his face, and his name is on their foreheads.

5. And there will be no night there, and they have no need of a lamp and the light of sun, because Lord God will illuminate them. And they will reign into the ages of the ages.

6. And he says to me, These words are faithful and true. And Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his agent to show to his bondmen the things that must quickly come to pass.

7. And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.

8. And I am John, the man hearing and seeing these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the agent showing me these things.

9. And he says to me, See thou not. I am thy fellow bondman, and of thy brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!

10. And he says to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.

11. Let the man doing wrong still do wrong, and let the filthy man still be filthy. And let the righteous man still do righteousness, and let the holy man still be holy.

12. Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me to render to each man as his work will be.

13. I, the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

14. Blessed are those doing his commandments, so that their right will be to the tree of life, and they may enter in the gates into the city.

15. Outside are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every man who loves and makes a lie.

16. I, Jesus, have sent my agent to testify these things to you for the congregations. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star.

17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he who hears, let him say, Come. And he who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him take the water of life freely.

18. I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man should add to them, God will add to him the seven plagues that are written in this book.

19. And if any man takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life, and from the holy city, the things written in this book.

20. He who testifies these things says, Yea, I come quickly. Truly. Yea, come, Lord Jesus!

21. The grace of the Lord Jesus is with all the sanctified. Truly.
