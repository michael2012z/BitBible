# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to a commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ our hope,

2. to Timothy, a genuine child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. As I urged thee, while going to Macedonia, remain in Ephesis, so that thou might command certain men not to teach something different,

4. nor to heed myths and endless genealogies, which cause controversies rather than stewardship of God in faith.

5. But the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and non-hypocritical faith.

6. From which some having swerved have turned aside to empty talk,

7. desiring to be law teachers, understanding neither what they say, nor about what they confidently assert.

8. But we know that the law is good, if any man uses it lawfully,

9. knowing this, that law is not laid down for righteous men, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the irreverent and sinful, for the impious and profane, for father killers and mother killers, for man killers,

10. for fornicators, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine

11. according to the good-news of the glory of the blessed God, of which I was entrusted.

12. And I have gratitude to the Christ--Jesus our Lord--who empowered me, because he considered me faithful, having placed in service

13. the man who was formerly blasphemous, and a persecutor, and an aggressor. But I obtained mercy because I did it being ignorant in unbelief.

14. And the grace of our Lord was filled to overflowing with the faith and love in Christ Jesus.

15. Faithful is the saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinful men, of whom I am foremost.

16. But because of this I obtained mercy, so that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.

17. Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, alone wise, to God is honor and glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.

18. This command I set before thee, child Timothy, according to the prophecies leading the way for thee, so that by them thou might war the good warfare.

19. Holding faith and a good conscience, which some, having put away, made shipwreck about the faith,

20. of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, so that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme.

## 1 Timothy 2

1. I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men,

2. for kings and all those who are in prominence, so that we may live a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and propriety.

3. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,

4. who wants all men to be saved and to come to knowledge of truth.

5. For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Jesus Christ,

6. who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony for their own times.

7. For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth.

8. I desire therefore the men to pray in every place, lifting up devout hands, apart from anger and argument.

9. And similarly, the women to adorn themselves in disciplined decorum, with reverence and sobriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive apparel,

10. but (which is fitting for women professing godliness) through good works.

11. Let a woman learn in silence in all subjection.

12. But I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to act autonomously from a man, but to be in quietness.

13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

14. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, became in transgression.

15. But she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.

## 1 Timothy 3

1. Faithful is the saying, If any man aspires to supervision, he desires a good work.

2. The overseer therefore must be blameless, the husband of one wife, without wine, serious minded, disciplined, loving strangers, able to teach,

3. no drunkard, not a fighter, not greedy of base gain, but meek, noncontentious, no lover of money,

4. a man who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all propriety

5. (but if any man knows not how to rule his own house, how will he take care of a congregation of God?),

6. not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall into the condemnation of the devil.

7. And he must also have good testimony from those outside, lest he may fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

8. Helpers likewise, be honorable, not double-tongued, not attending to much wine, not greedy of base gain,

9. holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

10. And let these also first be proven, then being blameless, let them serve as deacons.

11. The wives likewise, be honorable, not slanderous, without wine, faithful in all things.

12. Let helpers be husbands of one wife, ruling children and their own houses well.

13. For those who serve well will acquire to themselves a good standing, and much boldness in the faith in Christ Jesus.

14. These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee sooner,

15. but if I delay, that thou may know how it is necessary to live in a house of God, which is a congregation of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.

16. And without controversy great is the mystery of piety. God was manifested in flesh, justified in spirit, seen by heavenly agents, proclaimed among nations, believed in the world, taken up in glory.

## 1 Timothy 4

1. But the Spirit says expressly that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,

2. speaking lies in hypocrisy, their own conscience having been seared with a hot iron,

3. forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods, which God created for partaking with thankfulness by those who believe and know the truth.

4. Because every creation of God is good, and nothing rejected that is received with thankfulness,

5. for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.

6. Laying these things down to the brothers, thou will be a good helper of Jesus Christ, reared up in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine that thou have followed.

7. But reject the profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself to piety.

8. For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but piety is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is coming.

9. Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance.

10. For we both labor and are reproached for this, because we have hoped in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of the faithful.

11. These things command and teach.

12. Let no man disparage thy youth, but become an example of the faithful, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

13. Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.

14. Do not neglect the gift in thee, which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.

15. Think on these things--exist within these things--so that thy progress may be visible among all.

16. Hold firm to thyself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this thou will save both thyself and those who hear thee.

## 1 Timothy 5

1. Do not rebuke an elder man, but entreat him as a father, younger men as brothers,

2. elder women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.

3. Support widows, the real widows.

4. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to be devoted to their own house, and to give back recompense to their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.

5. But the real widow, and made alone, has hoped in God, and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.

6. But she who is self-indulgent is dead while she lives.

7. And command these things, so that they may be blameless.

8. But if any man does not provide for his own, and especially those belonging his household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

9. Let no widow be enrolled under sixty years old, having become the wife of one man,

10. being testified in good works: if she has reared children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the sanctified, if she has relieved those who are afflicted, if she has followed every good work.

11. But refuse younger widows, for when they are sexually aroused, they desire of the Christ to marry,

12. which has condemnation because they have disregarded the original pledge.

13. And also at the same time they learn to be idle, roving the houses, and not only idle, but also babbling and meddlesome, speaking things that they ought not.

14. I desire therefore the younger women to marry, to bear children, to manage house, to give not one occasion to him who opposes on account of slander.

15. For some have already turned aside after Satan.

16. If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them, and let not the congregation be burdened, so that it may relieve the real widows.

17. Let the elders who rule well be regarded worthy of double compensation, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.

18. For the scripture says thou shall not muzzle an ox that is threshing. And the workman is worthy of his wage.

19. Accept no accusation against an elder, except at two or three witnesses.

20. Those who sin, rebuke in the sight of all, so that the others may also have fear.

21. I solemnly testify before God, and Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen agents, that thou keep these things without prejudice, doing nothing from partiality.

22. Lay hands hastily on no man, nor contribute to other sins. Keep thyself pure.

23. No longer drink water, but use a little wine because of thy stomach and thy frequent weaknesses.

24. The sins of some men are evident, leading to judgment, but also for some they follow after.

25. Likewise also good works are evident, and those faring otherwise cannot be hid.

## 1 Timothy 6

1. Let bondmen, as many as are under a yoke, regard their own masters worthy of all respect, so that the name of God and the doctrine may not be blasphemed.

2. And those who have believing masters, let them not disparage them because they are brothers, instead let them serve more because they are believers and beloved--those who are recipients of the benefit. Teach and exhort these things

3. If any man teaches something different, and does not associate with wholesome words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine according to piety,

4. he is puffed up, understanding nothing, but doting about disputes and word controversies, from which develop envy, strife, revilings, evil surmisings,

5. constant frictions of men corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing piety to be a means of gain. Withdraw from such.

6. But piety with contentment is great gain,

7. for we brought nothing into the world. It is clear that neither can we carry anything out,

8. but having food and covering we will be content with these.

9. But those who want to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, which sink men in destruction and ruin.

10. For the love of money is a root of all the evils, of which some aspiring have wandered from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

11. But thou, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, mildness.

12. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life for which thou are called, and confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.

13. I command thee in the sight of God, who makes all live, and of Christ Jesus, who testified to Pontius Pilate the good confession,

14. that thou keep the commandment, without spot, blameless, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ,

15. which he will show in his own times, the blessed and only Potentate, the King of those who are kings, and Lord of those who are lords,

16. who alone has immortality, dwelling in irreproachable light, whom no man has seen, nor can see, to whom is honor and eternal dominion. Truly.

17. Command the rich in the present age not to be arrogant, nor hope in the uncertainty of wealth, but in the living God, who supplies us all things abundantly for enjoyment,

18. to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share,

19. storing up for themselves a good foundation for that which is coming, so that they may take hold of the eternal life.

20. O Timothy, keep the entrustment, avoiding the profane babblings and objections of the falsely-called knowledge,

21. which some men professing have missed the mark concerning the faith. Grace is with thee. Truly.
