## 1 Kings 1

1. Now king David was old and stricken in years, and they covered him with clothes, but he did not get warm.

2. Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and take care of him. And let her lay in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warmth.

3. So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

4. And the damsel was very fair. And she took care of the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.

5. Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. And he prepared chariots for him, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.

6. And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have thou done so? And he was also a very handsome man. And he was born after Absalom.

7. And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. And, following Adonijah, they helped him.

8. But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

9. And Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel. And he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.

10. But he did not call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.

11. Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord does not know it?

12. Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou may save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.

13. Go and get thee in to king David, and say to him, Did thou not, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?

14. Behold, while thou yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

15. And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber. And the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.

16. And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What do thou want?

17. And she said to him, My lord, thou swore by LORD thy God to thy handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

18. And now, behold, Adonijah reigns, and thou, my lord the king, do not know it.

19. And he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army, but he has not called Solomon thy servant.

20. And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.

21. Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be considered offenders.

22. And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.

23. And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.

24. And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

25. For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And, behold, they are eating and drinking before him,

26. But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, he has not called.

27. Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou have not shown to thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?

28. Then king David answered and said, Call Bathsheba to me. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

29. And the king swore, and said, As LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

30. truly as I swore to thee by LORD, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead. Truly so I will do this day.

31. Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.

32. And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.

33. And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.

34. And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. And blow ye the trumpet, and say, Live, king Solomon.

35. Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne, for he shall be king in my stead. And I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.

36. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen. LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so [too].

37. As LORD has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.

38. So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.

39. And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, Live, king Solomon.

40. And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.

41. And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?

42. While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, Come in, for thou are a worthy man, and bring good news.

43. And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord king David has made Solomon king.

44. And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule.

45. And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. And they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.

46. And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.

47. And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.

48. And also thus said the king, Blessed be LORD, the God of Israel, who has given one of my seed to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.

49. And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and every man went his way.

50. And Adonijah feared because of Solomon. And he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

51. And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon, for, lo, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.

52. And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth, but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.

53. So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.

## 1 Kings 2

1. Now the days of David drew near that he should die. And he charged Solomon his son, saying,

2. I am going the way of all the earth. Be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man,

3. and keep the charge of LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, [and] his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou may prosper in all t

4. That LORD may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee a man on the throne of Is

5. Moreover thou also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in pea

6. Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and do not let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.

7. But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at thy table, for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.

8. And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by LORD, sayin

9. Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for thou are a wise man, and thou will know what thou ought to do to him, and thou shall bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.

10. And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.

11. And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

12. And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established greatly.

13. Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do thou come peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.

14. He said moreover, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Say on.

15. And he said, Thou know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned about, and has become my brother's, for it was his from LORD.

16. And now I ask one petition of thee; do not deny me. And she said to him, Say on.

17. And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king (for he will not say no thee), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.

18. And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.

19. Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother. And she sat on his

20. Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; do not deny me. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny thee.

21. And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.

22. And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my elder brother, even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of

23. Then king Solomon swore by LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.

24. Now therefore as LORD lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.

25. And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he fell upon him so that he died.

26. And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Get thee to Anathoth, to thine own fields, for thou are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou bore the ark of lord LORD before David my father, and be

27. So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to LORD, that he might fulfill the word of LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

28. And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he did not turn after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

29. And it was told king Solomon, Joab has fled to the tent of LORD, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.

30. And Benaiah came to the tent of LORD, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

31. And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him, that thou may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.

32. And LORD will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David did not know it, [namely], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the a

33. So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed forever. But to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from LORD.

34. Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and killed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.

35. And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army. And the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.

36. And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there anywhere.

37. For on the day thou go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shall surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

38. And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.

39. And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.

40. And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. And Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.

41. And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.

42. And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou go out, and walk abroad anywhere, thou shall surely die? And thou said to

43. Why then have thou not kept the oath of LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?

44. The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou know all the iniquity which thy heart is privy to, what thou did to David my father. Therefore LORD shall return thy iniquity upon thine own head.

45. But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before LORD forever.

46. So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And he went out, and fell upon him so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

## 1 Kings 3

1. And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round ab

2. Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of LORD until those days.

3. And Solomon loved LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father. Only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

4. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon that altar.

5. In Gibeon LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

6. And Solomon said, Thou have shown to thy servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee. And thou have kept for him this great

7. And now, O LORD my God, thou have made thy servant king instead of David my father. And I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.

8. And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou have chosen, a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.

9. Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to judge this thy great people?

10. And the speech pleased LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.

11. And God said to him, Because thou have asked this thing, and have not asked for thyself long life, neither have asked riches for thyself, nor have asked the life of thine enemies, but have asked for thyself understanding to discern

12. behold, I have done according to thy word. Lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there has been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like thee.

13. And I have also given thee that which thou have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like thee all thy days.

14. And if thou will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David walked, then I will lengthen thy days.

15. And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

16. Then two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him.

17. And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. And I was delivered of a child with her in the house.

18. And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also. And we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, except we two in the house.

19. And this woman's child died in the night, because she lay upon it.

20. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.

21. And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead. But when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.

22. And the other woman said, No, but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And the other woman said, No, but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.

23. Then the king said, The one says, This is my son that lives, and thy son is the dead. And the other says, No, but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.

24. And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.

25. And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.

26. Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine.

27. Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and by no means kill it; she is the mother of it.

28. And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged. And they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.

## 1 Kings 4

1. And king Solomon was king over all Israel.

2. And these were the rulers whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;

3. Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;

4. and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;

5. and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, [and] the king's friend;

6. and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to task work.

7. And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel who provided provisions for the king and his household. Each man had to make provision for a month in the year.

8. And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;

9. Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;

10. Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him [pertained] Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);

11. Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);

12. Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;

13. Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him [pertained] the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; [even] to him [pertained] the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bars);

14. Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;

15. Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife);

16. Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;

17. Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;

18. Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;

19. Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan, and [he was] the only officer who was in the land.

20. Judah and Israel were as many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.

21. And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

22. And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,

23. ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.

24. For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side of the River. And he had peace on all sides round about him.

25. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.

26. And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

27. And those officers provided provisions for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.

28. Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds they brought to the place where [the officers] were, every man according to his charge.

29. And God gave Solomon exceedingly much wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.

30. And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

31. For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame was in all the nations round about.

32. And he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five.

33. And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

34. And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.

## 1 Kings 5

1. And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father, for Hiram was ever a devotee of David.

2. And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

3. Thou know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until LORD put them under the soles of his feet.

4. But now LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.

5. And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of LORD my God, as LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy place, he shall build the house for my name.

6. Now therefore command thou that they cut for me cedar trees out of Lebanon. And my servants shall be with thy servants. And I will give thee wages for thy servants according to all that thou shall say, for thou know that there is n

7. And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.

8. And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard [that] which thou have sent to me. I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.

9. My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. And I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that thou shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shall receive them. And thou shall

10. So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.

11. And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil; thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.

12. And LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two made a league together.

13. And king Solomon raised a conscription out of all Israel, and the conscription was thirty thousand men.

14. And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses. They were in Lebanon a month, and at home two months. And Adoniram was over the men subject to task work.

15. And Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were hewers in the mountains,

16. besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work: three thousand and three hundred who bore rule over the people that labored in the work.

17. And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with shaped stone.

18. And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites fashioned them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.

## 1 Kings 6

1. And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to bui

2. And the house which king Solomon built for LORD, the length of it was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty [cubits], and the height of it thirty cubits,

3. and the porch in front of the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, [and] ten cubits was the breadth of it in front of the house.

4. And he made windows of fixed lattice-work for the house.

5. And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle. And he made side-chambers round about.

6. The lowest story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad, for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened i

7. And the house, when it was being built, was built of stone made ready at the quarry. And there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built.

8. The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house. And they went up by winding stairs into the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.

9. So he built the house, and finished it. And he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.

10. And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

11. And the word of LORD came to Solomon, saying,

12. Concerning this house that thou are building, if thou will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my word with thee, which I spoke to David thy father.

13. And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.

14. So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

15. And he built the walls of the house inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood. And he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.

16. And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls [of the ceiling]. He built [them] for it inside, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.

17. And the house, that is, the temple in front of [the oracle], was forty cubits [long].

18. And there was cedar on the house inside, carved with knops and open flowers. All was cedar; there was no stone seen.

19. And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house inside, to set there the ark of the covenant of LORD.

20. And inside the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height of it. And he overlaid it with pure gold. And he covered the altar with cedar.

21. So Solomon overlaid the house inside with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across before the oracle, and he overlaid it with gold.

22. And the whole house he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.

23. And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.

24. And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub. From the outermost part of the one wing to the outermost part of the other were ten cubits.

25. And the other cherub was ten cubits; both of the cherubim were of one measure and one form.

26. The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so it was of the other cherub.

27. And he set the cherubim inside the inner house. And the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched

28. And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.

29. And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.

30. And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.

31. And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood. The lintel [and] door-posts were a fifth part [of the wall].

32. So [he made] two doors of olive-wood. And he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. And he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.

33. So he also made for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood out of a fourth part [of the wall],

34. and two doors of fir-wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.

35. And he carved [thereon] cherubim and palm trees and open flowers. And he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.

36. And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.

37. In the fourth year the foundation of the house of LORD was laid, in the month Ziv.

38. And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all the parts of it, and according to all the fashion of it. So he was seven years in building it.

## 1 Kings 7

1. And Solomon was thirteen years building his own house, and he finished all his house.

2. For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon. The length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.

3. And it was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams that were upon the pillars, fifteen in a row.

4. And there were beams in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks.

5. And all the doors and posts were made square with beams, and window was opposite window in three ranks.

6. And he made the porch of pillars. The length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it thirty cubits, and a porch in front of them, and pillars and a threshold in front of them.

7. And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment. And it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.

8. And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch was of the like work. He also made a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like this porch.

9. All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.

10. And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

11. And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.

12. And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams, like the inner court of the house of LORD, and the porch of the house.

13. And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

14. He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a workman in brass. And he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wroug

15. For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece. And a line of twelve cubits encompassed each of them around.

16. And he made two capitals of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.

17. There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.

18. So he made the pillars. And there were two rows round about upon the one network to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars. And so he did for the other capital.

19. And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.

20. And there were capitals also above upon the two pillars, close by the protuberance which was beside the network. And the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.

21. And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. And he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.

22. And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.

23. And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits. And a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.

24. And under the brim of it round about there were knops which encompassed it, for ten cubits, encompassing the sea round about. The knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.

25. It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east. And the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts we

26. And it was a handbreadth thick. And the brim of it was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.

27. And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the height of it.

28. And the work of the bases was on this manner: They had panels, and there were panels between the ledges.

29. And on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And upon the ledges there was a pedestal above. And beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.

30. And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass. And the four corners of it had supports. Beneath the laver were the molten supports with wreaths at the side of each.

31. And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit. And the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half. And also upon the mouth of it were engravings. And their panels were foursquare, not roun

32. And the four wheels were underneath the panels. And the axletrees of the wheels were in the base. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.

33. And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.

34. And there were four supports at the four corners of each base. The supports of it were of the base itself.

35. And in the top of the base there was a round band half a cubit high. And on the top of the base the ledges of it and the panels of it were of the same.

36. And on the plates of the ledges of it, and on the panels of it, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.

37. After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.

38. And he made ten basins of brass. One basin contained forty baths. And every basin was four cubits. And upon every one of the ten bases one basin.

39. And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.

40. And Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the bowls. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of LORD:

41. the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,

42. and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars,

43. and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases,

44. and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea,

45. and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls. And all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon in the house of LORD were of burnished brass.

46. The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.

47. And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed] because they were very many; the weight of the brass could not be found out.

48. And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of LORD: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold,

49. and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,

50. and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold, and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, [namely], of the temple, of

51. Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated--the silver, and the gold, and the vessels--and put them in the treasuries of the

1. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of LORD out of the city of David, whi

2. And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.

3. And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.

4. And they brought up the ark of LORD, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; even these the priests and the Levites brought up.

5. And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.

6. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of LORD to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.

7. For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves of it above.

8. And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle. But they were not seen outside. And there they are to this day.

9. There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb when LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

10. And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of LORD,

11. so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of LORD filled the house of LORD.

12. Then Solomon spoke, LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.

13. I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in forever.

14. And the king turned his face around, and blessed all the assembly of Israel. And all the assembly of Israel stood.

15. And he said, Blessed be LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,

16. Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there, but I chose David to be over my people Israel.

17. Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of LORD, the God of Israel.

18. But LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou did well that it was in thy heart.

19. Nevertheless thou shall not build the house, but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.

20. And LORD has established his word that he spoke, for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of LORD, the God of Israel.

21. And there I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of LORD, which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.

22. And Solomon stood before the altar of LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.

23. And he said, O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with thy servants, who walk before thee with all their heart,

24. who have kept with thy servant David my father that which thou did promise him. Yea, thou spoke with thy mouth, and have fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.

25. Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou have promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to th

26. Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spoke to thy servant David my father.

27. But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. How much less this house that I have built!

28. Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee this day,

29. that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou have said, My name shall be there, to hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.

30. And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place. Yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and when thou hear, forgive.

31. If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he comes [and] swears before thine altar in this house,

32. then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

33. When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee, if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication to thee in this house,

34. then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gave to their fathers.

35. When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee, if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin when thou afflict them,

36. then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and send rain upon thy land, which thou have given to thy people for an inheritanc

37. If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blight, mildew, locust [or] caterpillar, if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness there be,

38. whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man, [or] by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house,

39. then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou know (for thou, even thou only, know the hearts of all the sons of men),

40. that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gave to our fathers.

41. Moreover concerning the foreigner who is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name's sake

42. (for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm), when he shall come and pray toward this house,

43. hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to thee for, that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as does thy people Israel, and that they may know that this ho

44. If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way thou shall send them, and they pray to LORD toward the city which thou have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name,

45. then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.

46. If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sins not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, afar off or near,

47. yet if they shall rethink themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to thee in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have

48. if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive, and pray to thee toward their land, which thou gave to their fathers, the city which thou have chosen, and t

49. then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their case,

50. and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions by which they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them

51. (for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);

52. that thine eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them whenever they cry to thee.

53. For thou separated them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spoke by Moses thy servant when thou brought our fathers out of Egypt, O lord LORD.

54. And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to LORD, he arose from before the altar of LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.

55. And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,

56. Blessed be LORD, who has given rest to his people Israel according to all that he promised. There has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.

57. LORD our God be with us as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave us, nor forsake us,

58. that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.

59. And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before LORD, be near to LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require,

60. that all the peoples of the earth may know that LORD, he is God; there is none else.

61. Let your heart therefore be perfect with LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.

62. And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before LORD.

63. And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered to LORD, twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of LORD.

64. The same day the king hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of LORD, for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before

65. So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.

66. On the eighth day he sent the people away. And they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that LORD had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people.

## 1 Kings 9

1. And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,

2. that LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.

3. And LORD said to him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, which thou have made before me. I have hallowed this house, which thou have built, to put my name there forever. And my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetuall

4. And as for thee, if thou will walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances,

5. then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

6. But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your sons, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them,

7. then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them. And this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight. And Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

8. And though this house is so high, yet shall every man who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss. And they shall say, Why has LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?

9. and they shall answer, Because they forsook LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore has LORD brought all this evil upon

10. And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of LORD and the king's house

11. (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that king Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

12. And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him. And they did not please him.

13. And he said, What cities are these which thou have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.

14. And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.

15. And this is the reason for the conscription which king Solomon raised to build the house of LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

16. Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.

17. And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,

18. and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,

19. and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion

20. As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,

21. their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon raised a conscription of bondservants to this day.

22. But of the sons of Israel Solomon made no bondservants, but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his rulers, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.

23. These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that labored in the work.

24. But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which [Solomon] had built for her. Then he built Millo.

25. And three times a year Solomon offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built to LORD, burning incense therewith, [upon the altar] that was before LORD. So he finished the house.

26. And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.

27. And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

28. And they came to Ophir, and fetched gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

## 1 Kings 10

1. And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.

2. And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she conversed with him of all that was in her heart.

3. And Solomon answered to her all her questions; there was not anything hid from the king which he did not answer.

4. And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,

5. and the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of LORD, there was no more spirit in her.

6. And she said to the king, It was a TRUE report that I heard in my own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.

7. However I did not believe the words until I came, and my eyes had seen it. And, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.

8. Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom.

9. Blessed be LORD thy God, who delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of Israel. Because LORD loved Israel forever, therefore he made thee king, to do justice and righteousness.

10. And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great store, and precious stones. There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

11. And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.

12. And the king made pillars of the almug trees for the house of LORD, and for the king's house, also harps and psalteries for the singers. There have come no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day.

13. And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.

14. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,

15. besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.

16. And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.

17. And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

18. Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.

19. There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind. And there were supports on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the supports.

20. And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.

21. And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; it was accounted of nothing in the days of Solomon.

22. For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram. Once every three years the navy of Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

23. So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.

24. And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.

25. And every man brought his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.

26. And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. And he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

27. And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.

28. And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. And the king's merchants received them in herds, each herd at a price.

29. And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.

## 1 Kings 11

1. Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites,

2. of the nations concerning which LORD said to the sons of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods. Solomon clave to these in love.

3. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.

4. For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with LORD his God as was the heart of David his father.

5. For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

6. And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and went not fully after LORD as did David his father.

7. Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab on the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the sons of Ammon.

8. And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.

9. And LORD was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away from LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,

10. and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep that which LORD commanded.

11. Therefore LORD said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

12. Notwithstanding I will not do it in thy days, for David thy father's sake, but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

13. However I will not rend away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.

14. And LORD raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the king's seed in Edom.

15. For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom

16. (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months until he had cut off every male in Edom),

17. that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.

18. And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran. And they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him provisions, and gave him land.

19. And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.

20. And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.

21. And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart that I may go to my own country.

22. Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seek to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing, however only let me depart.

23. And God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.

24. And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop when David killed them [of Zobah]. And they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.

25. And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]. And he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.

26. And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.

27. And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.

28. And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. And Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.

29. And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way. Now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment, and the two were alone in the field.

30. And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.

31. And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces, for thus says LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee

32. (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),

33. because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon. And they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my

34. However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes.

35. But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to thee, even ten tribes.

36. And I will give one tribe to his son, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me to put my name there.

37. And I will take thee, and thou shall reign according to all that thy soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.

38. And it shall be, if thou will hearken to all that I command thee, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did. That I will be with thee, and will

39. And for this I will afflict the seed of David, but not forever.

40. Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.

41. Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?

42. And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.

43. And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

## 1 Kings 12

1. And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel came to Shechem to make him king.

2. And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,

3. and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,

4. Thy father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore make thou lighter the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

5. And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.

6. And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye to me to return an answer to this people?

7. And they spoke to him, saying, If thou will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants forever.

8. But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that grew up with him, who stood before him.

9. And he said to them, What counsel give ye, that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father put upon us lighter?

10. And the young men that grew up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall thou say to this people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us; thus shall thou speak to them, My little f

11. And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

12. So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.

13. And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,

14. and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

15. So the king did not hearken to the people, for it was a thing brought about by LORD, that he might establish his word, which LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

16. And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own hous

17. But as for the sons of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

18. Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the men subject to task work. And all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

19. So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.

20. And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David, but only the tribe of Jud

21. And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to R

22. But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

23. Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,

24. Thus says LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the sons of Israel. Return every man to his house, for this thing is of me. So they hearkened to the word of LORD, and returned and went their way according to the

25. Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein. And he went out from there, and built Penuel.

26. And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.

27. If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah. And they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.

28. Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. And he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

29. And he set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.

30. And this thing became a sin, for the people went [to worship] before the one, even to Dan.

31. And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi.

32. And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And he placed in B

33. And he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the sons of Israel, and went up to the altar to

## 1 Kings 13

1. And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of LORD to Bethel. And Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.

2. And he cried against the altar by the word of LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus says LORD: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name. And upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that b

3. And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which LORD has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.

4. And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against h

5. The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of LORD.

6. And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the favor of LORD thy God, and pray for me that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God entreated LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him again, an

7. And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

8. And the man of God said to the king, If thou will give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;

9. for so it was charged me by the word of LORD, saying, Thou shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou came.

10. So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.

11. Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel. And one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. The words which he had spoken to the king, they also told them to their father.

12. And their father said to them, What way did he go? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, who came from Judah.

13. And he said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled him the donkey, and he rode on it.

14. And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, Are thou the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am.

15. Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

16. And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee. Neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place;

17. for it was said to me by the word of LORD, Thou shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou came.

18. And he said to him, I also am a prophet as thou are. And a [heavenly] agent spoke to me by the word of LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied to him.

19. So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.

20. And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of LORD came to the prophet who brought him back.

21. And he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says LORD, Forasmuch as thou have been disobedient to the mouth of LORD, and have not kept the commandment which LORD thy God commanded thee,

22. but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water, thy body shall not come to the sepulcher of thy fathers.

23. And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, [namely], for the prophet whom he had brought back.

24. And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him. And his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body.

25. And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.

26. And when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God who was disobedient to the mouth of LORD. Therefore LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according

27. And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me. And they saddled it.

28. And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey.

29. And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the donkey, and brought it back. And he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.

30. And he laid his body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, [saying], Alas, my brother!

31. And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.

32. For the saying which he cried by the word of LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.

33. After this thing Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again made from among all the people priests of the high places. Whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.

34. And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

## 1 Kings 14

1. At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

2. And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself that thou not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam, and get thee to Shiloh. Behold, there is Ahijah the prophet who spoke concerning me that I should be king ov

3. And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him. He will tell thee what shall become of the child.

4. And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set because of his age.

5. And LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of thee concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus thou shall say to her, for it will be, when she comes in, that she will feign herself to be another wo

6. And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam. Why feign thou thyself to be another? For I am sent to thee with heavy news.

7. Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says LORD, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,

8. and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee, and yet thou have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart to do only that which was right in my eyes,

9. but have done evil above all who were before thee, and have gone and made thee other gods, and molten images to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind thy back,

10. therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam as a man sw

11. He who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat, and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat, for LORD has spoken it.

12. Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house. When thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.

13. And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him, for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.

14. Moreover LORD will raise up a king for him over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. But what? Even now.

15. For LORD will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. And he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River because they have made their Asherim, provoking LO

16. And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.

17. And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.

18. And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.

19. And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

20. And the days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his fathers. And Nadab his son reigned in his stead.

21. And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name

22. And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.

23. For they also built for them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree.

24. And there were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which LORD drove out before the sons of Israel.

25. And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.

26. And he took away the treasures of the house of LORD, and the treasures of the king's house. He even took away all. And he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

27. And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the king's house.

28. And it was so, that, as often as the king went into the house of LORD, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.

29. Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

30. And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

31. And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

## 1 Kings 15

1. Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijah began to reign over Judah.

2. He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom [Absalom].

3. And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him. And his heart was not perfect with LORD his God as the heart of David his father.

4. Nevertheless for David's sake LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem,

5. because David did that which was right in the eyes of LORD, and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.

6. Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.

7. And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

8. And Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead.

9. And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah.

10. And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. And his grandmother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom [Absalom].

11. And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of LORD as David his father did.

12. And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.

13. And also he removed Maacah his grandmother from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. And Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.

14. But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with LORD all his days.

15. And he brought into the house of LORD the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

16. And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.

17. And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

18. Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son o

19. [There is] a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent to thee a present of silver and gold. Go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

20. And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.

21. And it came to pass, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

22. Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted. And they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built. And king Asa built with it Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

23. Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in

24. And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.

25. And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah. And he reigned over Israel two years.

26. And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.

27. And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.

28. Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.

29. And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam. He left to Jeroboam not any who breathed, until he had destroyed him according to the saying of LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Sh

30. for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.

31. Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

32. And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.

33. In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, [and reigned] twenty-four years.

34. And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.

## 1 Kings 16

1. And the word of LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,

2. Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins,

3. , behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

4. He of Baasha who dies in the city shall the dogs eat, and he of his who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.

5. Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

6. And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

7. And moreover the word of LORD came against Baasha by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of LORD, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands in be

8. In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, [and reigned] two years.

9. And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah.

10. And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.

11. And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha. He left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.

12. Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha according to the word of LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,

13. for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.

14. Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

15. In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

16. And the people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also smitten the king. Therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.

17. And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.

18. And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire,

19. and died for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did to make Israel to sin.

20. Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

21. Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.

22. But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri reigned.

23. In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, [and reigned] twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah.

24. And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver. And he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.

25. And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him.

26. For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.

27. Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

28. So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

29. And in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. And Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.

30. And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of LORD above all who were before him.

31. And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him

32. And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.

33. And Ahab made the Asherah. And Ahab did yet more to provoke LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.

34. In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho. He laid the foundation of it with the loss of Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates of it with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of LORD, which he spok

## 1 Kings 17

1. And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said to Ahab, As LORD, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.

2. And the word of LORD came to him, saying,

3. Get thee from here, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith that is before the Jordan.

4. And it shall be, that thou shall drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

5. So he went and did according to the word of LORD, for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is before the Jordan.

6. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank of the brook.

7. And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.

8. And the word of LORD came to him, saying,

9. Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.

10. So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel that I may drink.

11. And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.

12. And she said, As LORD thy God lives, I do not have a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse. And, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it,

13. And Elijah said to her, Fear not, go and do as thou have said. But make me of it a little cake first, and bring it forth to me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.

14. For thus says LORD, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not be used up, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that LORD sends rain upon the earth.

15. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. And she, and he, and her house, ate [many] days.

16. The jar of meal was not used up, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.

17. And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick, and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.

18. And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? Thou have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son!

19. And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.

20. And he cried to LORD, and said, O LORD my God, have thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son?

21. And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.

22. And LORD hearkened to the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.

23. And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, See, thy son lives.

24. And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou are a man of God, and that the word of LORD in thy mouth is truth.

## 1 Kings 18

1. And it came to pass after many days, that the word of LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth.

2. And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And the famine was severe in Samaria.

3. And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared LORD greatly;

4. for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

5. And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the fountains of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the beasts.

6. So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

7. And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him. And he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?

8. And he answered him, It is I. Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].

9. And he said, How have I sinned that thou would deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me?

10. As LORD thy God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek thee. And when they said, He is not here, he took an oath from the kingdom and nation that they did not find thee.

11. And now thou say, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].

12. And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of LORD will carry thee where I know not. And so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will kill me. But I thy servant fear LORD from my you

13. Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of LORD, how I hid a hundred men of LORD's prophets by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?

14. And now thou say, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here], and he will kill me.

15. And Elijah said, As LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.

16. So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

17. And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?

18. And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of LORD, and thou have followed the Baalim.

19. Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.

20. So Ahab sent to all the sons of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to mount Carmel.

21. And Elijah came near to all the people, and said, How long do ye go limping between the two sides? If LORD be God, follow him, but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.

22. Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of LORD, but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.

23. Let them therefore give us two bullocks, and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under. And I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fi

24. And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of LORD. And the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.

25. And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first, for ye are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.

26. And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the alt

27. And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is meditating, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.

28. And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.

29. And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the [evening] oblation, but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

30. And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of LORD that was thrown down.

31. And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.

32. And with the stones he built an altar in the name of LORD. And he made a trench around the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.

33. And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.

34. And he said, Do it the second time, and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time, and they did it the third time.

35. And the water ran round about the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.

36. And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the [evening] oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O LORD, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou are God in Israel, and

37. Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou, LORD, are God, and [that] thou have turned their heart back again.

38. Then the fire of LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.

39. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. And they said, LORD, he is God, LORD, he is God.

40. and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them, and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.

41. And Elijah said to Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of abundance of rain.

42. So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.

43. And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.

44. And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, a cloud rises out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Make ready [thy chariot], and get thee down, that the rain not stop thee.

45. And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

46. And the hand of LORD was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

## 1 Kings 19

1. And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and also how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

2. Then Jezebel send a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.

3. And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life. And he came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.

4. But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree. And he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough, now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my

5. And he lay down and slept under a juniper tree, and, behold, a [heavenly] agent touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.

6. And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he ate and drank, and laid him down again.

7. And the agent of LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee.

8. And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.

9. And he came to a cave there, and lodged there. And, behold, the word of LORD came to him, and he said to him, What are thou doing here, Elijah?

10. And he said, I have been very jealous for LORD, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my lif

11. And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before LORD. And, behold, LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before LORD, but LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind a

12. And after the earthquake a fire, but LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire a still small voice.

13. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What are thou doing here, Elijah?

14. And he said, I have been very jealous for LORD, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my lif

15. And LORD said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when thou come, thou shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.

16. And thou shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel. And thou shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah to be prophet in thy place.

17. And it shall come to pass, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill. And he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.

18. Yet I have reserved [for me] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.

19. So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke [of oxen] before him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle upon him.

20. And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again, for what have I done to thee?

21. And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to

## 1 Kings 20

1. And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together. And there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.

2. And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, Thus says Ben-hadad,

3. Thy silver and thy gold is mine, thy wives also and thy sons, even the best, are mine.

4. And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king, I am thine, and all that I have.

5. And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben-hadad, saying, I indeed sent to thee, saying, Thou shall deliver to me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy sons.

6. But I will send my servants to thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it a

7. Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeks mischief, for he sent to me for my wives, and for my sons, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I did not deny him

8. And all the elders and all the people said to him, Do thou not hearken, nor consent.

9. Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou sent for to thy servant at the first I will do, but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.

10. And Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.

11. And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him who girds on [his armor] boast himself as he who puts it off.

12. And it came to pass, when [Ben-hadad] heard this message as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set [yourselves in array]. And they set [themselves in array] against the city.

13. And, behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus says LORD, Have thou seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day, and thou shall know that I am LORD.

14. And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says LORD, By the young men of the rulers of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.

15. Then he mustered the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two. And after them he mustered all the people, even all the sons of Israel, being seven thousand.

16. And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him.

17. And the young men of the rulers of the provinces went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.

18. And he said, Whether they come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they come out for war, taken them alive.

19. So these went out of the city, the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and the army which followed them.

20. And they killed everyone his man. And the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. And Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.

21. And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.

22. And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself. And mark, and see what thou do, for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.

23. And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is a god of the hills, therefore they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.

24. And do this thing: Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place.

25. And number thee an army, like the army that thou have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. And we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened to their voice, and did

26. And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.

27. And the sons of Israel were mustered, and were supported, and went against them. And the sons of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids, but the Syrians filled the country.

28. And a man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus says LORD, Because the Syrians have said, LORD is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys, therefore I will deliver all this great multitude

29. And they encamped one opposite the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined. And the sons of Israel killed of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.

30. But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city, and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.

31. And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps

32. So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad says, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? He is my brother.

33. Now the men observed diligently whether anything would come from him. And they quickly caught it, and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him, and he caused him to come up

34. And [Ben-hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore, and thou shall make streets for thee in Damascus as my father made in Samaria. And I, [said Ahab], will let thee go with this covenant. So

35. And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said by the word of LORD to his fellow, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.

36. Then said he to him, Because thou have not obeyed the voice of LORD, behold, as soon as thou are departed from me, a lion shall kill thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him.

37. Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.

38. So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.

39. And as the king passed by, he cried out to the king, and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle, and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man. If by any means he is missing,

40. And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So shall thy judgment be, thyself have decided it.

41. And he hastened, and took the headband away from his eyes, and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

42. And he said to him, Thus says LORD, Because thou have let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.

43. And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

## 1 Kings 21

1. And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, near by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

2. And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near to my house. And I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it, or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee th

3. And Naboth said to Ahab, LORD forbid it of me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee.

4. And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him, for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and tu

5. But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad that thou eat no bread?

6. And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money, or else, if it please thee, I will give thee [another] vineyard for it. And he answered, I will not give thee my vineyar

7. And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry. I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

8. So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, [and] who dwelt with Naboth.

9. And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.

10. And set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou cursed God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.

11. And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.

12. They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.

13. And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him. And the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth cursed God and the king. Then they carried him forth o

14. Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.

15. And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money, for Naboth is not al

16. And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.

17. And the word of LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

18. Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it.

19. And thou shall speak to him, saying, Thus says LORD, Have thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shall speak to him, saying, Thus says LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, eve

20. And Ahab said to Elijah, Have thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee because thou have sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of LORD.

21. Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel.

22. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which thou have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.

23. And LORD spoke also of Jezebel, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.

24. He who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat, and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.

25. (But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.

26. And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did whom LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.)

27. And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

28. And the word of LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

29. See thou how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

## 1 Kings 22

1. And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.

2. And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

3. And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?

4. And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou are, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.

5. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of LORD.

6. Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for LORD will deliver it into the hand of the k

7. But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?

8. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the kin

9. Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.

10. Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them.

11. And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for him horns of iron, and said, Thus says LORD, With these thou shall push the Syrians until they be consumed.

12. And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper, for LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.

13. And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth. Let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.

14. And Micaiah said, As LORD lives, what LORD says to me, that I will speak.

15. And when he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper, and LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.

16. And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of LORD?

17. And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And LORD said, These have no master, let them return every man to his house in peace.

18. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?

19. And [Micaiah] said, Therefore hear thou the word of LORD. I saw LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.

20. And LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.

21. And there came forth a spirit, and stood before LORD, and said, I will entice him.

22. And LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shall entice him, and shall also prevail. Go forth, and do so.

23. Now therefore, behold, LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and LORD has spoken evil concerning thee.

24. Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of LORD go from me to speak to thee?

25. And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shall see on that day when thou shall go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

26. And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son,

27. and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I come in peace.

28. And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.

29. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

30. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.

31. Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.

32. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel, and they turned aside to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out.

33. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.

34. And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, for I am severely wounded.

35. And the battle increased that day. And the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians. And he died at evening, and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.

36. And there went a cry throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.

37. So the king died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.

38. And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves [there]), according to the word of LORD which he spoke.

39. Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

40. So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.

41. And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

42. Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

43. And he walked in all the way of Asa his father. He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of LORD. However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high pla

44. And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

45. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

46. And he put away out of the land the remnant of the sodomites, who remained in the days of his father Asa.

47. And there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.

48. Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.

49. Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.

50. And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

51. Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.

52. And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, how he made Israel to sin.

53. And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger LORD, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
