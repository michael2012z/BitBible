## Song of Songs 1

1. The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.

2. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine.

3. Thine oils have a good fragrance. Thy name is oil poured forth. Therefore the virgins love thee.

4. Draw me, we will run after thee. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will be glad and rejoice in thee. We will make mention of thy love more than of wine. Rightly do they love thee.

5. I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

6. Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, because the sun has scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me. They made me keeper of the vineyards, [but] my own vineyard I have not kept.

7. Tell me, O thou whom my soul loves, where thou feed [thy flock], where thou make [it] to rest at noon. For why should I be as she who is veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?

8. If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

9. I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.

10. Thy cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair], thy neck with strings of jewels.

11. We will make thee plaits of gold with studs of silver.

12. While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance.

13. My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh that lays between my breasts.

14. My beloved is to me a cluster of henna-flowers in the vineyards of En-gedi.

15. Behold, thou are fair, my love, behold thou are fair. Thine eyes are doves.

16. Behold, thou are fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant. Also our couch is green.

17. The beams of our house are cedars, our rafters are firs.

## Song of Songs 2

1. I am a rose of Sharon. A lily of the valleys.

2. As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.

3. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

4. He brought me to the banquet house, and his banner over me was love.

5. Sustain ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am sick from love.

6. His left hand [is] under my head, and his right hand embraces me.

7. I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.

8. The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.

9. My beloved is like a roe or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind our wall. He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice.

10. My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

11. For, lo, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone.

12. The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.

13. The fig tree ripens her green figs, and the vines are in blossom. They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

14. O my dove, who are in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place, let me see thy countenance; let me hear thy voice. For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.

15. Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards. For our vineyards are in blossom.

16. My beloved is mine, and I am his. He feeds among the lilies.

17. Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

## Song of Songs 3

1. By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.

2. [I said], I will rise now, and go around the city. In the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.

3. The watchmen who go about the city found me. [I said], Did ye see him whom my soul loves?

4. It was but a little that I passed from them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me.

5. I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.

6. Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?

10. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the seat thereof of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem.

4. Thy neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which there hang a thousand bucklers, all the shields of the mighty men.

5. Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe, which feed among the lilies.

6. Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

7. Thou are all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee.

8. Come with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

9. Thou have ravished my heart, my sister, [my] bride. Thou have ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

10. How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is thy love than wine, and the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!

2. I was asleep, but my heart awoke. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled. For my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.

3. I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?

4. My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door], and my heart was moved for him.

5. I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands drops with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.

## Song of Songs 7

1. How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilful workman.

3. Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe.

4. Thy neck is like the tower of ivory. Thine eyes, the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.

5. Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple. The king is held captive in the tresses.

6. How fair and how pleasant thou are, O love, for delights!

7. This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to its clusters.

8. I said, I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of the branches of it. Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples,

9. and thy mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips and teeth.

10. I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

11. Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field. Let us lodge in the villages.

4. I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake love, until it please.

6. Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm. For love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as Sheol. The flashes of it are flashes of fire, a most vehement flame.

7. Many waters cannot quench love, nor can floods drown it. If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned.

8. We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

9. If she is a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver. And if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
