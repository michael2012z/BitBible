# 1 John

## 1 John 1

1. What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we looked upon, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life

2. (and the life was made known, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father, and was made known to us),

3. what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that ye also may have fellowship with us. Even also our fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

4. And we write these things to you, so that our joy may be made full.

5. And this is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

6. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.

7. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from every sin.

8. If we say that we have no sin, we lead ourselves astray, and the truth is not in us.

9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so that he will forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from every unrighteousness.

10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

## 1 John 2

1. My little children, I write these things to you so that ye may not sin. And if any man does sin, we have an advocate with the Father--righteous Jesus Christ.

2. And he is the atonement for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.

3. And by this we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.

4. He who says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in this man.

5. But whoever keeps his word, truly in this man the love of God is fully perfected. By this we know that we are in him.

6. He who claims to abide in him he also ought so to walk just as that man walked.

7. Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment that ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that ye heard from the beginning.

8. Again, a new commandment I write to you, which is TRUE in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the TRUE light now shines.

9. He who claims to be in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now.

10. He who loves his brother abides in the light, and no cause of stumbling is in him.

11. But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and he goes about in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

12. I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you through his name.

13. I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome evil. I write to you, children, because ye know the Father.

14. I wrote to you, fathers, because ye have know him from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome evil.

15. Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

16. Because everything in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the arrogance of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.

17. And the world passes away, and the lust of it, but he who does the will of God abides into the age.

18. Children, it is the last hour. And as ye heard that the antichrist comes, and now many antichrists have developed, from which we know that it is the last hour.

19. They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they were of us, they would have continued with us, but--so that they might be made known, that they are not all of us.

20. And ye have an anointing from the Holy, and ye know all the things.

21. I wrote to you not because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth.

22. Who is the liar if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.

23. Every man who denies the Son, also does not have the Father.

24. Therefore ye, let what ye heard from the beginning abide in you. If what ye heard from the beginning abides in you, ye also will abide in the Son and in the Father.

25. And this is the promise that he promised us: the eternal life.

26. I wrote these things to you concerning those who lead you astray.

27. And for you, the anointing that ye received from him abides in you, and ye have no need that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teaches you about all things, and is TRUE and is no lie, and just as it taught you, ye will a

28. And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he is made known, we may have confidence, and not be shamed by him at his coming.

29. If ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every man doing righteousness has been begotten of him.

## 1 John 3

1. Behold what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we may be called children of God. Because of this the world does not know you, because it did not know him.

2. Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet made known what we will be. But we know that whenever he is made known we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.

3. And every man who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that man is pure.

4. Every man doing sin also does lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.

5. And ye know that that man was made known so that he might take up our sins. And in him is no sin.

6. Every man abiding in him does not sin. Every man who is sinning has not seen him, nor has known him.

7. Little children, let no man lead you astray. He who is doing righteousness is righteous, just as that man is righteous.

8. He who is doing sin is of the devil, because the devil sinned from the beginning. The Son of God was made known for this, so that he might destroy the works of the devil.

9. Every man who has been begotten of God is not doing sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.

10. By this the children of God are visible, and the children of the devil. Every man not doing righteousness is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother.

11. Because this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love each other.

12. Not as Cain. He was of the wicked, and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were wrong, and his brother's right.

13. Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hates you.

14. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who is not loving the brother abides in death.

15. Every man hating his brother is a man-killer. And ye know that no man-killer has eternal life abiding in him.

16. By this we know love, because that man laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.

17. But whoever has the world's living, and sees his brother having need, and closes his bowels from him, how does the love of God abide in him?

18. My Little children, we should not love in word, nor with the tongue, but in deed and in truth.

19. And by this we know that we are of the truth, and will assure our hearts before him.

20. Because if our heart should condemn us, that God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.

21. Beloved, if our heart should not condemn us, we have confidence toward God,

22. and whatever we may ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do things pleasing in his sight.

23. And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love each other, just as he gave command.

24. And he who keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, from the Spirit that he gave us.

## 1 John 4

1. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but examine the spirits, whether they are of God, because many FALSE prophets have gone out into the world.

2. By this ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ having come in flesh is of God,

3. and every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ has come in flesh is not of God. And this is that of the antichrist, which ye have heard that it comes, and is now in the world already.

4. Ye are of God, little children, and ye have overcome them, because greater is he in you than he in the world.

5. They are of the world. Because of this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.

6. We are of God. He who knows God hears us. He who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

7. Beloved, we should love each other. Because love is of God, and every man who loves has been begotten of God, and knows God.

8. He who does not love does not know God, because God is love.

9. By this the love of God was made known in us, because God sent his Son, the only begotten, into the world so that we might live through him.

10. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son, an atonement for our sins.

11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also are obligated to love each other.

12. No man has ever seen God. If we love each other, God abides in us, and his love is in us, having been fully perfected.

13. In this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us from his Spirit.

14. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son, a Savior of the world.

15. Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.

16. And we know, and have believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.

17. By this love has been fully perfected with us, so that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because just as that man is, we also are in this world.

18. Fear is not in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear holds punishment, and he who is afraid has not been fully perfected in love.

19. We love him, because he first loved us.

20. If any man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?

21. And we have this commandment from him, so that he who loves God will also love his brother.

## 1 John 5

1. Every man who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten from God, and every man who loves him who begot, also loves him who has been begotten from him.

2. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.

3. For this is the love of God, that we may keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.

4. Because everything that has been begotten from God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.

5. And who is he who overcomes the world, if not he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

6. This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And it is the Spirit that testifies, because the Spirit is truth.

7. Because those who testify are three:

8. the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. And the three are in one.

9. If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. Because this is the testimony of God that he has testified about his Son.

10. He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified about his Son.

11. And this is the testimony, that God gave eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son.

12. He who has the Son has the life. He who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.

13. I wrote these things to you, those who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.

14. And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.

15. And if we know that he hears us, whatever we may ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.

16. If any man may see his brother sinning a sin not toward death, he will ask, and he will give life to him, to those not sinning toward death. There is sin toward death. I do not say that he should make request about that.

17. All unrighteousness is sin. And there is sin not toward death.

18. We know that every man who has been begotten from God does not sin, but he who was begotten from God keeps himself, and the evil does not touch him.

19. We know that we are of God, and the whole world is set in the evil.

20. And we know that the Son of God comes, and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true. And we are in the true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the TRUE God, and the eternal life.

21. Little children, guard yourselves from the idols. Truly.
