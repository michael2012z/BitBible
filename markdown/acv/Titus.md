# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul, a bondman of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen of God, and the knowledge of truth according to piety,

2. in hope of eternal life, which the non-lying God promised before times eternal,

3. but in his own times he made known his word by preaching, which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,

4. to Titus, a genuine child according to the common faith: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.

5. I left thee behind in Crete on account of this: That thou should set in order the things lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded thee,

6. if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having believing children, not with an accusation of debauchery or insubordinate.

7. For the overseer must be blameless as a steward of God, not self-willed, not prone to angry, not a drunkard, not a fighter, not greedy of base gain,

8. but a lover of strangers, a lover of good, serious minded, just, devout, self-controlled,

9. holding firm the faithful word according to the teaching, so that he may also be able to exhort by the sound doctrine, and to correct those who contradict.

10. For there are also many insubordinate men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those from circumcision,

11. who must be muzzled, men who subvert whole houses, teaching things that they ought not, for sake of ugly profit.

12. A certain man of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.

13. This testimony is true, because of which reason, reprove them harshly, so that they may be sound in the faith,

14. not giving heed to Jewish myths, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

15. Truly to the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.

16. They profess to know God, but in their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and worthless for every good work.

## Titus 2

1. But speak thou the things that are fitting for the sound doctrine.

2. Aged men are to be without wine, noble, serious minded, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.

3. Aged women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good,

4. so that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

5. to be serious-minded, pure, homemakers, good, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed.

6. Likewise exhort the younger men to be sober-minded.

7. Concerning all things presenting thyself a pattern of good works in the doctrine: incorruption, dignity, incorruptibility,

8. sound speech, irreproachable, so that the man of opposition may be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.

9. Bondmen are to be obedient to their own masters, to be well-pleasing in all things, not speaking contrary,

10. not pilfering, but demonstrating all good fidelity, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.

11. For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men,

12. disciplining us, so that, having denied irreverence and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and piously in the present age.

13. Awaiting the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,

14. who gave himself for us, so that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a special people, a zealot of good works.

15. These things speak and exhort and rebuke with every command. Let no man disregard thee.

## Titus 3

1. Remind them to be submissive to principle offices and positions of authority, to be obedient, to be prepared for every good work,

2. to slander no man, to be noncontentious, meek, showing all mildness to all men.

3. For we also were formerly foolish, disobedient, being led astray, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in evil and envy, hateful, hating each other.

4. But when the kindness and philanthropy of God our Savior appeared,

5. he saved us, not of works in righteousness that we did, but according to his mercy through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,

6. which he poured out upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior.

7. So that, having been made righteous by the grace of that man, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

8. Faithful is the saying. And I want thee to strongly insist about these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to manage good works. These things are good and beneficial to men.

9. But avoid foolish questionings, and genealogies, and contentions, and legal fightings, for they are useless and vain.

10. Shun a factious man after a first and second admonition,

11. knowing that such a man is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.

12. When I will send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus. Be diligence to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to winter there.

13. Help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way diligently, so that nothing may be lacking for them.

14. And also let our men learn to be in the lead of good works for the essential needs, so that they may not be unfruitful.

15. All those with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in faith. Grace is with all of you. Truly.
