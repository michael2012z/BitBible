5. On the other side of Literally “in the beyond of” the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law,Hebrew torah ⌞saying⌟:Literally “to say”  

6.  Historical Prologue “Yahweh our God spoke to us at Horeb, ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say” ‘You have stayed ⌞long enough⌟Literally “much time” at this mountain.

7. Turn now and ⌞move on⌟,Literally “journey on with respect to yourselves” or “move yourselves out” and go into the hill of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” and to all of the neighboring regionsOr “peoples” in the Jordan ⌞Valley⌟Literally “Arabah,” arid stretches of land. in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, into the land of the CanaanitesHebrew “Canaanite” and into the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates.

8. Look, I have set the land ⌞before you⌟;Literally “before your face” go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors,Or “fathers” to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give it to them and to their offspring after them.’ 

9. “And I spoke to them at that time, ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say” ‘I am not able to bear you alone.

10. Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and look; you are today as the stars of the heaven ⌞in number⌟.Literally “with respect to multitude/abundance”

11. Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,Or “fathers” may he add to you as you are now a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he ⌞promised you⌟.Literally “spoke to you”

12. How can I bear you ⌞by myself⌟,Literally “to me alone” your burden and your load and your strife?

13. Choose for yourselves ⌞wise and discerning and knowledgeable men⌟Literally “men wise and discerning and knowledgeable” for each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’ 

14. “And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’

15. And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and then I appointed them as leaders over you as commanders of groups of thousands and commanders of groups of hundreds and commanders of groups of fifties and commanders of groups of tens as officials for your tribes.

16. And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘⌞hear out your fellow men⌟,Literally “hear between your brothers,” with the idea of listening carefully in this context and then judge fairlyOr “righteously” between a man and between his brother and between ⌞his opponent who is a resident alien⌟.Literally “between his resident alien/non-Israelite who dwells temporarily among Israel”

18. And so I instructed you at that time concerning all of the things that you should do. 

19. “Then we set out from Horeb, and we went through the whole of that great and terrible desert that you saw on the way to the hill country of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” as Yahweh our God had commanded us, and so we came up to Kadesh Barnea.

20. I said to you, ‘⌞You have reached⌟Literally “You have come up to” the hill country of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” that Yahweh our God is giving to us.

21. See, Yahweh your God has set before you the land; go up and possess it as Yahweh the God of your ancestorsOr “fathers” said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.’ 

22. “Then all of you approached me, and you said, ‘Let us send men ⌞before us⌟,Literally “before our faces” or “ahead of us” and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back ⌞a report⌟Literally “a word” to us concerning the way that ⌞we should take⌟Literally “we should go up by it” and concerning the cities that we shall come to.’

23. The plan was good ⌞in my opinion⌟,Literally “in my eyes” and so I took from among you twelve men, ⌞one from each tribe⌟.Literally “man one from the tribe”

24. And they ⌞set out⌟Literally “turned” and ⌞went up into the hill country⌟,Literally “went up toward the hill country mountain” and they went up to the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Eschol, and they spied out the land.

25. They took in their handsHebrew “hand” ⌞some of the fruit⌟Literally “from the fruit” of the land, and they brought it down to us, and they brought to us back ⌞a report⌟,Literally “a word” and they said, ‘The land that Yahweh our God is giving to us is good.’

26. But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the ⌞command⌟Literally “mouth” of Yahweh your God.

27. And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, ‘Because of the hatred of Yahweh toward us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” to destroy us.

28. Where can we go up? Our brothers have ⌞made our hearts melt⌟,Literally “caused to melt our hearts” ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say” “The people are greaterOr “bigger” and taller than we are,Hebrew “than us” and there are great fortified cities reaching up to heaven, and we saw the sons of the Anakites living there.” ’ 

29. “And so I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, and do not fear them.

30. Yahweh your God, who is going ⌞before you⌟,Literally “to your faces” will himselfThe Hebrew pronoun indicates emphasis fight for you, ⌞just as⌟Literally “like all that” he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,

31. and just as he did in the wildernessOr “desert” whenOr “where” you saw thatOr “how” Yahweh your God carried you, just as someoneOr “a man” carries his son, all along the way that you traveled until ⌞you reached⌟Literally “you came” this place.’

32. But through all of this you did not trust in Yahweh your God,

33. ⌞who goes⌟Literally “is the one going” ⌞before you⌟Literally “before your faces” on yourHebrew “the” way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that ⌞you should go⌟.Literally “you should go in it” 

34. “Then Yahweh heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say”

35. ‘No one of these menThe beginning of an oath in Hebrew; the text emphatically denies anyone of that evil generation the privilege of seeing the promised land of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,Or “fathers”

36. except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himselfEmphatic use of the pronoun shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sonsOr “descendants” because ⌞he followed Yahweh unreservedly⌟.’Literally “he filled his hands after Yahweh”

37. Even with me Yahweh was angry because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there.

38. Joshua, the son of Nun, ⌞your assistant⌟,Literally “the one standing before you” will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it.

39. And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselvesThe Hebrew pronoun is used for emphasis go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it.

40. But you turn and set out in the direction of the wilderness by way of the ⌞Red Sea⌟.’Literally “sea of reeds” 

41. “You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Yahweh, and now we will go up and fight according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us’; and so each man fastened on ⌞his battle gear⌟,Literally “his vessels of battle” and you regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country.

42. So Yahweh said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated ⌞before⌟Literally “in the faces of your enemies” your enemies.” ’

43. So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the ⌞command of Yahweh⌟;Literally “mouth of Yahweh” you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country.

44. The Amorites living in the hill country went out ⌞to oppose you⌟Literally “to meet you” and chased you as a swarm of wild honey bees do; and so they ⌞beat⌟Literally “cut” you down in Seir as far as Hormah.

45. So you returned and wept ⌞before Yahweh⌟;Literally “before the faces of Yahweh” but Yahweh did not listen to your voice and did not pay any attention to you.

46. You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed there.   

## Deuteronomy 2

1.  “Then we turned and set out toward the wildernessOr “desert” in the direction of the ⌞Red Sea⌟,Literally “sea of reeds” as Yahweh told me, and we went around Mount Seir for many days.

2. Yahweh spoke to me, ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say”

3. ‘Long enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north,

4. and instructOr “command” the people, ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say” “You are about to cross through the territory of your brothers, the descendantsOr “sons” of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and so be very careful.

5. Do not get involved in battleOr “provoke” with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even ⌞a foot’s breadth⌟Literally “a sole’s foot of space” of it; since I have given Mount Seir as a possession for Esau.

6. You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.

7. The fact of the matter is, Yahweh your God has blessed you in ⌞all the work you have done⌟;Literally “the work of your hand” he knows ⌞your travels⌟Literally “your journeying” with respect to this great wilderness; forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing.” ’

8. And so we passed by our brothers, the descendantsOr “sons” of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah,Or “Jordan Valley” since the Arabah is an extension of it from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desertOr “wilderness” of Moab. 

9. And Yahweh said to me, ‘You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in warOr “battle” with them, for I will not give you any of his land as a possession; I have given Ar to the descendantsOr “sons” of Lot as a possession.’

10. (The Emim previously lived in it, a people large,Or “great” in the sense of influential numerous, and tall, like the Anakites.

11. They were reckoned also as Rephaim as the Anakites were; but the Moabites called them Emim.

12. The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendantsOr “sons” of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them ⌞from among themselves⌟,Literally “from their presence” as Israel did with respect to the land of theirLiterally “its/his” possession that Yahweh gave to them.)

13. So now arise and cross over the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Zered yourselves; and so we crossed the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Zered.

14. Now the ⌞length of time⌟Literally “days” that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until the time when we crossed the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Zered was thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; that is, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Yahweh had sworn to them.

15. The hand of Yahweh was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely. 

16. “⌞And then⌟Literally “And it happened” when all the men of warOr “battle” ⌞had died⌟Literally “had finished/completed to die” from among the people,

17. Yahweh spoke to me, ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say”

18. ‘You are about to cross over the boundary of Moab ⌞today⌟Literally “the day” at Ar.

19. When you approach ⌞the border of⌟Literally “opposite” the ⌞Ammonites⌟,Literally “the sons/children of Ammon” you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of ⌞the Ammonites⌟Literally “the sons/children of Ammon” to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendantsOr “sons” of Lot as a possession.

20. (It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it ⌞previously⌟,Literally “before” and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,

21. a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Yahweh destroyed them from before them,That is, the Ammonites and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them,

22. just as he did for the descendantsOr “sons” of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from ⌞before them⌟Literally “from the face/presence of them” and dispossessed them, and then they settled in theirHebrew “them” place up to this day.

23. And also the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and then settled in their place.

24. Arise,Or “Get up” set out and cross over the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of it, and engage with him in battle.

25. This day I will begin to place ⌞the dread of you⌟Literally “your dread” and the fear of you ⌞before⌟Literally “upon the faces of” the peoples under all the heavens. They will hear ⌞the report about you⌟,Literally “your report” and so they will shake and tremble ⌞because of you⌟.’ Literally “from before you” 

26. “So I sent messengers from the wildernessOr “desert” of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; I sent terms of peace, ⌞saying⌟,Literally “to say”

27. ‘Let me cross through your land and ⌞only along the road⌟Literally “in the road, in the road” I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.

28. Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot.

29. Just as the descendantsOr “the children/sons of” of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.’

30. But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his territory because Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and ⌞made him obstinate⌟Literally “made firm his heart” ⌞in order to give him⌟Literally “to give him,” indicating purpose into your hand, ⌞just as he has now done⌟.Literally “as it is this day”

31. Yahweh said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give ⌞over to you⌟Literally “to the face of you” Sihon and his land; begin ⌞to take possession of his land⌟.’Literally, “take possession in order to possess his land”

32. Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz.

33. And so Yahweh our God gave him over ⌞to us⌟,Literally “before us” and we struck him down, and his sonsOr “descendants” and all of his people.

34. So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town of males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor.

35. We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves,Hebrew “us” and also the booty of the cities that we had captured.

36. From Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Arnon and the city that was in the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season on up to Gilead, there was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Yahweh our God gave ⌞everything⌟Literally “the whole” ⌞to us⌟.Literally “before us”

37. Only the land of ⌞the Ammonites⌟Literally “children/sons of Ammon” you did not approach, all along the whole upper region of the Jabbok ⌞River⌟Literally “wadi,” which here refers to a flowing river and the towns of the hill country, according to all that Yahweh our God had instructed.   

## Deuteronomy 3

1.  “Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all of his army for the battle at Edrei.

2. And Yahweh said to me, ‘You should not fear him, for I have given him and all of his armyOr “people” and his land into your hand. And so you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” who was reigning in Heshbon.’

3. And so Yahweh our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his armyOr “people” into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained toOr “for” him.

4. And we captured all of his townsOr “villages/cities small” at that time; there was not a city that we did not take from them.

5. All of these were fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars,Hebrew “bar” ⌞apart from⌟Literally “alone from” very many of the villages of the open country.

6. And so we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; we destroyed utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children.

7. But all of the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.Hebrew “us” 

8. “And so we took at that time the land from ⌞the control of⌟Literally “the hand of” the two kings of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” who were ⌞on the other side of the Jordan⌟,Literally “in the beyond of the Jordan” from the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Arnon up to ⌞Mount Hermon⌟.Literally “the mountain of Hermon”

9. (The Sidonians called Hermon ‘Sirion,’ and the Amorites called it ‘Senir.’)

10. All of the towns of the plateau and the whole of Gilead and all of Bashan up to Salecah and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

11. (For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. Indeed, his bedstead—it was a bedstead of iron. It is in Rabbah of the ⌞Ammonites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Ammon” Nine cubits is its length, and four cubits is its width according to the cubit of a man.) 

12. And so we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Arnon, and also half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the ReubenitesHebrew “Reubenite” and to the Gadites.Hebrew “Gadite”

13. And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that area of Bashan was called the land of the Rephaim.

14. Jair the descendantOr “son” of Manasseh acquired the whole region of Argob, up to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called it,Hebrew “them” that is Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, ⌞as it still is today⌟.Literally “up to this day”

15. And also I gave Gilead to Makir.

16. And to the ReubenitesHebrew “Reubenite” and to the GaditesHebrew “Gadite” I gave, from Gilead up to the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season of Arnon, the middle of the wadiA valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season as a boundary and up to the Jabbok ⌞River⌟,Literally “wadi,” which here refers to a flowing river the boundary of the ⌞Ammonites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Ammon”

17. And the ⌞Jordan Valley⌟Literally “Arabah” with the Jordan River as its boundary, from KinnerethOr “Chinnereth,” the Sea of Galilee up to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,Or the Dead Sea with the slopes of Pisgah toward the east. 

18. “And I charged you all at that time when I said, “Yahweh has given you—to all of you—this land to possess. All the ⌞warriors⌟Literally “men of valor” shall cross over, ready to fight, before your brothers, the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

19. Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that ⌞you have much livestock⌟)Literally “livestock much there is to you” must stay in your towns that I have given you,

20. until Yahweh shall give rest to your brothers as he did to you, and also they take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each one to his possession that I have given to them.

21. And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes see all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings; so Yahweh will do to all of the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to.

22. You shall not fear them, for Yahweh your God is the one fighting for you. 

23. “And I pleaded with Yahweh at that time, saying,

24. ‘Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for whatHebrew “who” god is there in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds?

25. Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land ⌞that is beyond the Jordan⌟,Literally “in the beyond of the Jordan” this good hill country and Lebanon.’

26. But Yahweh was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Yahweh said, ‘⌞Enough of that from you⌟!Literally “Much to you” You shall not speak to me any longer about this matter!

27. Go up to the top of Pisgah and ⌞look around you⌟Literally “lift up your eyes” toward the west, toward the north, and toward the east, and ⌞view⌟Literally “look” the land with your eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.

28. Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himselfEmphatic use of the pronoun will cross over before this people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’

29. So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor.   

## Deuteronomy 4

1.  Introduction to the Stipulations “Now, Israel, listen to the rules and to the regulations that I am teaching you to do, in order that you may live and you may go in and you may take possession of the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,Or “fathers” is giving to you.

6. And ⌞you must observe them diligently⌟,Literally “you must observe and you must do” for that is your wisdom and your insight before the eyes of the people, who will hear all of these rules, and they will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people.’

12. And Yahweh spoke to you from the midst of the fire; ⌞you heard⌟Literally “you were hearing” a sound of words, but ⌞you did not see⌟Literally “you were not seeing” a form—only a voice.

13. And he declared to you his covenant, ⌞the Ten Commandments⌟,Literally “the ten words” which he charged you ⌞to observe⌟,Literally “to do” and he wrote them on the two tablets of stone.

15. “So ⌞you must be very careful for yourselves⌟,Literally “watch yourselves diligently with respect to your souls” because you did not seeOr “have not seen” any form on the day Yahweh spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,

22. For I am going to die in this land; I am not going to cross the Jordan, but you are going to cross, and you are going to take possession of this good land.

23. Watch out for yourselves so that you do not forget the covenant of Yahweh your God that he had ⌞made⌟Literally “cut” with you and make for yourselves a divine image of the form of anything that Yahweh your God ⌞has forbidden⌟,Literally “has commanded you about”

24. for Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealousOr “zealous” or “impassioned” God. 

25. “When you have had children and ⌞grandchildren⌟Literally “children of children” and you have grown old in the land and you act corruptly and you make a divine image of the form of anything and you do evil in the eyes of Yahweh your God, thus provoking him to anger,
