1.  Greeting Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in EphesusA number of the earliest and most important manuscripts omit “in Ephesus,” though it is hard to make sense of the line without this phrase (cf.

1.  Made Alive in Christ And you, ⌞although you were dead⌟Literally “and you being dead”Here the participle (“being”) is understood as concessive in your trespasses and sins,

2. in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience,

3. among whom also we all formerly lived in the desires of our flesh, doing the willOr “desires” of the flesh and of the mind, and we were children of wrathThis phrase is a Semitic idiom which can mean either (1) “children characterized by wrath” or (2) “children destined for wrath” by nature, as also the rest of them were.

7. of which I became a servant, according to the gift of God’s grace given to me, according to the working of his power. 

8. To me, the least of all the saints, was given this grace: to proclaim the good news of the fathomless riches of Christ to the Gentiles,

9. and to enlighten everyone as to what is the administration of the mystery hidden from the ages by God, who created all things,

10. in order that the many-sided wisdom of God might be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places through the church,

11. according to the purpose of the ages which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,

12. in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in him.Or “through his i.e., Christ’s faithfulness”

13. Therefore I ask youHere the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation not to be discouraged at my afflictions on behalf of you, which are your glory.

4. one body and one Spirit (just as also you were called with one hope of your calling),

5. one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

6. one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.

9. Now “he ascended,” what is it, except that he also descendedSome secondary manuscripts add “first” to the lower regions of the earth?

10. The one who descended himself is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, in order that he might fill all things. 

11. And he himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers

12. for the equipping of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ,

13. until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ,

14. so that we may no longer be infants, tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of people, by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit.

15. But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow into him with reference to all things, who is the head, Christ,

16. from whom the whole body, joined together and held together by every supporting ligament, according to the working by measure of each single part, the growth of the body makes for the building up of itself in love.  

17.  Appeal for New Behavior This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles walk: in the futility of their mind,

18. being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,

19. who, becoming callous, gave themselves over to licentiousness, for the pursuit of all uncleanness in greediness. 

20. But you did not learn Christ in this way,

21. if indeed you have heard about him, and you were taught by him (just as truth is in Jesus),

22. that you take off, according to your former way of life, the old man, who is being destroyed according to deceitful desires,

23. be renewed in the spirit of your mind,

24. and put on the new man (in accordance with God), who is created in righteousness and holiness from the truth.

27. nor give place to the devil.

29. ⌞No rotten word must proceed⌟Literally “Every rotten word must not proceed” from your mouth, but only something good for the building up of the need, in order that it may give grace to those who hear,

30. and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

31. All bitterness, and rage, and wrath, and clamor, and abusive speech, must be removed from you, together with all wickedness.

3. But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or greediness, must not even be named among you (as is fitting for saints),

4. and obscenity, and foolish talk, or coarse jesting (which are not proper), but rather thanksgiving.

9. (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),

10. trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord.

11. And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even expose them.

12. For it is shameful even to speak about the things being done by them in secret,

13. but all things exposed by the light are made visible,

14. for everything made visible is light. Therefore it says,  Wake up, sleeper, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.A quotation of unknown origin with possible allusions to Isa 26:19, 51:17, 52:1, 60:1  

15. Therefore, consider carefully how you live, not as unwise but as wise,

16. making the most of the time because the days are evil.

21. being subject to one another ⌞out of reverence for⌟Literally “in the fear of” Christ

22. —wives to their own husbands as to the Lord,

23. because the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church (he himself being the Savior of the body).

24. But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also wives should be subjectThe words “should be subject” are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous clause to their husbands in everything.  

25.  Husbands and Wives Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for her;

26. in order that he might sanctify her by cleansing herHere the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation with the washing of water by the word;

27. in order that he might present to himself the church glorious, not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she may be holy and blameless.

28. Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one who loves his own wife loves himself.

29. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ does the church,

30. because we are members of his body.

7. serving with goodwill as to the Lord and not to people,

8. because youHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“know”) which is understood as causal know that each one of you, whatever good he should do,Some manuscripts have “if he should do anything good” this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.

10.  Spiritual Warfare Finally, become strong in the Lord and in the might of his strength.

11. Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil,
