# Song of Songs

## Song of Songs 1

1.  Title  The Song of Songs,This construction conveys a superlative connotation, e.g., “The most exquisite song” which is forOr “by Solomon” or “about/concerning Solomon” Solomon.   

2.  Maiden’s Soliloquy  ⌞MayIn the maiden’s soliloquy, she thinks about her beloved in her thoughts (“May he kiss me!”), then poetically speaks to him as if he were in her presence (“for your love is better than wine”). To avoid confusion, the translation uses the second-person form throughout vv. 2–4 you kiss me⌟Literally “May he kiss me” ⌞passionately with your lips⌟,Literally “with the kisses of his mouth” for your love is better than wine.The shift from the third person “he … his” to the second person “you … your” in vv. 2–4 should not be interpreted as suggesting two different referents, that is, one male whom the maiden is addressing as “you,” and another to whom she refers as “he.” Rather, this shift is a poetic device (called “grammatical differentiation”) that is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (e.g., Gen 49:4; Deut 32:15; Psa 23:2–5; Isa 1:29; 42:20; 54:1; Jer 22:24; Amos 4:1; Mic 7:19; Lam 3:1; Song 4:2; 6:6). This shift is characteristic of a soliloquy, a dramatic or literary form in which a character reveals her thoughts without addressing a listener who is actually present (e.g., 2 Sam 19:4). In this case, the maiden’s private thoughts about her beloved (v. 2a) shift to an imaginary address to her beloved (vv. 2b–4a) 

3. As fragrance, ⌞your perfumes⌟Literally “your oil lotions” are ⌞delightful⌟;Literally “good” your name is poured out ⌞perfume⌟;Literally “oil lotion” therefore young women love you. 

4. Draw me after you, let us run! May the king bring me into his chambers!Or “The king has brought me into his chambers” Let us be joyful and let us rejoice in you; let us extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you!   

5.  Maiden’s Self-Description  I am black but beautiful,Or “black and beautiful” ⌞O maidens of Jerusalem⌟,Literally “O daughters of Jerusalem” like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 

6. Do not gaze at me because I am black, This is figurative for the maiden’s physical appearance; her skin was darkly tanned because the sun has stared at me. The sons of my mother were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own “vineyard”Literally “my vineyard that for me” I did not keep.   

7.  Dialogue between Shepherdess and Shepherd  Tell me, you whom my ⌞heart⌟Literally “soul” loves, where do you pasture your flock, where do your sheep lie down at the noon? ⌞For why should I be like⌟Literally “For to what will I be like” one who is veiledThe reading of the MT (“like one who is veiled”) is supported by the LXX. However, several ancient versions (Syriac Peshitta, Latin Vulgate, Symmachus) reflect an alternate Hebrew textual tradition in which two letters are transposed, resulting in the reading “like one who wanders about.” This makes good sense contextually, since the maiden does not know where her beloved would be at noon beside the flocks of your companions? 

8. If you do not know, O fairest among women, follow ⌞the tracks⌟Literally “in the tracks” of the flock, and pasture your little lambsOr “your kids” beside the tents of the shepherds.   

9.  Man’s Poetic Praise of His Beloved  To a mareOr “my mare” among the chariotsOr “chariot horses” of Pharaoh, I compare you, my beloved. 

10. Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. 

11. We will make ornaments of gold for you with studsOr “droplets” of silver.   

12.  Maiden’s Poetic Praise of Her Beloved  While the king was on his couch, my nard gave its fragrance. 

13. My beloved is to me ⌞a pouch⌟Literally “the bag” of myrrh, he spends the nightOr “he lays” between my breasts. 

14. My beloved is to me a cluster of blossoms of henna in the vineyards of En Gedi.   

15.  Mutual Admiration  Look! You are beautiful, my beloved. Look! You are beautiful; your eyes are doves. 

16. Look! You are beautiful, my beloved, truly pleasant. Truly our couch is ⌞verdant⌟;Literally “green” 

17. the beams of our house are cedar; our rafter is cypress.    

## Song of Songs 2

1.  Dialogue between Maiden and Her Beloved  I am a roseMore likely “meadow saffron” or “crocus.” Hebrew scholars and botanists suggest the term refers to Ashodelos (lily family), Narcissus tazetta (narcissus or daffodil), or Colchicum autumnale (meadow saffron or crocus) (e.g., Isa 35:1). The location of this flower in Sharon suggests a common wild flower rather than a rose. The maiden compares herself to a simple, common flower of the field of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 

2. Like a lily among the thorns,Or “brambles” so is my love among the maidens.

11. For look! The winter is over; ⌞the rainy season⌟Literally “the rain” ⌞has turned and gone away⌟.Literally “is over; it is gone” 

12. The blossoms ⌞appear⌟Literally “is seen” ⌞in the land⌟;Literally “on the earth” ⌞the time of singingMost likely, a subtle word play occurs here since there are two different words in Hebrew spelled the same way: “pruning” and “singing.” The former plays upon the first line and the latter upon the third line has arrived⌟;Literally “the time of the song arrived” the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 

13. The fig tree puts forth her figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give fragrance. ⌞Arise⌟,Literally “Arise, to you!” my beloved! ⌞Come, my beauty⌟!”Literally “My beauty, come, you”

## Song of Songs 3

He made its column of silver, its backOr “its support,” “its base,” “its headrest,” “its litter,” “its cover” of gold, its seat of purple; its interior is inlaid with leatherOr “love.” The Hebrew term here translated “leather” is spelled the same as the term for “love.” Most likely this is an example of a word play that puns on the intentional ambiguity: “Its interior was inlaid with leather//love by the maidens of Jerusalem” by ⌞the maidens of Jerusalem⌟.Literally “by the daughters of Jerusalem” 

11. Come out and look, ⌞O maidens of Zion⌟,Literally “O daughters of Zion” at ⌞King Solomon⌟,Literally “the king, Solomon” at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the joy of his heart!

6. I opened myself to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and gone;Or “my beloved had left; he was gone” my heart sankOr “my soul left” when he turned away.Or “when he was speaking.” Translations equivocate on how to translate this verb, since there are two terms in Hebrew spelled identically: “to speak” and “to turn aside” (HALOT 1:210). The context suggests the latter I sought him, but I did not find him; I called him, but he did not answer me.

8.  The Maiden’s Beauty Is without Peer  Sixty queens there are, eighty concubines, and maidens beyond number. 

9. My dove, ⌞she is the one⌟;Literally “she is one”The term “one” functions here as an adjective of quality: “unique, singular, the only one” my perfect, ⌞she is the only one⌟;Literally “she is one”Or “the only daughter of her mother.” Although the latter option is permissible, the term is used elsewhere of the heir as the favored child (e.g., Gen 22:2; Prov 4:3). This nuance is supported by the parallel term “favorite” she is ⌞the favorite of⌟Or “she is the pure one.” Since there are two Hebrew terms spelled the same way, some relate this to the adjective that means “pure.” Others relate it to the verb that means “to choose, select.” The parallelism favors the latterLiterally “the favorite for” her mother who bore her. Maidens see her and consider her fortunate;Or “call her happy” or “call her blessed” or “bless her” queens and concubines praise her: 

10. “Who is this that looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, ⌞bright as the sun⌟,Literally “pure as the glow”Or “bright as the heat of the sun.” The Hebrew term “glow” poetically refers to the bright rays of the sun (Psa 19:7; Isa 24:23; 30:26) ⌞overwhelming as an army with banners⌟?”Literally “terrible as the bannered ones”

13. Song of Songs 6:13–7:13 in the English Bible is 7:1–14 in the Hebrew Bible Turn, turn,Or “Return, return …!” O Shulammite!Or “O perfect one,” “O peaceful one,” “O bride.” Many interpreters take this moniker as suggesting the maiden was from the village of Shulem (alternately called Shunem) Turn, turnOr “Return, return …!” so that we may look upon you! Why do you look upon the Shulammite as at a dance of the two armies?    

## Song of Songs 7

1.  Solomon’s Praise of His Dancing Maiden  How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O royal princess!Or “O daughter of leader” The curves of your ⌞thighs⌟Literally “thigh” are like ⌞jewels⌟,Literally “ornaments” the work of the hands of a craftsman.

9. Your palate is like the best wine that goes down for my beloved, smoothly gliding over my lips and teeth.Or “over lips of sleepers.” One Hebrew textual tradition preserves the reading “lips of those who sleep” (MT). Another Hebrew tradition reads “my lips and my teeth,” as reflected by the ancient versions (LXX, Latin Vulgate, Aramaic Targum, Syriac Peshitta). The latter is adopted here since it makes the most sense poetically   

10.  Mutual Possession Refrain  ⌞I belong to my beloved⌟,Literally “I am for my beloved” ⌞and he desires me⌟!Literally “and his desire is for me.” Or “and his desire belongs to me”

## Song of Songs 8

1.  Maiden’s Fanciful Wish  ⌞How I wish that you were my little brother⌟,Literally “O that he would give you like a brother to me”The Hebrew construction (which is somewhat misleading if rendered in a woodenly literal sense) is an idiom expressing one’s fanciful wish who nursed ⌞upon my mother’s breasts⌟!Literally “at the breast of my mother” If ⌞I met you outside⌟,Literally “I will find you in the street” I would kiss you, ⌞and no one would despise me⌟!Literally “also they would not despise me” 

2. ⌞I would surely bring you⌟Literally “I would lead you and I would bring you”The combination of the two verbs creates a hendiadys which may be rendered more cogently as “I would surely bring you …” to the house of my mother, ⌞who would surely teach me⌟;Literally “she will teach me” ⌞I would give you spiced wine to drink⌟,Literally “I would give you to drink from the wine of the spice” the ⌞sweet wine⌟Or “juice” of my pomegranates.The traditional Hebrew reads the singular “my pomegranate.” However, the plural reading “my pomegranates” is attested in numerous medieval Hebrew manuscripts and is reflected in the ancient versions (Greek Septuagint, Aramaic Targum, Syriac Peshitta). The latter makes the most sense in this context as a euphemistic description of the maiden’s delights

4. I adjure you, ⌞O maidens of Jerusalem⌟,Literally “O daughters of Jerusalem” do notOr “Why must you … before it pleases?” arouse or awaken love until it pleases!Or “Do not stir up or awaken the love until it is willing,” or “Do not disturb or interrupt our lovemaking until it is satisfied”

6.  The Nature of Genuine Romantic Love  Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death; passion is fierce as Sheol; its flashes are flashes of fire; it is a blazing flame. 

7. Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away.Or “and rivers cannot engulf it” If a man were to give all the wealth of his house ⌞for love⌟,Literally “in the love” he would be utterly scorned.Literally “they will utterly scorn him”   

8.  Maiden’s Virtuous Chastity and Voluptuous Beauty  ⌞We have a little sister⌟,Literally “a little sister for us” ⌞and she does not yet have any breasts⌟.Literally “and there is no breast for her” What should we do for our sister ⌞on the day when she is betrothed⌟?Literally “on the day when it is spoken of her”Or “on the day when she is spoken for” 

9. If she is a wall, ⌞we will adorn her with a turret of silver⌟;Literally “we will build upon her a camp of silver”The term translated “turret” refers to the decorative parapet adorning the top of a building. This image is likely figurative for a silver tiara set upon the head but if she is a door, we will barricade her with boards of cedar.Or “we will enclose her” 

10. I was a wall, and my breasts were like the towers, ⌞so my betrothed viewed me with great delight⌟.Literally “then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace”
