2. Abraham became the father of Isaac, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers,

3. and Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez became the father of Hezron, and Hezron became the father of Aram,Although the Greek text reads “Aram,” many English versions substitute the Old Testament form of the name, “Ram” (cf. 1 Chr 2:9; Ruth 4:19), here and in the following verse

4. and Aram became the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,

5. and Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed became the father of Jesse,

6. and Jesse became the father of David the king. And David became the father of Solomon by the wifeThe word “wife” is not in the Greek text, but is implied idiomatically of Uriah,

10. and Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh became the father of Amon,The earliest and best Greek manuscripts read “Amos,” but many English versions use the Old Testament form of the name here, “Amon” (cf. 2 Kgs 21:18) and Amon became the father of Josiah,

11. and Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
