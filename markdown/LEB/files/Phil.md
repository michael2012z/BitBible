6. convinced of this same thing, that the one who began a good work in you will finish itHere the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation until the day of Christ Jesus,

7. just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, sinceHere “since” is supplied as a component of the participle (“are”) which is understood as causal both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you are sharers of grace with me.

11. having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.  

12.  The Progress of the Gospel Now I want you to know, brothers, that ⌞my circumstances⌟Literally “the things with me” have happened instead for the progress of the gospel,

13. so that my imprisonment in Christ has become known in the whole praetoriumOr “praetorian guard,” or “imperial guard” and to all the rest,

14. and most of the brothers, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, dare even more to speak the word without fear.

15. Some even because of envy and strife preach Christ, but some also because of good will.

20. according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will be put to shame in nothing, but with all boldness, even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death.

21. For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

22. But if it is to live in the flesh, this is fruitful work for me, and which I will prefer I do not know.

23. But I am hard pressed ⌞between the two options⌟Literally “by the two”, having the desire to depart and to be with Christ, ⌞for this is very much better⌟Literally “for this is more better by much”.

Stand Firm for the Gospel Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear ⌞your circumstances⌟Literally “the things concerning you”, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,

28. and not letting yourselves be intimidated in anything by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction to them, but of your salvation, and this from God,

29. because to you has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on behalf of him,

30. having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear about in me.

11. and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.   

12.  Holding Fast to the Word of Life Therefore my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

13. For the one at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure, is God.

14. Do all things without grumbling and disputing,

15. in order that you may become blameless and innocent, children of God without faultOr “blameless” in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars in the world,Or possibly “in the universe”

22. But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel.

23. Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see ⌞my circumstances⌟Literally “the things concerning me”.

24. And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will arrive shortly also.  

25.  Epaphroditus’ Mission But I considered itHere the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your messenger and servant of my need,

26. because he was longing for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
