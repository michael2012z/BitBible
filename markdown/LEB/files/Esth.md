3. And the king’s servants who were at the gate of the king said to Mordecai, “Why are you transgressing the command of the king?”

4. They spoke to him day after day, but he did not listen to them, and they informed Haman to see if ⌞Mordecai’s resolve would prevail⌟;Literally “the word’s of Mordecai would stand” for he had told them that he was a Jew.

5. And Haman saw that Mordecai was not kneeling and bowing down to him, and he was filled with anger.

15. Esther replied to Mordecai:

16. “Go, gather all the Jews that are found in Susa and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, both night and day. I and my young girls will fast likewise, and then I will go to the king, which is not according to the law; if I perish, I perish.

15. And the Jews were gathered who were in Susa, and on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed in Susa three hundred men, but they did not ⌞touch⌟Literally “send their hand to” the plunder. 

16. The rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered and ⌞defended their lives⌟Literally “to stand for their lives” and ⌞found repose⌟Literally “rested” from their enemies. And they killed seventy-five thousand of those that hated them, but they did not ⌞touch⌟Literally “send their hand to” the plunder.

17. This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day of feasting and joy.

18. But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day, and rested on the fifteenth day. And they made it a day of feasting and joy.

19. Therefore the Jews in the rural areas, living in the rural towns, made the fourteenth month of Adar a day of joy and feasting, a festive day of giving gifts to each other.  

20.  The Feast of Purim Mordecai wrote down these things and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all of the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,

21. to impose on them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day, ⌞every year⌟,Literally “and every year and year”

22. as the day that the Jews ⌞found relief⌟Literally “rested” from their enemies, and the month which changed for them from sorrow to joy, and from a mourning ceremony to a ⌞festive day⌟;Literally “a day of good” to make them days of feasting and joy, and giving gifts to each other and to the poor.

23. And the Jews adopted what they had begun to do and what Mordecai had written to them. 

24. For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he had cast pur, that is the lot, to rout them out and destroy them.

25. But when it cameOr “she came” ⌞to the attention of⌟Literally “before” the king, he ⌞gave orders in writing⌟Literally “said with a scroll” that his evil plot that he had devised against the Jews should return on his head, and they hung him and his sons on the gallows.

26. Therefore they called these days Purim, because of the name Pur. Thus because of all the words of this letter, and of what they faced concerning this, and of what had happened to them,

27. the Jews established and adopted it for themselves and for their offspring, and for all who joined them. They did not neglect ⌞to observe⌟Literally “to be doing” these two days every year as it was written and appointed to them.

28. These days are to be remembered and are to be kept in every generation, and in family, province, and city; and these days of Purim are not to be neglected among the Jews, and their memory shall not come to an end among their offspring. 

29. So Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew wrote in full authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.

30. He sent letters of words of peace and truth to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provincesHebrew “province” of Ahasuerus’ kingdom,

31. to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had imposed, and just as they had imposed on themselves and their offspring regulations of the fast and their lament.

32. And the command of Esther established these practices of Purim, and it was written on the scroll.
