1.  God Commands Hosea to Start a Family The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 

2.  ⌞At the beginning when Yahweh spoke⌟Literally “At the beginning of the talking of Yahweh” through Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife and children of whoredom, because the land commits great whoredom ⌞forsaking Yahweh⌟.”Literally “from behind Yahweh” 

3. So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. 

4. And Yahweh said to him, “⌞Name him⌟Literally “Call his name” Jezreel;Jezreel means “God sows” because in a little while ⌞I will punish⌟Literally “I will visit sin upon” the house of JehuOr “the dynasty of Jehu” for the bloodOr “bloodshed” of Jezreel,Jezreel means “God sows” and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.Or “the dynasty of Israel”

9. And heYahweh said, “⌞Name him⌟Literally “Call his name” Lo-ammi,Lo-ammi means “not my people” for you are not my people and I am not your God.Hebrew “not yours” 

10. Hosea 1:10–2:23 in the English Bible is 2:1–25 in the Hebrew Bible The number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea that cannot be measured or counted; and in the place where it is said to them, “You are not my people,” it will be said to them, “Children of the living God.” 

11. Then the children of Judah and Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint for themselves one head; and ⌞they will take possession of⌟Literally “they will go up from” the land, for great is the day of Jezreel.Jezreel means “God sows”

1.  The Unfaithful Wife  Say to your brother,Hebrew “brothers” “Ammi,”Ammi means “My people” and to your sister,Hebrew “sisters” “Ruhamah.”Ruhamah means “Pitied” 

2. Plead with your mother, plead— because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her put away her whoring ⌞from before her⌟,Literally “from her face” and her adultery from between her breasts. 

3. Lest I strip her naked and expose her like the day when she was born; I will make her like the desert and turn her into parched land; I will kill her with thirst. 

4. And I will not have pity on her children, because they are children of whoredom. 

5. Because their mother was unfaithful;Or “their mother played the whore” she who conceived them has acted shamefully, for she said: “I will go after my lovers, the ones who give me my bread, my water, my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink.” 

6. Therefore, Look! I am going to hedge her pathHebrew “your path” ⌞with thorns⌟,Literally “with the thorns” and I will build a stone wall, a stone wall against her, and she will not find her paths. 

7. Then she will pursue ⌞her lovers⌟,Literally “the ones who love her” but she will not overtake them; she will seek them and not find them; and she will say, “I will go and return to my first husband because it was better for me then than now.” 

8. But she did not know that it was I who gave her grain, new wine, and oil, and who gave her silver in abundance, and gold which they made into a Baal. 

9. Therefore I will take again my grain in its time, and my wine in its season; and I will take away my wool and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness. 

10. And now I will uncover her nakedness before the eyes of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from my hand. 

11. And I will put an end to all her mirth, her festivals,Hebrew “festival” her new moons,Hebrew “new moon” and her Sabbaths,Hebrew “Sabbath” and all her appointed festivals;Hebrew “festival” 

12. and I will lay waste to her vinesHebrew “vine” and her fig trees,Hebrew “fig tree” of which she said, “They are my payment for prostitution, which my lovers gave to me.” I will make them a forest, and the wild animalsHebrew “animal” of the field will devour them. 

13. ⌞I will punish her⌟Literally “To visit sins upon her;” see 1:4 for the days of the Baals, to whom she burns incense, and she decked herself with her ornamental ring and jewelry, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me —a declaration of Yahweh. 

14. Therefore, Look! I am going to allure her and bring her into the desert, and ⌞I will speak tenderly to her⌟.Literally “I will speak to her heart” 

15. From there I will give her her vineyards, and the Valley of Achor as a doorway of hope. And there she will respond, as in the days of her youth, just as in the day of her coming out of the land of Egypt. 

16. ⌞And on that day⌟—Literally, “And it will happen on that day” a declaration of Yahweh— you will call me, “My husband;”Hebrew “Ishi” you will no longer call me, “My Baal.”Hebrew “Baali” 

17. I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they will no longer be mentioned by their name. 

18. I will make a covenant for them on that day, with the animalsHebrew “animal” of the field, with the birdsHebrew “bird” of the heaven, and with the creeping thingsHebrew “creeping thing” of the ground; the bow, the sword, and the war I will abolish from the land, and I will let them lie down in safety.

## Hosea 3

1.  Another Symbolic Marriage  And Yahweh said to me again, “Go, love a woman ⌞who has a lover⌟Literally “who is beloved of a friend” and is committing adultery, just like the love of Yahweh for the children of Israel, but they are turning to other gods and love raisin cakes.” 

2. So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer of barely and a measure of wine.Hebrew “a measure of barley”; the LXX has “a nebel of wine,” although some modern translations, e.g. NASB, have “a homer and a half of barley” 

3. And I said to her, “⌞You must remain as mine⌟Literally “You must sit at home for me” for many days, and you will not play the whore; ⌞you will not belong⌟Literally “you will not be” to a man, and I will belong to you.” 

4. The children of Israel will remain for many days without a king and prince, without sacrifice and stone pillar, ephod and teraphim.

## Hosea 4

1.  Yahweh Has an Indictment  Hear the word of Yahweh, O children of Israel, for Yahweh has an indictment against the inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness or loyalty, there is no knowledge of God in the land. 

2. Swearing and lying, murdering and stealing, and adultery break out,The LXX adds “and adultery breaks out in the land” and bloodshed follows bloodshed. 

3. Therefore the land mourns, and all those living in it languish with the animals of the field, and the birds of the heaven, and even the fish of the sea are being swept away. 

4. Yet, let no one contend, and let no one accuse, for with you, O priest, is my contention.The Hebrew is unclear; the NASB translates “For your people are like those who contend with the priest” 

5. You will stumble by day, and the priest also will stumble with you at night. And I will destroy your mother; 

6. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from acting as a priest for me.Or “to me” And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.Hebrew “sons”

13. On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, and on the hills they make offerings, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because theirHebrew “its” shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the whore, and all your daughters-in-lawOr “brides” commit adultery. 

14. ⌞I will not punish your daughters⌟Literally “I will not visit sins upon your daughters” when they play the whore, or your daughters-in-lawOr “brides” when they commit adultery; because they go aside with whores, and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes, a people that does not understand comes to ruin.
