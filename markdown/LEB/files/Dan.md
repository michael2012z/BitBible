## Daniel 1

1.  Daniel’s Development in the King’s Court In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.

2. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand and ⌞some of⌟Literally “from the end/extremity/limits” of the utensils of the temple of God,Hebrew “the God” and he brought them to the land of Shinar to the temple of his gods, and he brought the utensils to ⌞the treasury⌟Literally “the house of the treasury” of his gods. 

3. And the king ⌞ordered⌟Literally “said to” Ashpenaz, the commander of his court officials, to bring ⌞some of the Israelites⌟Literally “from the sons/children of Israel” from ⌞the royal family⌟Literally “from the seed of the kingship” and from the lords,Or “nobles”

4. youths who ⌞have no physical defect⌟,Literally “there is not in them any physical defect” and who are ⌞handsome⌟,Literally “good/pleasing of appearance” and who are prudentOr “insightful” in all wisdom and ⌞endowed with knowledge⌟,Literally “who have knowledge of knowledge” and who understand insight, and who have the ⌞ability⌟Literally “strength” in them to serve in the palace of the king. And the king ordered him to teach them the literature and the language of the Chaldeans.

5. And the king assigned to them ⌞his daily portion⌟Literally “the portion of the day on its day” from the fine food of the king, and from ⌞the wine that he drank⌟,Literally “the wine of his drink” and instructed that ⌞they were to be educated for three years⌟.Literally “and to be educated them years three” And at the end of their training, ⌞they were to be stationed⌟Literally “they would stand” ⌞before⌟Literally “to the face of” the king.

6. Now there was among them ⌞from the Judeans⌟,Literally “from the children of Judah” Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.

7. And the commander of the court officials gave them names, and he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.  

8.  Daniel’s Resolve Now ⌞Daniel resolved⌟Literally “Daniel placed upon his heart” that he would not defile himself with the fine food of the king, and with ⌞the wine that he drank⌟,Literally “the wine of his drink” and so he requested from the commander of the court officials permission so that he would not defile himself.

9. And GodHebrew “the God” gave Daniel favor and compassion ⌞before⌟Literally “to the face of” the commander of the court officials,

10. and the commander of the court officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord, the king, who has determined your food and your drink, for ⌞why should⌟Literally “to what would” he see your face having a worse appearance than the young men who ⌞are your age⌟?Literally “like your age”; “your” is plural Then you will endanger my head with the king.”

11. ThenHebrew “And” Daniel asked the guardOr “overseer” whom the commander of the court officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

12. “Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us ⌞some of the vegetables⌟,Literally “from the vegetables” and let us eat and let us drink water.

13. ThenHebrew “And” let our appearances and the appearance of the young men who are eating the fine food of the king be compared ⌞before you⌟,Literally “in your presence” and then deal with your servants ⌞according to what you see⌟.”Literally “and according to/that you see”

14. So he agreed to this proposal with them, and he tested them for ten days.

15. And at the end of ten days their appearances appeared better and they were healthier of body than all the young men who were eating the fine food of the king.

16. ⌞So⌟Literally “And it happened” the guard ⌞continued to withhold⌟Literally “he was … withdrawing” their fine food and the wine of their drink, and he gave themHebrew “to them” vegetables. 

17. ⌞And as for these four young men⌟,Literally “And these young men, four of them” GodHebrew “the God” gave to them knowledge and insight into all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had insight into all visionsHebrew “vision” and dreams.

18. And at the end of the time the king had set to bring them, the commander of the court officials brought them in ⌞before⌟Literally “to the face of” Nebuchadnezzar.

19. And the king spoke with them, ⌞and among all of them no one was found like⌟Literally “and he was not found from all of them like” Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; then they stood ⌞before⌟Literally “to the face of” the king.

20. And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired from them, he found them ten times better than all of the magiciansOr “soothsayer-priests” and conjurersOr “enchanters” that ⌞were in his entire kingdom⌟.Literally “in the whole of his kingdom”

21. And Daniel was there until the first year of Cyrus the king.   

## Daniel 2

1.  The King’s Troubling Dream NowHebrew “And” in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.

2. So the king said to call the magiciansOr “soothsayer-priests” and the conjurersOr “enchanters” and the sorcerers and the ⌞astrologers⌟Literally “Chaldeans” to tell to the king his dreams. And they came in and they stood ⌞before⌟Literally “to the face of” the king.

3. And the king said to them, “⌞I have had a dream⌟Literally “A dream I have dreamed” and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.” 

4. And the ⌞astrologers⌟Literally “Chaldeans” said to the king in Aramaic,The text of Daniel is in Aramaic from this point on through Daniel chapter 7. Then the text resumes in Hebrew to the end of the book “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will reveal the explanation.”

5. The king answered and said to the ⌞astrologers⌟,Literally “Chaldeans” “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its explanation,Or “interpretation” then you will be broken into pieces and your houses will be laid in ruins.

6. But if you tell me the dream and its explanation, you will receive gifts and rewardsAramaic “reward” and great honor from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its explanation.”Or “interpretation”

7. They answered once more and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants and we will make the explanation known.”

8. The king answered and said, “⌞Certainly⌟Literally “From a certainty” I know that ⌞you are trying to gain time⌟Literally “the time you are gaining” ⌞because⌟Literally “all because of that” you have seen ⌞that this matter is firmly decreed by me⌟,Literally “that firm from me is the decree”

9. for if you do not make the dream known to me, ⌞your verdict is fixed⌟,Literally “one is your verdict” and you have conspired to say a lying and deceitful word to me until the ⌞circumstances⌟Literally “time” will change. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me its explanation.”

10. The ⌞astrologers⌟Literally “Chaldeans” answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth that is able to reveal the word of the king; ⌞in fact⌟,Literally “all because that” no great and powerful king has ever asked a thing like this of any magicianOr “soothsayer-priest” or conjurerOr “enchanter” or ⌞astrologer⌟.Literally “Chaldean”

11. And the thing that the king is asking is too difficult and ⌞there is no one who⌟Literally “there is not another” can reveal it to the king except the gods ⌞whose dwelling is not with mortals⌟.”Literally “concerning their dwelling is not with flesh” 

12. Because of this the king became angry, and he became very much enraged, and he said that all the wise men of Babylon are to be destroyed.

13. And the decree was issued, and the wise men ⌞were on the verge of being executed⌟,Literally “were in the process of being killed” and they searched for Daniel and his companions to be executed.

14. Then Daniel responded prudently and discretely to Arioch, the commander of the imperial guard of the king, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.

15. ⌞He asked⌟Literally “he answered” and said to Arioch, the royal official of the king, “⌞Why⌟Literally “Over what” is the decree from the king so severe?” Then Arioch explained the matterOr “situation” to Daniel.

16. And Daniel went in and requested from the king that he would give him time, and ⌞he would tell the king⌟Literally “to tell/reveal to the king” the explanation.Or “interpretation” 

17. Then Daniel went to his home, and he made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions,

18. and told them to seek mercy ⌞from the God of heaven⌟Literally “from before the God of the heaven” concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions, along with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon, would not be killed. 

19. Then in a vision of the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 

20. Daniel ⌞said⌟:Literally “answered and he said”  “Let his name, the name of God,Aramaic “the God” be blessed ⌞throughout the ages⌟,Literally “from the age unto the age” for the wisdom and the power ⌞are his⌟.Literally “of to him it is” 

21. And he changes the times and the seasons, and he deposes kings and he sets up kings; he gives wisdomAramaic “the wisdom” to wise men and knowledge to men who know understanding. 

22. He reveals the deep and the hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him. 

23. To you, O God of my ancestors,Or “fathers” I give thanks and I give praises, for the wisdom and the power you gave to me, and now you have made known to me what we have asked from you, for you have made known to us the matter of the king.”   

24.  Daniel Praises God and Interprets the King’s Dream ⌞Therefore⌟Literally “Now because this” Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointedAramaic “has appointed” to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and thus he said to him: “You must not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me in before the king and I will give the explanationOr “interpretation” to the king.” 

25. Then Arioch ⌞quickly⌟Literally “in haste” brought Daniel in before the king and thus he said to him: “I have found a man among ⌞the exiles⌟Literally “the children of exiles” of JudahAramaic “Jehud” who ⌞can relate⌟Literally “he will make known” the explanationOr “interpretation” to the king.

26. ⌞The king then asked⌟Literally “The king answered” and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its explanation?”Or “interpretation”

27. Daniel answered the king and said, “The mystery that the king asks, no wise men, conjurers,Or “enchanters” magicians,Or “soothsayer-priests” or diviners are able to make known to the king.

28. But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what it is that will be at the end of days. This is your dream and the visions of your head on your bed. 

29. “As for you, king,Aramaic “the king” your thoughts on your bed ⌞turned to⌟Literally “they went up” what it was that would be ⌞in the future⌟,Literally “after this” and the revealer of mysteries has made known to you what that would be.

30. And as for me, it is not because of wisdom that is in me more than ⌞any other living person⌟Literally “all of living beings” that this mystery is revealed to me, but ⌞in order that⌟Literally “concerning the matter of” the explanationOr “interpretation” may be made known to the king and you will ⌞understand⌟Literally “know” the thoughts of your ⌞mind⌟.Literally “heart” 

31. “You, O king, were looking and, look, there was one great statue. This statue was huge and its brilliance extraordinary, standing there before you, and its appearance was frightening.Or “dreadful”

32. The head of this statue was of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,

33. its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron and part of them of clay.

34. You were looking on ⌞until⌟Literally “until that” a stone was chiseled outOr “became loose”—that not by hands—and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and it broke them in pieces.

35. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold ⌞all at once⌟Literally “like one” broke into piecesOr “were crushed” and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away and any trace of them could not be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and it filled the whole earth. 

36. “This was the dream, and now we will tell its interpretation to the king.

37. You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power and the might and the glory,

38. and also ⌞human beings wherever they dwell⌟,Literally “and into all that dwell sons of humankind” the animals of the field and the birdsAramaic “bird” of heavenOr “the sky”—he has given into your hand and made you ruler over all of them—you are the head of gold.

39. And after you another kingdom inferior to yours will arise, and another third kingdom of bronze that will rule over the whole earth.

40. And a fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, and ⌞just as⌟Literally “all of because” iron crushes and smashes ⌞everything⌟,Literally “the whole thing” and as iron shatters all of these other metals, so it will crush and it will shatter these nations.

41. ⌞And just as⌟Literally “And that” you saw the feet and the toes, ⌞partly potter’s clay⌟Literally “from them clay of the potter” and ⌞partly iron⌟,Literally “from them iron” it will be a divided kingdom; and ⌞some hardness⌟Literally “from the hardness” of the iron will be in it, ⌞just as⌟Literally “all of because that” you have seen the iron mixed with the wet clay.

42. And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so part of the kingdom will be strong ⌞and partly brittle⌟.Literally “and from it, it will be brittle”

43. And in that you saw the iron was mixed with wet clay, so ⌞they will mix in marriage⌟Literally “mixing they will in the seed of man” and they will not cling ⌞to one another⌟,Literally “this one with that one” just as iron does not mix with clay.

44. And ⌞in the day of those kings⌟,Literally “in their days of those kings” the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will ⌞never⌟Literally “to forever not” be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left for another nation,Or “people” and it will bring an end to all these kingdoms, but it will stand ⌞forever⌟.Literally “to eternity”

45. ⌞Inasmuch as⌟Literally “All of because that” you saw that a stone from the mountain was chiseled outOr “became loose” but not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, thereby the great God made known to the king what will be ⌞in the future⌟,Literally “after this” and the dream is certain and its explanation trustworthy.”  

46.  The King’s Response to Daniel and His God Then the king, Nebuchadnezzar, fell on his face and he paid homage to Daniel; and he commanded them to offer a grain offering and incense offering to him.

47. The king answered Daniel and said, “⌞Truly⌟Literally “From truth that” your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and he reveals mysteries, for you are able to reveal this mystery.”

48. Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.

49. And Daniel made a request from the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the court of the king.   

## Daniel 3

4. Then the herald proclaimed ⌞aloud⌟,Literally “with power” “To you ⌞it is commanded⌟,Literally “they are saying” O peoples, ⌞nations and people of all languages⌟,Literally “the nations and the languages”

5. that at the time that you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp, the drum and all kinds of music, you must fall down and you must worship the statue of goldAramaic “the gold” that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.

6. And ⌞whoever⌟Literally “who that” does not fall down and worship will be thrown ⌞immediately⌟Literally “the time” into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.”

9. ⌞They responded and said⌟Literally “they answered and were saying” to Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, may you live ⌞forever⌟!Literally “to eternity”

11. ⌞And whoever⌟Literally “And who that” ⌞does not fall down⌟Literally “not he falls down” and worship shall be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.

13. Then Nebuchadnezzar said in rage and anger to bring in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; then they brought in these men before the king.

14. Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you are not serving my god, and you are not worshiping the statue of goldAramaic “the gold” that I have set up?

15. Now if you are ready so that ⌞when⌟Literally “at that time” you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp and the drum and all kinds of music, you fall down and you worship the statue that I have made, that will be good. But if you do not worship it, ⌞immediately⌟Literally “at that very time” you will be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and ⌞who is the god⌟Literally “who he god” whoOr “that” will rescue you from my hands?” 

16. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king, Nebuchadnezzar, “We have no need on this matter ⌞to present a defense to you⌟.Literally “to return to you”

17. ⌞If it is so⌟,Literally “If there is” our God, whom we serve, is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire. And from your hand, O king, let him rescue us.

18. And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that ⌞we will not serve your gods⌟,Literally “your gods not there is us serving” and the statue of goldAramaic “the gold” that you have set up we will not worship.”  

19.  The Wrath of the King and His Fiery Furnace of Death Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger and the image of his face was changed ⌞toward⌟Literally “against” Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, so he ⌞ordered and said⌟Literally “answering and saying” to heat up the one furnace seven times what was usual to heat it up.

20. And he commanded ⌞the strongest men of the guards⌟Literally “to the strong men, men of strength” who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.

21. Then these men were bound with their garments, their trousers and their turbans and their other clothing, and they were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.

22. ⌞Therefore⌟Literally “because of this” ⌞because⌟Literally “from that” the word of the king was severe and the furnace was exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed these men who lifted up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

23. But these men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, fell down into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and they were bound. 

24. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and he rose up in haste and he asked, saying to his advisers, “Did we not throw three men, bound, into the midst of the fire? They answered, saying to the king, “Certainly, O king!”

25. ⌞He answered⌟,Literally “was answering” saying, “Look, I see four men unbound walking in the midst of the fire and there is no damage to them, and theAramaic “its” appearance of the fourth man resembles the son of a god.”

26. Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire, and he called out, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, ⌞servants⌟Literally “his servant” of the Most High God, come outOr “Go out” and come here!”

27. And the satraps, the prefects, the governors and the advisors of the king were assembling, and they saw these men, that the fire had no power over their bodies, and the hair of their heads wasAramaic plural not singed, and their garments were not harmed, and the smell of fire did not come from them.

29. And from me ⌞is set forth⌟Literally “setting out” a decree that any people, nation, or language that may utter criticism against their God—the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—will be broken into pieces and theirAramaic “his” house will be made like ruins. ⌞For⌟Literally “All of because” there is not another God who is able to rescue like this God.”

14. And I have heard that a spirit of the gods is in you and enlightenment and insight and excellent wisdom was found in you.

15. And now the wise men and the conjurersOr “enchanters” were brought in before me so that they could read this writing in order to make its explanationOr “interpretation” known to me, but they were not able to disclose the explanationOr “interpretation” of the matter.

16. But I have heard concerning you that you are able ⌞to produce interpretations⌟Literally “to interpret interpretations” and to solve riddles; now if you are able to read the writing and to make known its explanationOr “interpretation” to me, you will be clothed in purple and a necklace of gold will be placed around your neck and you will rule as third in command in the kingdom.”

18. ⌞O king⌟,Literally “You, O king” the Most High God gave the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your ⌞predecessor⌟.Literally “father”

19. And because of the greatness that he gave to him, all the peoples, the nations and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wanted he killed, and whomever he wanted he let live, and whomever he wanted he honored, and whomever he wanted he humbled.

22. “But you his ⌞successor⌟,Literally “son” Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart ⌞even though⌟Literally “all of because that” you knew all this.

23. And now you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of his temple you have brought in before you, and you and your lords,Or “nobles” your wives and your concubines, have been drinking wine fromAramaic “with” them, and you have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stoneAll the materials in this list have the definite article that does not have to be translated into English that do not see and do not hear and do not know, but the God ⌞who holds your life in his hand⌟Literally “who your breath is in his hand” and all of your ways ⌞come from him⌟,Literally “belong to him” you have not honored.

26. “This is the explanation of the matter:Or “word, message” ‘Mene’—God has numbered your kingdom and brought an end to it.

7. All of the administrators of the kingdom, and the prefects, the satraps, the counselors and the governors took counsel and have agreed to establish an edict of the king and to enforce a decree that ⌞whoever⌟Literally “all that” will seek a prayer from any god or human except from you for up to thirty days will be thrown into ⌞the lion pit⌟.Literally “pit of lions”

The king then commanded, and these men were brought ⌞who had accused Daniel⌟,Literally “they ate his pieces of Daniel” and they threw them and their children and their wives into ⌞the lion pit⌟,Literally “pit of lions” and they had not reached the floor of the pit ⌞before⌟Literally “until that” the lions had overpowered them and they had crushed all of their bones.
