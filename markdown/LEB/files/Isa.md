# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1.  Superscription The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  

2.  Rebellious Judah  Hear, heavens, and listen, earth, for Yahweh has spoken: “I reared children and I brought them up, but they rebelled against me. 

3. An ox knows its owner and a donkey the manger of its master. Israel does not know; my people do not understand. 

4. Ah, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly. They have forsaken Yahweh; they have despised the holy one of Israel. They are estranged and gone backward. 

5. Why do you want to be beaten again? You continue in rebellion. The whole of the head is sick, and the whole of the heart is faint. 

6. From the sole of the foot and up to the head there is no health in it; bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed, and they have not been bound up and not softened with the oil. 

7. Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire; As for your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence, and it is desolate, like devastation by foreigners. 

8. And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a city that is besieged.Or “preserved” 

9. If Yahweh of hosts had not left us survivors,Hebrew “survivor” we would have been as few as Sodom, we would have become like Gomorrah. 

10. Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah! 

11. What is the abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Yahweh. I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened animals and I do not delight in the blood of bulls and ram-lambs and goats. 

12. When you come to appear before me, who asked for this from your hand: you trampling my courts? 

13. You must not ⌞continue⌟Literally “increase” or “add to” to bring offeringsHebrew “offering” of futility, incense—it is an abomination to me; new moon and Sabbath, the calling of a convocation— I cannot endure iniquity with solemn assembly. 

14. Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become to me like a burden, I am not able to bear them. 

15. And when you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers,Hebrew “prayer” I will not be listening. Your hands are full of blood.

16. Wash! Make yourselves clean! Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes! Cease to do evil!

17. Learn to do good! Seek justice! Rescue the oppressed! Defend the orphan! Plead for the widow! 

18. “Come now, and let us argue,” says Yahweh. “Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow; even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. 

19. If you are willing and you are obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. 

20. But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword.  For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.”  

21.  Purifying Jerusalem  How has a faithful city become like a whore? Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. 

22. Your silver has become as dross; Your wine is diluted with waters. 

23. Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Every one loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend the orphan and the legal dispute of the widow does not come before them. 

24. Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: “Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies, and I will avenge myself on my foes. 

25. And I will turn my hand against you; I will purify your dross like lye, and I will remove all of your tin. 

26. And I will restore your judges, as at the first, and your counselors, as at the beginning. After this ⌞you will be called⌟Literally “it will be called for you” the city of righteousness, faithful city. 

27. Zion will be redeemed by justice, and those of her who repent, by righteousness. 

28. But the destruction of rebels and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake Yahweh will perish. 

29. For youLiterally “they,” but a few manuscripts read “you,” which fits the context better will be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted, and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. 

30. For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves, and like a garden where there is no water for her. 

31. And the strong man shall become like tinder, and his work like a spark. And both of them shall burn together, and there is not one to quench them.”

3. many peoples shall come. And they shall say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the houseOr “temple” of the God of Jacob, and may he teach us part of his ways, and let us walk in his paths.” For instruction shall go out from Zion, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. 

4. He shall judge between the nations and he shall arbitrate for many peoples. They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. A nation shall not lift up a sword against a nation, and they shall not learn war again.   

5.  The Day of Yahweh  House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.

7. And its land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to its treasures; and its land is filled with horses, and there is no end to its chariots. 

8. Its land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of theirHebrew “his” hands, to what they made with theirHebrew “his” fingers.

7. He will lift up his voice on that day, saying, “I will not be a healer; in my house there is no bread and there is no cloak. You shall not make me the leader of the people!” 

8. For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen because their speech and their deeds are against Yahweh, defying the eyes of his glory.

The Song of the Vineyard  Let me sing for my beloved a song of my love concerning his vineyard: ⌞My beloved had a vineyard⌟Literally “A vineyard was for my beloved” on ⌞a fertile hill⌟.Literally “a horn of a son of olive oil.” The Hebrew for horn, qeren, sounds like the Hebrew for vineyard, kerem

3. And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and menHebrew “man” of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. 

4. What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why did I hope for it to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes?

7. For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the manOr “people” of Judah is the plantation of his delight. And he waited for justice,The Hebrew word, mishpat, sounds like mishpakh in the next line but look! Bloodshed!The Hebrew word, mishpakh, sounds like mishpat in the previous line For righteousness,The Hebrew word, tsedaqah, sounds like tsa`aqah in the next line but look! A cry of distress!The Hebrew word, tsa`aqah, sounds like tsedaqah in the previous line   

8.  Woes on the Wicked  Ah! Those who ⌞join⌟Literally “touch” house with house, they join field together with field until ⌞there is no place⌟Literally “an end of place” and you are caused to dwell alone in the midst of the land.

12. And there will be lyre and harp, tambourine and flute, and wine at their feasts, but they do not look at the deedsHebrew “deed” of Yahweh, and they do not see the work of his hands. 

13. Therefore my people will go into exile without knowledge, and theirHebrew “its” noblesHebrew “noble” will be men of hunger, and theirHebrew “its” multitude is parched with thirst. 

14. Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat, and it has opened wide its mouth without limit, and herThat is, Jerusalem’s noblesHebrew “noble” will go down, and her multitude, her tumult and those who revel in her. 

15. And humankind is bowed down, and man is brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are humiliated. 

16. But Yahweh of hosts is exalted by justice, and the holy God shows himself holy by righteousness. 

17. And then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, and ⌞fatlings, kidsFollowing the Septuagint, which reads the Hebrew grym (resident aliens) as gdym (young goats/sheep) will eat among the sites of ruins.⌟Literally “and ruins, fatlings, resident aliens, will eat” 

18. Ah! Those who drag iniquity along with the cords of falsehood and sin as with rope of the cart,

21. Ah! Those who are wise in their own eyes and have understanding ⌞in their view⌟!Literally “before their faces” 

22. Ah! Heroes at drinking wine, and men of capability at mixing strong drink! 

23. Those who acquit the guilty because of a bribe and remove the justice of the innocent from him. 

24. Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will become like the stench, and their blossom will go up like the dust. For they have rejected the instruction of Yahweh of hosts, and they have treated the word of the holy one of Israel with contempt. 

25. Therefore ⌞Yahweh’s wrath was kindled⌟Literally “the anger of Yahweh became hot” against his people, and he stretched out his hand against themHebrew “it” and struck them,Hebrew “it” and the mountains quaked, and their corpsesHebrew “corpse” were like refuse in the middle of the streets.

27. None is weary, and none among him stumbles; none slumbers and none sleeps. And no loincloth on his waist is opened, and no thong of his sandals is drawn away. 

28. Whose arrows are sharp, and all of his bows are bent. The hoofs of his horses are reckoned like flint, and his wheels like the storm wind. 

29. His roaring is like the lion, and he roars like young lions. And he growls and seizes his prey, and he carries it off, and not one can rescue it. 

30. And he will roar over him on that day like the roaring of the sea, and if one looks to the land, look! Darkness! Distress! And the light grows dark with itsPresumably the land’s clouds.

7. And he touched my mouth, and he said,  “Look! This has touched your lips and has removed your guilt, and your sin is annulled.”  

8. Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,  “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?”  And I said,  “I am here! Send me!”  

9. And he said, “Go and say to this people,  ‘Keep on listening and do not comprehend! And keep on looking and do not understand!’ 

10. Make the heart of this people insensitive, and make its ears unresponsive, and shut its eyes so that it may not look with its eyes and listen with its ears and comprehend with its mind and turn back, and it may be healed for him.”  

11. Then I said, “Until when, Lord?” And he said,  “Until the cities lie wasted without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is ruined and a waste, 

12. and Yahweh sends the people far away, and the abandonment is great in the midst of the land. 

13. And ⌞even if only a tenth part remain⌟,Literally “still in her a tenth” ⌞again she will be destroyed⌟Literally “and she will again and she will be to burn” like a terebinth or like an oak, which although felled, a tree stump remains in them. The seed of holiness will be her tree stump.”

9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not believe then you will not endure.” ’ ” 

10. And Yahweh continued to speak to Ahaz, saying,

19. And all of them will come and settle in the rivers of the cliffs and in the clefts of the rocks and on all of the thornbushes and watering places.

20. On that day, the Lord will shave the head and the hair of the feet with a razor of the one hired from beyond the river—with the king of Assyria—and it will even take off the beard.

8.  Yahweh’s Anger against Arrogance  The Lord has sent out a word against Jacob, and it fell on Israel. 

9. And all of the people knew it, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria in pride and arrogance of heart, saying, 

10. “The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stone. The sycamore-fig trees were felled, but we will replace them with cedars.” 

11. So Yahweh strengthened ⌞the adversaries of Rezin⌟Or “his adversaries” if a copyist added “of Rezin” in error against him, and he provoked his enemies— 

12. Aram from the east and PhilistinesHebrew “Philistine” from the west— and they devoured Israel with the whole mouth. He has not turned away his anger in all of this, and his hand is still stretched out. 

13. And the people did not turn to the one who struck it,That is, the people and they did not seek Yahweh of hosts. 

14. So Yahweh cut off head and tail from Israel, palm branch and reed in one day. 

15. EldersHebrew “Elder” and ⌞the respectable⌟Literally “one lifted up of face” are the head, and prophetsHebrew “prophet” who teach liesHebrew “lie” are the tail. 

16. And the leaders of this people were misleading them, and those who were led were confused. 

17. Therefore the Lord did not rejoice over its young men, and he did not have compassion on its orphans and widows, for everyone was godless and an evildoer, and every mouth was speaking folly. In all of this his anger did not turn away, and still his hand is stretched out. 

18. For wickedness burned like fire; it consumed brier and thorn. And it kindled the thickets of the forest, and they swirled upward in a column of smoke. 

19. The land was burned through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts, and the people became like fire fuel. ⌞People had no compassion toward each other⌟.Literally “A man does not have compassion toward his brother” 

20. They devoured on the right but still were hungry and devoured on the left but they were not satisfied. Each one devoured the flesh of his arm, 

21. Manasseh devoured Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh; together they were against Judah. In all of this his anger has not turned away, and still his hand is stretched out.    

## Isaiah 10

1.  Woes on the Wicked  Ah! Those who decree decrees of evil, and writers who have written harm, 

2. to guide the needy away from legal claims,Hebrew “claim” and to rob the justice from the poor of my people, to make widows their spoil; and they plunder orphans. 

3. And what will you do at the day of punishment, and at calamity? It comes from afar! To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth, 

4. ⌞save that they bow down under the prisoners and fall under the slain⌟?Literally “except he will bow down under a prisoner and under slain they will fall”; “under” could also mean “in the place of” In all of this his anger has not turned away, and still his hand is stretched out.   

5.  Judgment on Assyria’s Arrogance  Ah! Assyria, the rod of my anger, and a staff is in their hand: my wrath! 

6. I send him against a godless nation, and I command him against the people of my wrath, to capture spoil and to carry off plunder, and to make themHebrew “him” a trampling place, like the clay of the streets. 

7. But he does not think this,Or “so” and his heart does not plan this. For it is in his heart to destroy and to cut off not a few nations. 

8. For he says, “Are not my commanders altogether kings? 

9. Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus? 

10. As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idolsHebrew “idol” —and their images were ⌞greater than those of⌟Literally “from” Jerusalem and Samaria— 

11. shall I not do to Jerusalem and its idols what I have done to Samaria and her idols?”  

12. And this shall happen: when the Lord has finished all his work against ⌞Mount Zion⌟Literally “the mountain of Zion” and Jerusalem, “I will punish the ⌞arrogance⌟Literally “fruit of the greatness of the heart” of the king of Assyria and ⌞his haughtiness⌟.”Literally “the pride of the height of his eyes” 

13. For he says,  “I have done it by the strength of my hand and by my wisdom, for I have understanding, and I have removed the boundaries of peoples, and I have plundered their stores, and like a bull I have brought down ⌞the inhabitants⌟.Or, “those sitting,” that is, rulers sitting on thrones 

14. And my hand has found, like a nest, the wealth of the peoples, and like the gathering of forsaken eggs, I myself have gathered all the earth. And there was no fluttering wing or open mouth or chirp.” 

15. Does the ax boast against the one who cuts with it, or the saw magnify itself against the one who moves it to and fro? ⌞As if a rod should move the one who lifts it⌟!Literally “As a rod waving even the one who lifts it up” ⌞As if a staff should lift up that which is not wood⌟!Literally “As a staff lifting up not wood” 

16. Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, will send leanness among his sturdy warriors, and a burning like the burning of fire will burn under his glory. 

17. And the light of Israel will become like a fire, and his holy one like a flame, and it will burn and devour his thornsHebrew “thorn” and briersHebrew “brier” in one day. 

18. And he will destroy the glory of his forest and orchard ⌞completely⌟,Literally “from soul and to body” and it will be like the wasting away of one who is sick. 

19. And the rest of the treesHebrew “tree” of his forest will be a small number, and a boy can write them down.   

20.  The Return of the Remnant  And this shall happen: on that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivorsHebrew “survivor” of the house of Jacob will not continue to lean on the one who struck it but will lean on Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, in truth. 

21. A remnant will return— the remnant of Jacob—to the mighty God. 

22. For though your people Israel was like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of it will return. Annihilation is determined, overflowing with righteousness. 

23. For the Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to make a complete destruction and a determined end in the midst of all the earth.  

24. Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh of hosts:  “My people who live in Zion, you must not be afraid of Assyria. It beats you with the rod, and it lifts up its staff against you ⌞as the Egyptians did⌟.Literally “in the way of Egypt” 

25. My indignation will come to an end ⌞in just a very little while⌟,Literally “for still a little a trifle” and my anger will be directed to their destruction.” 

26. And Yahweh of hosts is going to swing a whip against him, as when Midian was defeated at the rock of Oreb; and his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift him up ⌞as he did in Egypt⌟.Literally “in the way of Egypt”  

27. And this shall happen: on that day,  he will remove his burden from your shoulder and his yoke from your neck, ⌞and a yoke will be destroyed because of fat⌟.The meaning of this phrase is uncertain, leading to the conjecture that it belongs with the next verse and by a different word division could mean “he has gone up from Jeshimon”; alternatively, “fat” could be a metaphor for prosperity 

28. He has come to Aiath, he has passed through Migron; at Micmash he deposited his baggage. 

29. They crossed over the pass; Geba is a place of overnight lodging for us. Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul has fled. 

30. Daughter of Gallim, cry out with your voice; Laishah, listen! ⌞Anathoth is poor⌟.Or with different vocalization, “Answer her, Anathoth!” which fits the parallelism better 

31. Madmenah flees! The inhabitants of Gebim bring themselves into safety! 

32. ⌞This day⌟Literally “Yet today” ⌞taking a stand⌟Literally “to stand” at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mountain of the daughterFollowing the reading tradition (Qere); the consonantal text has “house” of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem. 

33. Look! The Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to lop off the branchesHebrew “branch” with great power, and ⌞the towering trees⌟Literally “the haughty of the height” will be felled, and the ⌞tall trees⌟Literally “height” will be brought low. 

34. And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with the axe, and Lebanon will fall by the mighty one.    

## Isaiah 11

1.  The Branch’s Righteous Reign  And a shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from its roots will bear fruit. 

2. And the spirit of Yahweh shall rest on him— a spirit of wisdom and understanding, a spirit of counsel and might, a spirit of knowledge and the fear of Yahweh. 

3. And his ⌞breath⌟Hebrew “smelling,” perhaps metaphorically as “delight” as in Amos 5:14; perhaps this line was accidentally copied twice from the preceding line is in the fear of Yahweh.

4. But he shall judge the poor with righteousness, and he shall decide for the needy of the earth with rectitude. And he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and he shall kill the wicked person with the breath of his lips. 

5. And righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins. 

6. And a wolf shall ⌞stay⌟Literally “dwell as an alien” with a lamb, and a leopard shall lie down with a kid, and a calf and a lion and a fatling together ⌞as a small boy leads⌟Literally “and a small boy leading” them.

8. And ⌞an infant⌟Literally “one nursing” shall play over a serpent’s hole, and ⌞a toddler⌟Literally “one who is weaned” shall put his hand on a viper’s hole. 

9. They will not injure and they will not destroy on all of my ⌞holy mountain⌟,Literally “mountain of holiness” for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.  

10. And this shall happen on that day:  the nations shall inquire of the root of Jesse, which shall be standing as a signal to the peoples, and his resting place shall be glorious.   

11.  The Regathered Remnant And this shall happen on that day:  The Lord will again extend his hand a second time to acquire the remnant of his people that is left, from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands of the sea, 

12. and he will raise a signal for the nations. And he will gather the outcasts of Israel, and he will gather the scattered ones of Judah together from the four ⌞corners⌟Literally “wings” of the earth. 

13. And the jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah shall not be an enemy of Ephraim. 

14. But they shall ⌞swoop⌟Literally “fly” upon the Philistine shoulder,That is, the hill country west of Judah ⌞westward⌟.Literally “sea” Together they shall plunder the sons of the east. Edom and Moab ⌞will be under their command⌟,Literally “the stretching of their hand” and the sons of Ammon will be their subjugated people. 

15. And Yahweh will divideOr “utterly destroy” the tongueProbably the “gulf” of the sea of Egypt,That is, the Red Sea and he will wave his hand over the riverThat is, the Euphrates River with his scorching wind; and he will strike it into seven streams, and he will ⌞make it passable by foot⌟.Literally “cause to walk with the sandal” 

16. So there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of his people that remains, as there was for Israel ⌞when⌟Literally “in the day” it went up from the land of Egypt.

For it is blah-blah upon blah-blah, blah-blah upon blah-blah, gah-gah upon gah-gah, gah-gah upon gah-gah,In this context, the Hebrew expressions tsaw-tsaw and qaw-qaw are likely meant to sound like baby talk, but they could mean “command upon command” and “rule upon rule” a little here, a little there.  

11. For he will speak with ⌞stammering⌟Literally “stammer of lip” and another tongue to this people,

12. to whom he has said,  “This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose”; yetOr “and” they were not willing to hear.  

13. And to them the word of Yahweh will be  blah-blah upon blah-blah blah-blah upon blah-blah gah-gah upon gah-gah gah-gah upon gah-gah,In this context, the Hebrew expressions tsaw-tsaw and qaw-qaw are likely meant to sound like baby talk, but they could mean “command upon command” and “rule upon rule” a little here, a little there, so that they may go and stumble backward and be broken and ensnared and captured.   

14.  The Cornerstone of Zion  Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, men of mockery, rulers of these people in Jerusalem:  

15. Because you have said,  “We have ⌞made⌟Literally “cut” a covenant with death, and we have made an agreement with Sheol.  The overwhelming flood, when it passes through, will not come to us,  for we have made liesHebrew “lie” our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves in falsehood.”  

16. Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this:  “Look! I am laying a stone in Zion, a ⌞tested⌟Literally “testing” stone, a precious cornerstone, a founded foundation:  ‘The one who trusts will not ⌞panic⌟.’Literally “hurry” 

17.  And I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,Hebrew “lie” and waters will flood over the hiding place. 

18. And your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; you will become a trampling place for the overwhelming flood when it passes through. 

19. ⌞As often as it passes through⌟,Literally “From enough his passing through” it will take you, for ⌞morning by morning⌟Literally “in the morning in the morning” it will pass through, in the day and in the night,  and understanding the message will be only terror.” 

20.  For the bed is too short ⌞to stretch out on⌟,Literally “from stretching oneself” and the covering is too narrow when wrapping oneself. 

21. For Yahweh will rise up as at Mount Perazim; he will rave as in the valley at Gibeon to do his deed—his deed is strange— and to work his work—his work is alien! 

22. And now you must not scoff, or your bonds will be strong,  for I have heard from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts:  complete destruction decreed upon all the land.   

23.  A Parable of Yahweh’s Work  Listen, and hear my voice! Listen attentively, and hear my word! 

24. Is it all day that the plowman plows, opens to sow seed, harrows his ground? 

25. When he has leveled its ⌞surface⌟,Literally “face” does he not scatter dill, and sow cumin seed, and ⌞plant⌟Literally “place” wheat in planted rows,Hebrew “row” and barley in an appointed place, and spelt grain as its border? 

26. And his God instructs him about the prescription;That is, “the proper way” he teaches him. 

27. For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a wheel of a utility cart ⌞rolled⌟Literally “turned” over cumin, but dill is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod. 

28. Grain is crushed fine, but certainly one does not thresh it forever; and one drives the wheel of his cart, but his horses do not crush it.  

29. This also comes forth from Yahweh of hosts.  He is wonderful in advice; he makes great wisdom.    

## Isaiah 29

1.  Woe to Jerusalem Ah! Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped!  Add year to year, let festivals recur. 

2. YetOr “And” I will inflict Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation, and it shall be to me like an altar hearth.Hebrew “Ariel,” which might mean “altar hearth” 

3. And I will encamp ⌞in a circle⌟The Hebrew text literally reads “like the ball”; the LXX supports an emendation to “David” against you, and I will lay siege to you with towersHebrew “tower” and I will raise up siegeworks against you. 

4. ThenOr “And” you shall be low; you shall speak from the earth, and your wordsHebrew “word” will be low, from dust. And your voice will be from the earth, like a ghost, and your word will whisper from the dust. 

5. ButOr “And” the multitude of your strangers shall be like fine dust, and the multitude of tyrants like chaff that passes by.  And it will happen in an instant, suddenly. 

6. You will be punished by Yahweh of hosts  with thunder and earthquake and great sound, storm wind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire. 

7. And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, all those who fight against her and her stronghold, and those who inflict her shall be like a dream, a vision of the night. 

8. And it shall be as when the hungry person dreams—look, he is eating! And he wakes up and his inner self is empty. OrOr “And” as when the thirsty person dreams—look, he is drinking! And he wakes up and look, he is faint, and his inner self is longing for water. So shall be the multitude of all the nations who fight against Mount Zion. 

9. Be astonished and be amazed! Blind yourselves and be blinded! They are drunk butOr “and” not from wine; they stagger butOr “and” not from strong drink. 

10. For Yahweh has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and he has shut your eyes, the prophets, and he has covered your heads, the seers.  

11. And the vision of all this has become for you like the words of a sealed document. When they give it to one who knows theThe reading tradition (Qere) has “a” instead of “the” document, saying, “⌞Read⌟Literally “Call” this now!” He says, “I am not able, for it is sealed.”

12. And if the document is given to one who does not ⌞know how to read⌟,Literally “know a document” saying, “⌞Read⌟Literally “Call” this now!” he says, “I do not ⌞know how to read⌟.”Literally “know a document” 

13. And the Lord said,  “Because this people draw near with its mouth, and with its lips it honors me, and its heart is far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men that has been taught,  

14. therefore look, I am again doing something spectacular  and a spectacle with this spectacular people. And the wisdom of its wise men shall perish, and the discernment of its discerning ones shall keep itself hidden.” 

15. Ah! Those who make a plan deep, to hide it from Yahweh, and their deeds areThe Hebrew is singular in a dark place. And they say, “Who sees us? And who knows us?” 

16. Your perversity! As if ⌞a potter⌟Literally “of the one who creates” shall be regarded as the clay! That the product of its maker says, “He did not make me,” and the thing made into shape says of its ⌞potter⌟,Literally “one who creates” “He has no understanding.”   

17.  Blessing after Punishment  ⌞In a very little while⌟Literally “Not still a trifling of time” shall not Lebanon change into a fruitful land, and the fruitful land be regarded as a forest? 

18. And on that day, the deaf shall hear the words of a scroll, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of gloom and darkness. 

19. And the meek ⌞have joy after joy⌟Literally “shall add joy” in Yahweh, and the needy of the people shall rejoice in the holy one of Israel. 

20. For the tyrant shall be no more, and the scoffer shall come to an end. And all those lying in wait for evil shall be cut off; 

21. those who mislead a person into sin with a word and set a trap for the ⌞arbitrator⌟Literally “one who argues” in the gate and guide away the righteous by emptiness.  

22. Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says this to the house of Jacob:  “Jacob will no longer be ashamed, and his face will no longer grow pale. 

23. For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will treat my name as holy, and they will treat the holy one of Jacob as holy, and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel. 

24. And those who err in spirit will ⌞acquire⌟Literally “know” understanding, and those who grumble will learn instruction.    

## Isaiah 30

1.  Warning against Alliance with Egypt “Oh rebellious children!” ⌞declares⌟Literally “declaration of” Yahweh,  “to make a plan, butOr “and” not from me, and pour out a libation, butOr “and” not from my Spirit, ⌞so as to add⌟Literally “for the sake of adding” sin to sin. 

2. Who go to go down to Egypt, butOr “and” they do not ask of my mouth, to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt. 

3. And the protection of Pharaoh shall be shame to you, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, humiliation. 

4. For his officials are at Zoan, and his envoys reach to Hanes.  

5. Everyone will start to stink because of a people that cannot profit them,  not for help and not for profiting, but for shame and also for disgrace.”   

6.

7. ForOr “And” ⌞Egyptians⌟Literally “Egypt” help with vanity and emptiness, therefore I have called this one “Rahab, they are sitting.” 

8. Now go, write it on a tablet with them, and inscribe it on a scroll, ⌞that⌟Or “and” it may be ⌞for the time to come⌟,Literally “for last day” forever, forever. 

9. For it is a people of rebellion, deceitful children, children who are not willing to hear the instruction of Yahweh, 

10. who say to those who do see, “You must not see!” and to the seers, “You must not see truth for us; speak smooth things to us, see illusions, 

11. turn aside from the way, turn aside from the path, put an end to the holy one of Israel from our face.”  

12. Therefore the holy one of Israel says this:  “Because you are rejecting this word and you trust in oppression and ⌞cunning⌟Literally “going wrong” and you rely on it, 

13. therefore this iniquity shall come for you like a breach about to fall, bulging out on a high wall ⌞that breaks⌟Literally “whose breaking comes” suddenly, in an instant.

And he breaks it like a vessel of ⌞a potter⌟Literally “someone who forms” breaks, that is crushed; he has no compassion, and no potsherd is found among its fragmentsHebrew “fragment” ⌞to take fire⌟Literally “for the taking away of fire” from the hearth, or ⌞to skim⌟Literally “for the skimming off of” water from the cistern.”  

15. For the Lord Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, said this:  “In returning and rest you shall be saved; your strength shall be in quietness and in trust.”  ButOr “And” you were not willing,

16. and you said,  “No! For we will flee on horses!”Hebrew “horse” Therefore you shall flee! And, “We will ride on swift horses!”Hebrew “horse” Therefore your pursuers shall be swift! 

17. One thousand ⌞because of⌟Literally “from the face of” a threat of one, ⌞because⌟Literally “from the face” of a threat of five you shall flee, until you are left like a flagstaff on ⌞top⌟Literally “head” of a mountain, and like a signal on a hill.   

18.  Yahweh Will Show Mercy  Therefore Yahweh waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he will rise up to show you mercy, for Yahweh is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him. 

19. For people will live in Zion; in Jerusalem, you will surely not weep. Surely he will be gracious to you; when he hears the sound of your cry, he will answer you. 

20. And the Lord will give you the bread of distress and the water of oppression, butOr “and” your teachers will not hide themselvesHebrew “himself” any longer. And your eyes ⌞shall see⌟Literally “be seeing” your teachers. 

21. And your ears shall hear a word from behind you, saying, “this is the way; walk in it,” when you go to your right and when you go to your left.

24. and the oxen and the donkeys that tillOr “tilling” the ground will eat fodder, sorrel that has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 

25. And there will be streams on every high mountain and elevated hill, watercourses of water, on a day of great slaughter, when towers fall. 

26. And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the day when Yahweh binds up the breakage of his people, and he heals the wound of his blow.   

27.  Judgment against Assyria  Look! The name of Yahweh comes from afar, burning with his anger and heaviness of cloud. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire. 

28. And his breath is like an overflowing river; it reaches up to the neck to shake the nations with the sieve of worthlessness; and a bridle that leads astray is on the jawbones of the peoples. 

29. ⌞You shall have a song⌟Literally “There shall be a song for you” as in the night when a holy festival is kept, and a gladness of heart like one who goes with the flute, to go to the mountain of Yahweh, to the rock of Israel. 

30. And Yahweh will cause the majesty of his voice to be heard, and he will cause the descent of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst and a rainstorm and stonesHebrew “stone” of hail. 

31. Indeed, Assyria will be shattered by the voice of Yahweh; he strikes with the rod. 

32. And every stroke of the staff of foundationSome translations emend this to “discipline” that Yahweh lays will be on it with timbrels and lyres, and he will fight against itThe reading tradition (Qere) has “them” with battles of brandishing. 

33. For Topheth has been prepared from yesterday; indeed, it is made ready for the king. He makes its pile of wood deep and wide; he makes fire and wood ⌞abundant⌟.Literally “numerous” The breath of Yahweh burns in it like a stream of sulfur.    

## Isaiah 31

1.  The Egyptians are No Help Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help! They rely on horses  and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very numerous, and they do not look to the holy one of Israel, and they do not consult Yahweh. 

2. And indeed, he is wise, and he brings disaster, and he does not remove his words, and he will rise against the house of evildoers and against the help of workers of iniquity. 

3. And the Egyptians are human and not God, and their horses are flesh and not spirit. And Yahweh stretches out his hand, and the helper will stumble, and the one being helped will fall, and together all of them will come to an end.Or “perish”  

4. For Yahweh said this to me:  “As which a lion growls and a young lion over its prey  when ⌞a full group⌟Literally “fullness” of shepherds is called against him,  it is not terrified by their voice, and to their noise it does not respond, so Yahweh of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill.  

5. Like birds flying overhead, so Yahweh of hosts will protect Jerusalem;  he will protect and deliver it; he will pass over and rescue it.  

6. Turn back to the one against whom the sons of Israel have made deep rebellion.

6. Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which if a man leans on it, goes into his hand and bores through it! Such is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all those who trust in him.

7. And if you say to me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ was it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall bow down in the ⌞presence⌟Literally “face” of this altar.’ ”

7. Is it not to break your bread for the hungry? You must bring ⌞home⌟Literally “a house” the poor, the homeless. When you see the naked, you must cover him, and you must not hide yourself from your ⌞relatives⌟.Literally “flesh”

## Isaiah 59

1.  Rampant Transgression  Look! The hand of Yahweh is not too short ⌞to save⌟,Literally “from saving” and his ear is not too dull ⌞to hear⌟.Literally “from hearing” 

2. Rather, your iniquities have been ⌞barriers⌟Literally “dividers” between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, from hearing. 

3. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, your tongue speaks wickedness. 

4. There is nobody ⌞who pleads with⌟Literally “calling in” justice, and there is nobody who judges with honesty. They rely on nothing and speak vanity. They conceive trouble and beget iniquity; 

5. they hatch viper eggs, and they weave a spider web. One who eats their eggs dies, and that which is pressed is hatched as a serpent. 

6. Their webs cannot become clothing, and they cannot cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and deedsHebrew “deed” of violence are in their hands. 

7. Their feet run to evil, and they hasten to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; devastation and destruction are in their highways. 

8. They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their firm paths. They have made their paths crooked for themselves; everyone ⌞who walks⌟Literally “walking” in it knows no peace.

10. We grope like the blind along a wall, and we grope ⌞as without⌟Literally “like there are no” eyes. We stumble at noon as in the twilight; among the strong we are like the dead. 

11. We all groan like bears, and we coo mutteringly like doves. We wait for justice, butOr “and” there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us. 

12. For our transgressions are numerous before you, and our sins ⌞testify⌟Or “answers” against us. Indeed, our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities: 

13. transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning ⌞away from following⌟Literally “back from behind” our God; speaking oppression and falsehood, conceiving and uttering words of deception from the heart. 

14. And justice is pushed back, and righteousness stands afar; for truth stumbles in the public square, and straightforwardness is unable to enter, 

15. and truth is missing, and he who turns aside from evil is plundered. And Yahweh saw, and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice 

16. And he saw that there was no man, and he was appalled that there was no one who intercedes, soOr “and” his arm came to assist him, and his righteousness ⌞was what⌟Literally “it” sustained him. 

17. And he put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head, and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and he wrapped himself in zeal as in a robe. 

18. According to deeds, so he will repay; wrath to his enemies, requital to those who are his ⌞enemies⌟.Literally “hostile” He will repay requital to the coastlands.

2. For look! darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples, butOr “and” Yahweh will rise on you, and his glory will appear over you. 

3. And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the bright light of your sunrise.
