5. And when it was time to shut the gate ⌞for the night⌟,Literally “in the darkness” or “at dark” the men left, and I do not know where they went. Chase after them quickly, for you may catch up to them.”

6. (But she had taken them to the roof and had hidden them ⌞in the stalks of flax⌟Literally “in the flaxes of the plant stalk” that she ⌞had spread out⌟Literally “had been arranged” on the roof.)

7. So the men chased after them on ⌞the way to the Jordan⌟Literally “the road of the Jordan” at the fords; and they shut the gate behind the pursuers that had gone out after them. 

8. Before ⌞they went to sleep⌟,Literally “they lay down” she came up to them on the roof

9. and said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of your presence.

10. For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the waters of the ⌞Red Sea⌟Literally “sea of reeds” before you when you went out from Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

11. We heard this, and our heartsHebrew “heart” melted, and ⌞no courage was left in anyone⌟Literally “a spirit no longer stood in anyone” because of your presence. For Yahweh your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.

15. Then she lowered them with a rope through the window, as her house was on the outer side of the wall, and she was residing in the wall.

16. And she said to them, “Go to the mountain, so that the pursuers will not find you, and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers return, and afterward you may go ⌞on your way⌟.”Literally “to your way”

17. The men said to her, “We will be released from this oath of yours that you made us swear.

18. When we come to the land, you must tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you must gather your father and mother, and your brothers, and your whole family to your house.

19. If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, ⌞they will be responsible for their own death⌟,Literally “his blood will be on his head” and we will be innocent.

20. But if you report this business of ours, we will be released from your oath that you made us swear.”

22. They departed and came to the mountain, and they stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers searched ⌞all along the way⌟Literally “on all of the road” but did not find them.

23. The two men returned and went down from the mountain, and they crossed over and came to Joshua son of Nun, and they told him everything that happened to them.

2. At the end of the three days the officers passed through the midst of the camp,

3. and they commanded the people: “When you see the Levitical priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God you must set out from your place and go after it.

4. But there will be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits in measurement.That is, about 1 km Do not come near it, so that you may know the way that you must go, for you have not passed on this way ⌞before⌟.”Literally “from yesterday three days before”

7. Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “This day I will begin exalting you ⌞in the sight⌟Literally “in the eyes” of all Israel, that they may know that I was with Moses, and I will be with you.

8. You will command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘At the moment that you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you will stand still in the Jordan.’ ”

9. And Joshua said to the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”

10. Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is in your midst, and he will certainly drive out the Canaanites ⌞from before you⌟,Or “from your presence” and the Hittites, Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

11. Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earthOr “world” is about to cross over ahead of you into the Jordan.

12. So then, take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, ⌞one from each tribe⌟.Literally “one man for the tribe”

14. And it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were ⌞ahead of the people⌟.Literally “before the presence of the people”

15. When those carrying the ark came up to the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet in the edge of the water (the Jordan was flowing over its banks during all the days of harvest),

16. the waters flowing down from above stood still; they stood up in one heap very far from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,That is, the Dead Sea ⌞were completely cut off⌟;Literally “they were completed they were cut off” and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.

17. And the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firmly on the dry land in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation finished crossing the Jordan.

4. So Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” one from each tribe.

5. And Joshua said to them, “Cross over beforeOr “the presence” the ark of Yahweh your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each one of you lift up a stone on yourHebrew “his” shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel”

6. so that this may be a reminderOr “sign” among you. When your children ask in the future, saying, ‘⌞What do these stones mean to you⌟?’Literally “What are these stones for you?”

7. you will say to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off ⌞from before⌟Or “the presence of” the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will be as a memorial for the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” for eternity.” 

8. Thus the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” did as Joshua commanded. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan as Yahweh told Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and they carried them over with them to ⌞the camp⌟,Literally “the place of overnight lodging” and they put them there.

9. Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood, and they are there to this day.

10. The priests carrying the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Yahweh commanded Joshua to tell the people was finished, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastily crossed over. 

11. And it happened, when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed over in front ofOr “before the presence” the people.

12. The children of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” as Moses told them.

13. About forty thousand armed for fighting crossed over before the presence of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle.

14. On that day Yahweh exalted Joshua ⌞in the sight⌟Literally “in the eyes” of all Israel, and they respected himOr “feared him” as they respectedOr “feared” Moses all the days of his life. 

15. Then Yahweh said to Joshua, saying,

16. “Command the priests carrying the ark of the testimonyThat is, the ark of the covenant ⌞to come up⌟Literally “and let them come up” from the Jordan.”

17. So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”

18. And it happened that when the priests carrying the ark came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet ⌞touched dry land⌟,Literally “were raised from the ground to dry land” the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before. 

19. And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the eastern edgeThat is, border of Jericho.

20. And those twelve stones that they took from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.

21. And he said to the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” “When your children ask in the future ⌞their parents⌟,Literally “their fathers” ‘⌞What is the meaning of these stones⌟?’Literally “What are these stones?”

22. you will let your children know by saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’

23. For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you had crossed, just as Yahweh your God did to the ⌞Red Sea⌟,Literally “sea of reeds” which he dried up before us until we had crossed over,

24. so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is strong, so that you may fear Yahweh your God ⌞forever⌟.”Literally “all the days”   

## Joshua 5

1.  The Israelites Are Circumcised And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the CanaanitesHebrew “Canaanite” who were by the sea heard that Yahweh dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” until they crossed over, their hearts melted, and ⌞there was no courage left in them⌟Literally “a spirit was no longer in them” because of the presence of the ⌞Israelites⌟. Literally “sons/children of Israel” 

2. At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” a second time.”

3. So Joshua made knives of flint, and he circumcised the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” at the hill of the foreskins.Hebrew “Gibeath-haaraloth”

4. This is the reason why Joshua circumcised all the people: all the males who went out from Egypt, all the warriors, died in the wilderness as they went out from Egypt ⌞on the journey⌟.Literally “on the road”

5. For all the people who left were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness ⌞on the journey⌟Literally “on the road” after they left from Egypt were not circumcised.

6. For forty years the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” traveled in the wilderness until all the nation, the warriors that left Egypt, perished, because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. To them Yahweh swore that they would not see the land that heHebrew “Yahweh” swore to their ancestorsOr “fathers” to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

7. And it was their children whom he raised in their place that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised ⌞on the journey⌟.Literally “on the road”  

8.  The Israelites Celebrate Passover in Canaan And it happened, when all the nation had finished circumcising, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered.

9. And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” Therefore, the name of that place is called GilgalHebrew “rolling” to this day.

10. And the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” camped at Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho.

11. On the next day after the Passover, on thatLiterally “this” very day, they ate from the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted corn.

12. And the manna ceased the day after, when they started eating the produce of the land, and there was no longer manna for the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel” They ate from the crop of the land of Canaan in that year.  

13.  The Commander of Yahweh’s Army Appears Before Joshua And it happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, ⌞he looked up⌟,Literally “he lifted up his eyes” and he saw a man standing ⌞opposite him⌟Literally “against him” with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said, “Are you with us, or with our adversaries?”

14. And he said, “Neither. I have come now as the commander of Yahweh’s army.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and ⌞he bowed down⌟Or “he worshiped” and said to him, “What is my lord commanding his servant?”

15. The commander of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandalsHebrew “sandal” from your feet,Hebrew “foot” for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.   

## Joshua 6

1.  The Battle of Jericho Now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the presence of the ⌞Israelites⌟;Literally “sons/children of Israel” no one was going out or coming in.

2. And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Look, I am giving Jericho into your hand, its king and the soldiers of the army.

3. You will march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once; you will do so for six days.

4. And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you will march around the city seven times, and the priests will blow on the trumpets.

5. And when they blow long on the horn of the ram, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout with a great war cry, and the wall of the city will fall flat,Or “in its place” and ⌞the people will charge, each one straight ahead⌟.”Literally “the people will go up, each before him”

6. So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry the trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh.”

7. And he saidHebrew “they said” to the people, “Go forward and march around the city, and let the armed men pass before the ark of Yahweh. 

8. ⌞And when Joshua spoke⌟Literally “And it happened the moment of the saying of Joshua” to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the presence of Yahweh went forward and they blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed behind them.

9. And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they were blowing the trumpets.

10. But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You will not shout, and you will not let your voice be heard; a word will not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you ‘Shout!’ Then you will shout.”

11. And the ark of Yahweh went around the city, ⌞circling once⌟,Literally “circling one occurrence” and they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.

12. Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.

13. The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and they blew on the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh, while the trumpets blew continually.

14. And they marched around the city once on the second day, and they returned to the camp. They did this for six days. 

15. Then on the seventh day they rose early at dawn, and they marched around the city in this manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.

16. And at the seventh time the priests blew on the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city.

17. The city and all that is in it will be devoted to Yahweh; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in the house will live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.

18. As for you, keep away from the thingsHebrew “thing” devoted to destruction so that you do not take them and bring about your own destruction, making the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it.

19. But all of the silver and gold, and the items of bronze and iron, are holy to Yahweh, and they must go to Yahweh’s treasury.”

20. So the people shouted, and theyThat is, the priests blew on the trumpets. And when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell flat. ⌞The people charged, each one straight ahead into the city⌟,Literally “The people went up, each before him” and they captured it.

21. And they utterly destroyed ⌞by the edge of the sword⌟Literally “by the mouth of the sword” all who were in the city, both men and women, young and old, ox, sheep, and donkey. 

22. Then Joshua said to the two men who spied on the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.”

23. So the young men who were spies went and brought Rahab and her father and mother, her brothers, and all who were with her. And they brought all her family out and set them outside the camp of Israel.

24. And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire; they put only the silver and gold, and the items of copper and iron, into the treasury of the house of Yahweh.

25. But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute ⌞and her family⌟Literally “and the house of her father” and all who were with her, and she has lived in the midst of Israel until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 

26. And Joshua swore at that time, saying, “Cursed is anyone before Yahweh who gets up and builds Jericho, this city. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”

27. So Yahweh was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.   

## Joshua 7

1.  The Sin of Achan But the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” broke faith concerning the devoted things.Or “consecrated possessions” Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from the devoted things;Hebrew “thing” or “consecrated possession” and ⌞Yahweh’s anger was kindled⌟Literally “the nose of Yahweh became hot” against the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel” 

2. Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel, and he said to them, “Go up and spy out Ai.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.

3. And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up and attack Ai; only two or three thousand men should go up because theyThat is, the people of Ai are few. Do not make all the people weary up there.”

4. So about three thousand from the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.

5. The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and they chased them from the gate up to Shebarim and killed them on the slope. And the heartsHebrew “heart” of the people melted and became like water. 

6. And Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.Hebrew “head”

7. And Joshua said, “Ah, my Lord! Why did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content and stayed beyond the Jordan.

8. Please, my Lord! What can I say after ⌞Israel has fled from its enemies⌟?Literally “Israel has turned its neck before its enemies”

9. The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the land. What will you do, for your great name?” 

10. And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stand up! ⌞Why⌟Literally “For what this” have you fallen on your face?

11. Israel has sinned and ⌞transgressed my covenant⌟Literally “crossed my covenant” that I commanded them. They have taken from the devoted things;Hebrew “thing” or “from the consecrated possession” they have stolen and acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their belongings.

12. The ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” were unable to stand before their enemies; ⌞they fled from their enemies⌟Literally “they turned their neck before their enemies” because they have become a thing devotedOr “consecrated” for destruction. ⌞I will be with you no more⌟Literally “I will not do again to be with you” unless you destroy the devoted thingsHebrew “thing” or “consecrated possession” from among you.

13. Get up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “There are devoted thingsHebrew “thing” or “consecrated possession” in your midst, O Israel. You will be unable to stand before you enemies until you remove the devoted thingsHebrew “thing” or “consecrated possession” from your midst.”

14. In the morning you will come forward, ⌞tribe by tribe⌟,Literally “according to your tribes” and the tribe that Yahweh will select by lot will come forward by clans, and the clan that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward by families, and the family that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward one by one.

15. The one caught with the devoted thingsHebrew “thing” or “consecrated possession” will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because ⌞he transgressed the covenant⌟Literally “he crossed the covenant” of Yahweh, and because he did a disgraceful thing in Israel.” ’ ” 

16. SoOr “And” Joshua rose early in the morning and brought forward Israel, ⌞tribe by tribe⌟,Literally “according to its tribes” and the tribe of Judah was selected by lot.

17. And he brought forward the clans of Judah and selected the clan of the ZerahitesHebrew “Zerahite” by lot. Then he brought forward the clan of the Zerahites,Hebrew “Zerahite” one by one, and Zabdi was selected by lot.

18. He brought forward his family, one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected by lot.

19. And Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please, give glory to Yahweh the God of Israel, and give him a doxology in court.Some interpret “make a confession” Tell me, please, what you have done; do not hide it from me.”

20. And Achan answered Joshua and said, “It is true. I have sinned against Yahweh the God of Israel, and this is what I did:

21. I saw among the spoil a beautiful robe from Shinar,“Shinar” refers to Babylonia two hundred shekels of silver, and one bar of gold that weighed fifty shekels; I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, and the silver is under it.” 

22. Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there they were, hidden in his tent, and the silver was under it.

23. And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel” And they spread them out before the presence of Yahweh.

24. Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle and donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that was his, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.Hebrew “trouble”; a valley in the Jericho region

25. And Joshua said, “Why did you bring us trouble? Yahweh will bring you trouble on this day.” And all Israel stoned themHebrew “him” with stones;Hebrew “stone” and they burned them with fire after they stoned them with stones.

26. Then ⌞they placed⌟Literally “they raised up” on top of him a great pile of stones that remains to this day. And Yahweh ⌞turned from his burning anger⌟,Literally “turned from his burning nose” and thus the name of that place to this day is called the valley of Achor.Hebrew “trouble”; a valley in the Jericho region

2. You will do to Ai and its king that which you did to Jericho and its king; you may take only its spoilsHebrew “spoil” and livestock as booty for yourself. Set for yourself an ambush against the city from behind it.” 

3. So Joshua and ⌞all the fighting men⌟Literally “all the people of war” went up immediately to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand of the best fighting men and sent them by night.

4. And he commanded them, saying, “Look, you are to lay an ambush against the city from behind. Do not go very far from the city and be ready.

5. Then I and all of the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they go out to meet us ⌞as before⌟,Literally “as that at the first occasion” we will flee from them.Or “before their presence”

6. They will come out after us until we draw them away from the city, because they will think, ‘They are fleeing from usOr “before our presence” ⌞as before⌟.’Literally “as that at the first occasion” So we will flee from them.Or “before their presence”

7. Then you will rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city, for Yahweh your God will give it into your hand.

8. And when you capture the city you will set it on fire as Yahweh commanded. Look, I have commanded you.”

9. So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of the ambush, and they sat between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent the night ⌞with the people⌟.Literally “in the middle of the people” 

10. Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people of Ai.Or “before the presence of the people of Ai”

11. ⌞All the fighting men⌟Literally “All the people of war” who were with him ⌞went up and drew near before the city⌟Literally “went up, drew near, and came before the city” and camped north of Ai; there was a valley between him and Ai.

12. And he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.

13. So they stationed the forces; all the army was north of the city while ⌞the rear guard was west⌟.Literally “while its rear guard was west of the city” But Joshua went that night to the middle of the valley.

14. When the king of Ai saw this, the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out to meet Israel for battle—heThat is, the king and all his army—to the meeting place before the Arabah.A dry region that runs south of the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan Valley He did not know that there was an ambush for him behind the city.

15. Then Joshua and all Israel acted like they were beaten before them, and they fled ⌞in the direction of the wilderness⌟.Literally “the way of the wilderness”

16. All of the people who were in the city were called to pursue after them. As they pursued after Joshua, they were drawn away from the city.

17. Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel; they left the city open and pursued after Israel. 

18. And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the swordOr “spear” that is in your hand to Ai, because I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out the sword that was in his hand to the city.

19. The moment he stretched out his hand, those in the ambush stood up quickly from their place and ran. And they went into the city and captured it, quickly setting the city ablaze with fire.

20. Then the men of Ai looked behind them, and they saw smoke from the city rising to the sky; ⌞they had no power to flee this way or that⌟,Literally “it was not in their hands to flee here and here” and the people fleeing the wilderness turned around to the pursuers.Hebrew “pursuer”

21. And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was rising; they returned and struck down the men of Ai.

22. Then the others from the city came out to meet them, ⌞and they found themselves surrounded by Israel⌟,Literally “they were in the middle of Israel” ⌞some on one side, and others on the other side⌟.Literally “these from these, and these from this” And theyThat is, Israel struck them down until no survivor or fugitive was left.

23. But they captured the king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua. 

24. When Israel finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when all of them had fallen by ⌞the edge of the sword⌟Literally “the mouth of the sword” until they all had perished, all Israel returned to Ai and attacked it with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟.Literally “the mouth of the sword”

25. All the people that fell on that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the inhabitants of Ai.

26. For Joshua did not draw back his hand that was stretched out with the sword until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

27. Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of Yahweh that Joshua commanded.

28. So Joshua burned Ai and made it an everlasting heap of rubbish, a desolate place until this day.

29. The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the time of evening, and as the sun went down Joshua commanded them, and they brought down his dead body from the tree. Then they threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and they raised over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day.  

30.  Israel Renews the Covenant Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal for Yahweh the God of Israel,

31. as Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses: “an altar of unhewnOr “whole” stones on which no one has ⌞wielded⌟Literally “waved over them” an iron implement.”See Exod 20:25 And they offered burnt offerings on it and sacrificed fellowship offerings.

32. And there Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which heThat is, Moses had written, in the presence of the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

33. Then all Israel, ⌞foreigner as well as native⌟,Literally “as the alien as the native” with the elders, officials, and judges stood ⌞on either side⌟Literally “from this and from this” of the ark before the priests and the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim, and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses Yahweh’s servant had commanded before to bless the people of Israel.

34. And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessingsHebrew “blessing” and the curses,Hebrew “curse” according to all that was written in the scroll of the law.

35. There was not a word from all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before the assembly of all Israel, and the women, the little children, and the traveling foreignersHebrew “foreigner” among them.   

## Joshua 9

1.  The Gibeonites Act with Cunning NowOr “And it happened” when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the Shephelah,Or “lowlands”; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea and on all the coast of the great sea toward LebanonLiterally “white mountain”—the Hittites,Hebrew “Hittite” the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” the Canaanites,Hebrew “Canaanite” the Perizzites,Hebrew “Perizzite” the Hivites,Hebrew “Hivite” and the JebusitesHebrew “Jebusite”—heard of this,

2. they gathered themselves together to fight with one accord againstHebrew “with” Joshua and Israel. 

3. But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and Ai,

4. and they acted on their part with cunning: they went and prepared provisions,The Hebrew is difficult here. Some ancient manuscripts read, “they sent out a delegation/an envoy” and took worn-out sacksOr “sackcloths” for their donkeys and old wineskins that were torn and mended.

5. The sandals on their feet were patched and old, their clothes were old, and their food was dry and crumbled.

6. And they went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far land; so then ⌞make a covenant with us⌟.”Literally “cut for us a covenant”

7. And the men of Israel said to the Hivites,Hebrew “Hivite” “Perhaps you are living among us; how can we ⌞make a covenant⌟Literally “cut a covenant” with you?”

8. They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and from where do you come?”

9. And they said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far land because of the name of Yahweh your God; we have heard of his reputation, of all that he did in Egypt,

10. and of all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.

11. So our elders said to us and all the inhabitants of our land, ‘Take in your hand provisions for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; so then ⌞make a covenant with us⌟.” ’Literally “cut for us a covenant”

12. This is our bread; it was hot when we took it from our houses as provisions on the day we set out to come to you. But now, look, it is dry and crumbled.

13. These are the wineskins that we filled new, but look, they have burst; and these are our clothes and sandals that have worn out from the very long journey.”

14. So the leadersOr “men” took from their provisions, but ⌞they did not ask direction from Yahweh⌟.Literally “the mouth of Yahweh they did not ask”

15. And Joshua made peace with them, and ⌞he made a covenant with them⌟Literally “he cut a covenant with them” to allow them to live happily, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them. 

16. And it happened that at the end of three days, after they made a covenant with them, they heard that ⌞they were their neighbors⌟Literally “they were near them” and living among them.

17. And the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” set out and went to their cities on the third day (their cities were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim).

18. But the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured ⌞against their leaders⌟.Literally “against the leaders of the congregation”

19. But all the leaders of the congregation said, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel, and so we cannot touch them.

20. This we will do to them: we will let them live so that wrath will not be on us because of the oath we swore to them.”

21. And the leadersOr “men” said to them, “Let them live.” So they became woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said to them. 

22. And Joshua summoned them and said, “Why have you deceived us saying, ‘We are very far from you’ when you are living among us?

23. Therefore you are cursed; some of you will always be slaves as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”

24. And they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was told with certainty to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, so we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and so we did this thing.

25. So then, look, we are in your hand; do with us whatever seems good and right in your eyes.”

26. So he did this to them: he saved them from the hand of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and they did not kill them.

27. And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place that he should choose.   

## Joshua 10

1.  The Sun Stands Still at Gibeon And it happened that when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua captured Ai and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he did to Ai and its king) and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,

2. heHebrew “they” became very afraid because Gibeon was a very large city, ⌞like one of the royal cities⌟,Literally “like one of the cities of the kingship” and because it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty warriors.

3. So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hohman king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,

4. “Come up and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, because it has made peace with Joshua and the ⌞Israelites⌟.”Literally “sons/children of Israel”

5. And the five kings of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their forces, and ⌞they laid siege to Gibeon⌟Literally “they camped against Gibeon”; see Josh 10:31 and made war against it. 

6. And the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “⌞Do not abandon⌟Literally “do not release your hands from” your servant. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, for all the kings of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” who dwell in the hill country have gathered against us.”

7. So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and ⌞all the fighting men⌟Literally “all the people of the war” with him, ⌞all the best warriors⌟.Literally “all the mighty warriors of the army”

8. And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hand; ⌞no one will withstand you⌟.Literally “not a man of them will stand in your presence”

9. Joshua came upon them suddenly ⌞by marching up⌟Literally “he went up” all night from Gilgal.

10. And Yahweh threw them into panic before Israel, whoHebrew “he” struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.

11. And as they were fleeing from Israel, they were on the slope of Beth-horon, and Yahweh threw huge stones from the heavens on them as far as Azekah; and more died by the hail stones than those whom the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” killed by the sword. 

12. Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh, on the day Yahweh gave the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” over to the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and he said in the sight of Israel,  “Sun in Gibeon, stand still, and moon, in the valley of Aijalon.” 

13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on its enemies.  Is it not written in the scroll of Jashar? The sun stood still in the middle of the heaven and was not in haste to set for about a full day.

14. There has not been a day like this before it or after, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel.

15. And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal.  

16.  The Kings of the Amorites Are Killed But these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.

17. And it was told to Joshua, saying, “The five kings were found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”

18. And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men in front of it to guard them.

19. But do not stay there; pursue after your enemies and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to go into their cities, for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand.”

20. When Joshua and the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” had finished striking them with a very great blow, until they perished, ⌞those of them who survived⌟Literally “the survivors who survived” went into the fortified cities,

21. and all the people returned to the camp safelyOr “in peace” to Joshua at Makkedah. ⌞No one spoke⌟Literally “No one moved his tongue” against the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel” 

22. And Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring to me those five kings from the cave.”

23. And they did so, and brought him these five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

24. And when they brought these kings to Joshua, Joshua called all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of ⌞the fighting men⌟Literally “the men of war” who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks.

25. And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed! Be strong and bold, for thus Yahweh will do to all your enemies whom you are about to fight.

26. And after this Joshua struck them down and killed them, and he hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until the evening.

27. And it happened ⌞at the time of sunset⌟,Literally “at the time of the going of the sun” Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they put large stones against the mouth of the cave, which are there to this very day. 

28. Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and he struck it and its king with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟;Literally “the mouth of the sword” he utterly destroyed it and everyone that was in it. He did not leave behind a survivor. So he did to the king of Makkedah just as he did to the king of Jericho.  

29.  Joshua’s Conquest of the South And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah, and he fought against Libnah.

30. And Yahweh also gave it into the hand of Israel, and its king and all the people in it he struck with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟.Literally “the mouth of the sword” He left in it no survivor. He did to its king just as he did to the king of Jericho. 

31. And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and ⌞he laid siege to it⌟Literally “he camped opposite it” and fought against it.

32. And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day. He struck it with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟,Literally “the mouth of the sword” and everyone in it, just as he did to Libnah. 

33. Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people until he left no survivor behind. 

34. And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon, and ⌞they laid siege to it⌟Literally “they camped opposite it” and fought against it.

35. And they captured it on that day, and he struck it with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟,Literally “the mouth of the sword” and all the people that were in it on that day he utterly destroyed as he had done to Lachish. 

36. And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it

37. and captured it, and they struck it with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟,Literally “the mouth of the sword” its king and all its cities, and all the people that were in it; he left behind no survivor, as he had done to Eglon, and he utterly destroyed it and all the people that were in it.

38. Then Joshua returned to Debir, and all of Israel with him, and they fought against it,

39. and he captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with ⌞the the edge of the sword⌟,Literally “the mouth of the sword” and they utterly destroyed all the people that were in it; he left behind no survivor, just as he had done to Hebron. Thus he did to Debir and its king what he had done to Libnah and its king. 

40. So Joshua struck all the land—the hill country, the Negev,An arid region south of the Judaean hills the Shephelah,Or “lowlands”; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea and the slopesThe slopes of the hills of the western Jordan to the Dead Sea region—and all their kings; he left behind no survivor, and ⌞all that breathed⌟Literally “all of the breath” he utterly destroyed as Yahweh the God of Israel commanded.

41. Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen up to Gibeon;

42. all of these kings and their land Joshua captured at one time, because Yahweh the God of Israel fought for Israel.

43. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.   

## Joshua 11

1.  Joshua’s Conquest of the North And it happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Acshaph,

2. and to the kings who were in the north in the hill country, in the ArabahA dry region that runs south of the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan valley south of Kinnereth,That is, the Sea of Galilee in the Shephelah,Or “lowlands”; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea and in Naphoth DorOr “the heights of Dor” in the west,

4. They came out, they and all their armies with them, as a great army like the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.

5. And all these kings joined forces, and they came and camped together by the waters of Merom to fight with Israel. 

6. And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of their presence, for tomorrow at this time I will hand them over slain to Israel; you will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”

7. So Joshua, and ⌞all the fighting men⌟Literally “all the people of war” with him, came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and ⌞they attacked them⌟.Literally “they fell upon them”

8. And Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them and pursued them up to Great Sidon and Misrephoth Maim, and eastward up to the valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until they left behind no survivor.

9. And Joshua did to them as Yahweh commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire. 

10. Then Joshua turned back at that time, and he captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, because Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms.

11. He struck all the people that were in it with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟,Literally “the mouth of the sword” utterly destroying them. ⌞There was no one left who breathed⌟,Literally “No one was left over of any breath” and he burned Hazor with fire.

12. And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he utterly destroyed them with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟,Literally “the mouth of the sword” as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.

13. Israel did not burn the cities standing on their mounds,Hebrew “mound” except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned.

14. And all the spoil and livestock of these cities the ⌞Israelites⌟ took as booty; they struck the people with ⌞the edge of the sword⌟,Literally “the mouth of the sword” until they had destroyed them—they left behind no one who breathed.

15. Just as Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did; he left nothing undone that Yahweh had commanded Moses.  

16.  A Review of Joshua’s Conquests So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev,An arid region south of the Judaean hills all the land of Goshen,A southern region; the name means “on the mountains” the Shephelah,Or “lowlands”; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea the Arabah,A dry region that runs south of the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan valley and the hill country of Israel and its Shephelah,Or “lowlands”; a geographical region on the western edge of the hills of Judea

17. from Mount Halak that rises to Seir and to Baal Gad in the valley of LebanonOr “white mountain” ⌞at the foot of⌟Literally “under” Mount Hermon; he captured all their kings, struck them, and killed them.

18. For many days Joshua made war with all these kings.

20. For it was Yahweh that ⌞hardened their hearts⌟,Literally “made their hearts strong” to meet Israel in war in order to utterly destroy them without mercy, that they would destroy them just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 

21. At that time Joshua came and exterminated the Anakites from the hill country, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.

22. None of the Anakites were left in the land of the ⌞Israelites⌟;Literally “sons/children of Israel” some remained only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.

2. Their inheritance was by lot, just as Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.

9. And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land that your foot has trodden on will be an inheritance to you and your sons forever, because you remained true to Yahweh my God.’

10. So then, look, Yahweh has kept me alive just as he promised these forty-five years,Hebrew “year” from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses while Israel ⌞wandered⌟Literally “went” in the wilderness. Now look, today ⌞I am eighty-five years old⌟.Literally “I am a son of eighty-five years”

12. So now give me this hill country that Yahweh spoke of on that day, for you heard on that day that the Anakites were there, with great and fortified cities. Perhaps Yahweh is with me, and I will drive them out just as Yahweh promised.”Or “said” 

13. And Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.

## Joshua 22

1.  The Eastern Tribes Return Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

2. and he said to them, “You have observed all that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, and you have listenedOr “you have obeyed” to my voice in all that I have commanded you;

3. you have not forsaken your kinsmenOr “brothers” these many days, up to this day, and you have observed the obligation of the command of Yahweh your God.

4. So then, Yahweh your God has given rest to your kinsmen,Or “brothers” just as he promised them; so then, turn and go to your tents to the land of your possession, which Moses Yahweh’s servant gave to you beyond the Jordan.

5. Only be very careful to observe the commandment and law that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.”Or “inner self”

6. And Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.

7. And to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession with their kinsmenOr “brothers” beyond the Jordan to the west; and when Joshua sent them to their tents and blessed them,

8. he said to them, “Return to your tents with much wealth, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, copper, iron, and with very much clothing; divide the war-booty of your enemies with your kinsmen.”Or “brothers”

9. So the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed with the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead to the land of their possession, which they had acquired ⌞according to the command of Yahweh⌟Literally “on the mouth of Yahweh” through the hand of Moses. 

10. And they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, and the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar on the Jordan, ⌞a large and imposing altar⌟.Literally “a large altar to appearance”

11. And the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” heard it said that the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar next to the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

12. When the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” heard of it, the whole congregation of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” gathered at Shiloh to go up against them for battle.

13. And the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” sent to the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, Phinehas the priest son of Eleazar,

14. and ten leaders with him, ⌞one leader for each⌟Literally “one leader, one leader” ⌞family⌟Literally “of the house of father” from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one was the head of ⌞his family⌟Literally “house of their fathers” among the clans of Israel.Or “thousands of Israel”

15. They came to the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,

16. “Thus says all the congregation of Yahweh: ‘What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Israel by turning away today from following Yahweh, by building for yourselves an altar to rebel today against Yahweh?

17. Is not the sin of Peor ⌞enough for us⌟,Literally “too little for us” from which we have not cleansed ourselves today, and for which a plague came to the congregation of Yahweh,

18. that you must turn today from following Yahweh? If you rebel today against Yahweh, tomorrow he will be angry with all of the congregation of Israel;

19. if, however, the land of your property is unclean, cross over to the land of Yahweh’s property, where Yahweh’s tabernacle resides,Or “stands” and take possession among us. But you must not rebel against Yahweh or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God.

20. Did not Achan son of Zerah commit treachery with devoted things,Or “consecrated possession” and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? ⌞And he alone⌟Literally “And he is one man that” did not perish because of his iniquity.’ ” 

21. And the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh spoke with the heads of the clansOr “thousands” of Israel,

22. “Yahweh, God of gods! Yahweh, God of gods knows. And let Israel itself know, if it was in rebellion or treachery against Yahweh, do not spare us this day

23. for building for ourselves an altar to turn away from Yahweh, or if it was to offer burnt offerings,Hebrew “offering” grain offerings,Hebrew “offering” or fellowship offerings on it, may Yahweh himself take vengeance.

24. But in fact, we have done this because of anxiety, because of a reason, saying, ‘In the future your children may say to our children, ‘⌞What is the relationship between you and Yahweh the God of Israel⌟?Literally “What is to you and to Yahweh the God of Israel”

25. Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben and Gad; you have no portion in Yahweh.’ So your children may put an end to our children worshipingOr “seeing” Yahweh.

26. So we said, ‘Let us build immediately for ourselves an altar, not for burnt offeringsHebrew “offering” or for sacrifices;Hebrew “sacrifice”

27. instead, it is a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us for performing the serving of Yahweh in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings; so that your children may not say in the future to our children, “You have no portion in Yahweh.” ’

28. And we thought, if they say to us and to our children in the future, we can say, ‘Look at this replica of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestorsOr “fathers” made, not for burnt offeringsHebrew “offering” or sacrifices;Hebrew “sacrifice” rather, it is a witness between us and you.’

29. Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh, to turn today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offerings,Hebrew “offering” grain offerings,Hebrew “offering” or sacrifices,Hebrew “sacrifice” instead of the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.” 

30. Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the clansOr “thousands” of Israel who were with him heard the words that the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh spoke, and ⌞they were satisfied⌟.Literally “it was good in their eyes”

31. Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, said to the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Yahweh. Therefore you have rescued the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” from the hand of Yahweh.” 

32. And Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, and the leaders returned from the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan to the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and ⌞they gave them their report⌟.Literally “they brought back a word to them”

33. ⌞The report satisfied the Israelites⌟;Literally “The report was good in the eyes of the children of Israel” they blessed God, and they did not speak of going up for battle against them to destroy the land in which the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben and Gad were living.Or “dwelling”

34. The descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben and Gad called the altar Witness, “Because,” they said, “it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.”

5. And Yahweh your God will push them ⌞back before you⌟Literally “from your presence” and drive them ⌞out of your sight⌟,Literally “from your face” and you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God promised to you.

6. Be very strong to observe carefully all that is written in the scroll of the law of Moses so as not to turn aside from it, to the right or left,

7. so as not to go among these remaining nations with you; ⌞do not profess⌟Literally “do not mention” the name of their gods, and do not swear by them, serve them, or ⌞bow down to them⌟.Literally “bow yourselves down to them”

8. But hold fast to Yahweh your God, just as you have done up to this day.

9. Yahweh has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, ⌞nobody has withstood⌟Literally “a man has not stood in your presence” you to this day.

10. One of your men put to flight a thousand, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you, just as he promised you.

11. Take utmost care for the sake of your life to love Yahweh your God,

12. for if indeed you turn back and join these remaining nations ⌞among you⌟,Literally “with you” and you intermarry with them, ⌞marrying their women and they yours⌟,Literally “you go into them and they into you”

13. know for certain that Yahweh your God ⌞will not continue to drive out⌟Literally “will not drive out again” these nations from before you; they will be for you a snare and a trap, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you. 

14. Look! ⌞I am about to die⌟,Literally “I am going today on the way of all the earth” and you know in all your heartsHebrew “heart” and soulsHebrew “soul”; or “inner self” that not one thing ⌞failed⌟Literally “fell” from all the good things that Yahweh your God promised concerning you; everything ⌞has been fulfilled⌟;Literally “has come out” ⌞not one thing failed⌟.Literally “not one thing fell from it”

15. But just as all the good thingsHebrew “thing” came to you that Yahweh your God promised, so will Yahweh bring to you all the bad thingsHebrew “things” until he has destroyed you from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you.

16. If you transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded to you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, ⌞Yahweh’s anger will be kindled⌟Literally “Yahweh’s nose will become hot” against you, and you will perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you.”   

## Joshua 24

1.  Joshua Recounts Their History And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem; he summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials, and they presented themselves before God.

2. And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘⌞Long ago⌟Literally “from ancient” your ancestorsOr “fathers”—Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor—lived beyond the river,That is, the Euphrates and they served other gods.

3. I took your ancestorOr “father” Abraham from beyond the riverThat is, the Euphrates and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I increased his offspring; I gave him Isaac,

4. and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.

5. And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out.

6. When I brought out your ancestorsOr “fathers” from Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your ancestorsOr “fathers” with chariotsHebrew “chariot” and horsemen to the ⌞Red Sea⌟.Literally “sea of reed”

7. They cried out to Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over themThat is, the Egyptians and covered them; your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for many days.

8. And I brought you to the land of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” who lived beyond the Jordan; they fought you, and I gave them into your hand; you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them ⌞before you⌟.Literally “in your presence”

9. Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, set out and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you,

10. but I was not willing to listen to Balaam, and he richly blessed you. So I rescued you from his hand,

11. and you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” the Perizzites,Hebrew “Perizzite” the Canaanites,Hebrew “Canaanite” the Hittites,Hebrew “Hittite” the Girgashites,Hebrew “Girgashite” the Hivites,Hebrew “Hivite” and the Jebusites,Hebrew “Jebusite” fought against you, and I gave them into your hand.

12. I sent before you the hornet and they drove out before you two kings of the Amorites;Hebrew “Amorite” but not by your sword or bow.

13. I gave to you a land that you have not labored on, and cities that you have not built, and you liveOr “dwell” in them; you eat from vineyards and olive groves that you have not planted.’  

14.  The Israelites Promise to Serve Yahweh “So now, revere Yahweh and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness; remove the gods that your ancestorsOr “fathers” served beyond the riverThat is, the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh.

15. But if it is bad in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you want to serve, whether it is the gods that your ancestorsOr “fathers” served beyond the river,That is, the Euphrates or the gods of the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve Yahweh.”

16. And the people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we would forsake Yahweh to serve other gods,

17. for Yahweh our God brought us and our ancestorsOr “fathers” from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and did these great signs before our eyes. He protected us along the entire way that we went, and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed.

18. And Yahweh drove out all the people before us, the Amorites“Hebrew “Amorite” who liveOr “dwell” in the land. We will serve Yahweh, for he is our God.” 

19. But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve Yahweh, for he is a holy and jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.

20. If you forsake Yahweh and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster to you; he will destroy you after he has done good to you.”

21. And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve Yahweh.”

22. And Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves to serve Yahweh.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”

23. He said, “Remove the foreign gods that are in your midst, and incline your hearts to Yahweh the God of Israel.”

24. And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.”

25. So Joshua ⌞made a covenant⌟Literally “cut a covenant” with the people on that day, and he established for them a statute and a judgment at Shechem.

26. Then Joshua wrote these words in a scroll of the law of God, and he took a large stone and set it up there under a large tree, which is at the shrine of Yahweh.

27. And Joshua said to all the people, “Look, this stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of Yahweh that he spoke with us. It will be as a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God.”

28. Then Joshua sent the people away to their inheritance. 

29. After these things Joshua son of Nun servant of Yahweh died; ⌞he was one hundred and ten years old⌟.Literally “a son of one hundred and ten years”

30. They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, at Timnath-Serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

31. Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived long after Joshua, and who had known all the work that Yahweh did for Israel.Joshua 24:28–31 is repeated in Judges 2:6–10

32. The bones of Jacob, which the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” had brought out from Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in a piece of land that Jacob had bought from the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money;Hebrew kesitah it became an inheritance for the descendantsOr “sons” of Joseph.

33. And Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him in Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim, which had been given to his son Phinehas.
