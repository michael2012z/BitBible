39. And Moses spoke words to all the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and the people mourned greatly.

40. They rose early in the morning and went to the top of the mount, saying, “Here we are. We will go up to the place that Yahweh said, because we have sinned.”

41. But Moses said, “Why are you going against the command of Yahweh? It will not succeed.

42. You should not go up because Yahweh is not in your midst; do not let yourselves be defeated in the presence of your enemies,

43. because the AmalekitesHebrew “Amalekite” and the CanaanitesHebrew “Canaanite” are there ⌞before you⌟,Literally “in your presence” and you will fall by the sword; because you have turned back from Yahweh, and Yahweh will not be with you.”

44. But they dared to go to the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and Moses did not depart from the midst of the camp.

45. So the AmalekitesHebrew “Amalekite” and the CanaanitesHebrew “Canaanite” who were living on the mountain descended, and they beat them down, up to Hormah.

11. “ ‘This is how it should be done for each bull, or for the each ram, or for the small four-footed mammal, or ram-lambs, or goats.

12. According to the number that you prepare, so should you do to each according to their number.

13. Every native must do these things to present an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh.

14. If an alien dwells among you, or whoever is in your midst throughout your generations,Hebrew “for your generations” and prepares an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh, he should do as you do.

19. whenever you eat from the food of the land, you will lift up a contribution to Yahweh.

20. You must lift up a contribution of the first batch of your ring-shaped dough bread; you must lift it up as a contribution of the threshing floor.

21. You will give to Yahweh a contribution from the first of your dough throughout your generations.Hebrew “for your generations”

23. all that Yahweh commanded you by the hand of MosesOr “through Moses” from the day that Yahweh commanded and beyond, throughout your generations,Hebrew “for your generations”

24. and if it was done unintentionally ⌞without the knowledge⌟Literally “from the eyes” of the community, then the entire community must prepare one ⌞young bull⌟Literally “a bull a son of cattle” as a burnt offering, as a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh, and its grain offering and its libation, according to the stipulation, and one male goat as a sin offering.

26. All of the community of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” will be forgiven, as well as the alien that dwells in their midst, because the whole community was involved in the unintentional wrong. 

27. “ ‘If one person sins unintentionally, that person will present a female goat ⌞in its first year⌟Literally “a daughter of a year” as a sin offering.

28. And the priest will make atonement for the person who ⌞sinned unintentionally⌟Literally “sinned unintentionally when sinning an unintentional wrong” ⌞before Yahweh⌟,Literally “in the presence of Yahweh” to make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.

29. For the native among the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” and the alien that dwells in their midst, there will be one law for anyone who commits an unintentional wrong.

30. But the one ⌞who acts presumptuously⌟Literally “who acts with a high hand” from among the native or alien blasphemes against Yahweh, and that person must be cut off from the midst of the people.

31. Because he despised the word of Yahweh and broke his command, that person will be surely cut off and bear the guilt.’ ”  

32.  Violation of the Sabbath When the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” were in the desert, they found a man who was gathering wood on the day of the Sabbath.

33. The ones who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and to all the community.

34. And they put him under watch because it was not made clear what should be done to him.

35. And Yahweh said to Moses, “Surely the man must be put to death by stoning him; all the community must stone him with stones from outside the camp.”

36. So the entire community brought him out to a place outside the camp, and ⌞they stoned him to death⌟Literally “they stoned him with stones and he died” just as Yahweh commanded Moses.  

37.  Garment Fringes Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

38. “Speak to the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and tell them to make for themselves tasselsHebrew “tassel” on the hems of their garments throughout their generationsHebrew “for their generations” and to put a blue cord on the tassel of the hem.

## Numbers 16

1.  Korah, Dathan, and Abiram Rebel Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben,

2. took two hundred and fifty men from the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” leaders of the community summoned from the assembly, ⌞renowned men⌟,Literally “men of name” and ⌞they confronted⌟Literally “they rose up before” Moses.

3. They were assembled in front of Moses and Aaron, and they said to them, “⌞You take too much upon yourselves⌟!Literally “It is much for you” All of the community is holy, every one of them, and Yahweh is in their midst, so why do you raise yourselves over the assembly of Yahweh?” 

4. When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.

5. And he said to Korah and to his entire company, saying, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will make known who is his and who is holy, and he will bring him near to him, whomever he chooses he will bring near to him.

6. Do this: take for yourselves censers, Korah and all of your company;Hebrew “his company”

7. tomorrow put fire in them and place incense on them ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh; the man whom Yahweh chooses will be the holy one. You take too much upon yourselves, sons of Levi!” 

8. And Moses said to Korah, “Please listen, sons of Levi!

9. Is it too little for you that the God of Israel set you apart from the community of Israel ⌞to allow you to approach him⌟Literally “to bring you near to him” to do the work of the tabernacle of Yahweh, to stand ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” the community to serve them?

10. ⌞He has allowed you to approach him⌟,Literally “He has brought you near” you with all your brothers, the descendantsOr “sons” of Levi, but yet you also seek the priesthood.

11. Therefore you and your company that has banded together against Yahweh. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?” 

12. Moses sent to call for Dathan and Abiram son of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come!Hebrew “We will not come up!”

13. Is it too little that you have brought us from a land that flows with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, and that you also appoint yourself as a ruler over us?

14. Surely, you have not brought us to a land that flows with milk and honey, and you have not given us the inheritance of fields and a vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come!”Hebrew “We will not come up!” 

15. Then Moses became angry, and he said to Yahweh, “Do not notice their grain offering. I have not offered one donkey from them, and I have not mistreated one of them.”

16. And Moses said to Korah, “You and your entire company will be ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh tomorrow, you and they and Aaron.

17. Each one take his censer, and put incense on itHebrew “on them” and you will present it ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh, and each of you bring his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, you and Aaron, each his censer.”

18. So each of them took his censer, and they put fire on them, and they placed incense on them; they stood at the doorway of the tent of the assembly of Moses and Aaron.

19. And Korah summoned them, the entire community, by the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the community. 

20. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

21. “Separate yourselves from the midst of this community, that I can destroy them in a moment.”

22. And they fell on their faces, and they said, “God, God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and you become angry toward the entire community?” 

23. Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

24. “Speak to the community, saying, ‘Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’ ”

25. So Moses stood up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed after him.

26. He said to the community, saying, “Please turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything ⌞that belongs to them⌟,Literally “that is to them” or you will be destroyed with all their sins.”

27. And so they moved away from around the dwellingsHebrew “dwelling” of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out standing at the doorway of their tents, with their wives, sons, and little children.

28. And Moses said, “In this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; it is not from my heart.

29. ⌞If they die a natural death⌟Literally “If they die like the death of every human” or ⌞if a natural fate is visited upon them⌟,Literally “If the fate of every human is visited upon them” Yahweh has not sent me.

30. But if Yahweh creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up and ⌞all that belongs to them⌟,Literally “All that is for them” and they go down alive to Sheol, and you will know that these men have despised Yahweh.” 

31. And it happened, as soon as he finished ⌞speaking⌟Literally “to speak” all these words, the ground that was under them split open.

32. The land opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their houses and every person ⌞that belonged to Korah⌟Literally “that was to Korah” and all the property.

33. They went down alive to Sheol, they and all that belonged to them, and the land covered over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.

34. All Israel who were around them fled at their cry, because they said, “Lest the land swallow us up!”

35. And fire went out from Yahweh, and it consumed the two hundred and fifty men presenting the incense. 

36. Numbers 16:36–17:13 in the English Bible is 17:1–28 in the Hebrew Bible And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

37. “Say to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, ‘⌞Take out⌟Literally “raise up” the censers from among the place of burning because they are sacred, and scatter the fire outside.

38. The censers of these ⌞who have sinned⌟Literally “sinners” at the cost of their lives, let them be made into gilded leafing plating for the altar; because they presented them ⌞before Yahweh⌟,Literally “in the presence of Yahweh” they are holy; and they will be a sign for the ⌞Israelites⌟.’ ”Literally “sons/children of Israel”

39. Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that the ones who were burned presented, and they hammered them out thinly as plating for the altar;

40. it was a memorial for the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” so that ⌞no strange man⌟NASB translates “no layman” who is not from ⌞the offspring⌟Literally “the seed” of Aaron should approach the presence of Yahweh to burn a smoke offering;That is, an incense offering he will not be like Korah and his company, just as Yahweh had spoken to him by the hand of Moses.Or “through Moses”  

41.  The Israelites Grumble The next day all the community of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of Yahweh!”

42. Then, when the community had gathered against Moses and Aaron, they turned to the tent of assembly, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.

43. And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of assembly,

44. and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

45. “Get away from the midst of this community, and I will finish them in an instant,”Or “in a moment” but they fell on their faces.

46. And Moses and Aaron said, “Take the censer, and put fire on it from the altar. Place incense on it, and bring it quickly to the community, and make atonement for them, because wrath went out from the presence of Yahweh, and a plague has begun.”

47. And so Aaron took it just as Moses had spoken, and he ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people; so he gave the incense and made atonement for the people.

48. He stood between the dead and between the living, and the plague was stopped.

49. Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah.

50. Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the plague was stopped.

4. You must then put them in the tent of assembly ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” the testimonyOr “the statute” where I meet with you.

5. And it will happen, the man whom I will choose, his staff will blossom, and so I will rid from upon myself the grumblings of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” who are grumbling against you.”

6. Moses spoke to the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and all their leaders gave him a staff for each leader, one from ⌞each of their families⌟,Literally “each from the house of their fathers” twelve staffs, and the staff of Aaron was in the midst of their tribes.

7. And Moses put the staffs before Yahweh in the tent of testimony. 

8. Then the next day, Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi blossomed and put forth a flower and produced blossoms, and it produced almonds.

9. Then Moses brought out to all the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” all the staffs before the presence of Yahweh, and they saw, and each man took his staff.

10. And Yahweh said to Moses, “Bring back the staff of Aaron before the testimonyOr “the statute” as a guard and sign for the children of rebellion, and let them finish their grumblings before me and not die.”

11. So Moses did; just as Yahweh commanded him, so he did. 

12. And the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” said to Moses, saying, “Look! We will die! We will be destroyed! All of us will perish!

2. Moreover, bring your brothers with you, the tribe of Levi the tribe of your father, that they may be joined to you and minister to you, you and your sons with you before the tent of testimony.

3. They will keep your responsibility and the responsibility of all the tent, only they may not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, so both you and they will not die.

4. They will be joined to you, and they will keep the responsibility of the tent of assembly for the entire service of the tent; a stranger may not come near you.

5. You will keep the responsibility of the sanctuary and the responsibility of the altar, and there will no longer be wrath on the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

6. Look, I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites from the midst of the children. They are a gift to you given from Yahweh to perform the work of the tent of assembly.

7. But you with your sons will keep your priesthood to perform your priestly duties for everything at the altarOr “for all the things of the altar” and for ⌞the area behind the curtain⌟.Literally “the house of the curtain” I give you the priesthood as a gift, but the stranger who approaches will be put to death.”

12. All the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and their best grain that they have given to Yahweh, I have given them to you.

13. The firstfruits of all that is in their land that they present to Yahweh will be for you; whoever is clean in your house may eat it.

14. All consecrated possessionsHebrew “possession” in Israel will be for you.

15. All the first offspring of a womb of any creature that they offer to Yahweh, whether human or animal, will be yours; you will surely redeem the firstborn of the human and the unclean firstborn of the animal.

16. As to their price of redemption, from ⌞a one-month-old⌟Literally “a son of a month” you will redeem them according to your proper value, five shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerah.

17. Only the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat you will not redeem; they are holy. Their blood you will sprinkle over the altar, and their fat you will turn into smoke as an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh.

18. But their flesh will be for you like the breast section of the wave offering, and it will be for you like the right upper thigh.

23. The LevitesHebrew “Levite” will perform the service of the tent of assembly, and they will bear their guilt, an eternal decree for all your generations. But they will not receive an inheritance in the midst of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel”

24. because the tithesHebrew “tithe” of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” that are ⌞offered⌟Hebrew “raised up” to Yahweh as a contribution, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I said to them, ‘They will not receive an inheritance in the midst of the ⌞Israelites⌟.’ ”Literally “sons/children of Israel” 

25. Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

4. Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh, us and our livestock, into this desert to die here?

5. Why have you brought us from Egypt to bring us to this bad place? It is not a place of seed or figsHebrew “fig” or vinesHebrew “vine” or pomegranate trees,Hebrew “tree” and there is not water to drink.”

16. Then we cried to Yahweh, and he heard our voice; he sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt. And look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.

17. Please let us go through your land. We will not go through a field or vineyard, and we will not drink water from a well. We will go along the road of the king; we will not turn aside right or left until we have gone through your territory.’ ” 

18. Then Edom said to him, “You will not pass through usHebrew “me” lest ⌞we will go out⌟Hebrew “I will go out” to meet you with the sword.”

19. The ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” said to him, “We will go up on the main road, and if weHebrew “I” and our livestockHebrew “my livestock” drink your water, we will pay for it.Hebrew “I will give their worth” It is only a small matter; let us pass through on our feet.”Hebrew “I will go through on my feet”

20. But he said, “You will not go through.” And Edom went out to meet ⌞them⌟Hebrew “him” with a large army and a strong hand.

21. So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, and Israel turned aside from him.  

22.  Aaron Dies And they set out from Kadesh. The ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” the whole community, came to Mount Hor.

23. Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron on Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Edom, saying,

24. “Let Aaron be gathered to his people; he will not come into the land that I have given to the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” because you rebelled against ⌞my word⌟Literally “my mouth” at the waters of Meribah.

25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and take them up Mount Hor.

26. Strip off Aaron’s garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; Aaron will be gathered to his people, and he will die there.”

27. So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the community.

28. And Moses stripped off Aaron’s garments and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar went down from the mountain.

29. All the community saw that Aaron died; so all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.Hebrew “day”   

## Numbers 21

1.  Arad Captured The Canaanite king of Arad, who was dwelling in the Negev,An arid region south of the Judean hills heard that Israel came along the way of Atharim; he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.

2. Israel made a vow to Yahweh, and they said, “If you will surely give this people into ourHebrew “my” hand, then weHebrew “I” ⌞will destroy⌟Literally “devote to God” their cities.”

3. Yahweh heard the voice of Israel; he gave to them the Canaanites, and ⌞they destroyed them⌟Literally “they devoted to God” and their cities. They called the name of the place Hormah. 

4. They set out from Mount Hor by the way of the ⌞Red Sea⌟Literally “sea of reed” to go around the land of Edom; but ⌞the people became impatient⌟Literally “the life of the people became short” along the way.

5. The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the desert? There is no food and no water, and our hearts detest this miserable food.”  

6.  The Bronze Serpent And Yahweh sent among the people poisonous snakes; they bit the people, and many people from Israel died.

7. The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh and let him remove the snakesHebrew “snake” from among us.” So Moses prayed for the people.

8. And Yahweh said to Moses, “Make for yourself a snake and place it on a pole. WhenHebrew “And it will happen” anyone is bitten and looks at it, that person will live.”

9. So Moses made a snake of bronze, and he placed it on the pole; wheneverHebrew “And it will happen” a snake bit someone, and that person looked at the snake of bronze, he lived. 

10. The ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” set out and encamped at Oboth.

11. They set out from Oboth and encamped at Iye Abarim in the desert, which was in front of Moab ⌞toward the sunrise⌟.Literally “from the east of the sun”

12. From there they set out and encamped at the valley of Zered.

13. From there they set out and encamped beyond Arnon, which is in the desert that goes out from the boundary of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” because Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.Hebrew “Amorite”

14. Therefore thus it is said in the scroll of the Wars of Yahweh,  “Waheb in Suphah, and the wadis of Arnon, 

15. and the slope of the wadis that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar and lies at the boundary of Moab.”  

16. From there they went to Beer, which is the water well where Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Gather the people, that I may give them water.”

17. Then Israel sang this song, “Arise, well water! Sing to it!

18. Well water that the princes dug, that the leaders of the people dug, with a staff and with their rods.” And from the desert they continued to Mattanah,

19. and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;

20. and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the territory of Moab, by the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the surface of the wasteland.  

21.  Sihon and Og Defeated Israel sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” saying,

22. “Let us go through your land; we will not turn aside into a field or vineyard; we will not drink well water along the way of the king until we have gone through your territory.”

23. But Sihon did not allow Israel to go through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel; he came to the desert, to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel.

24. But Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and they took possession of his land from Arnon to Jabbok, until the ⌞Ammonites⌟,Literally “sons of Ammon” because the boundary of the ⌞Ammonites⌟Literally “sons of Ammon” was strong.

25. Israel took all these cities, and Israel inhabited all the cities of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” in Heshbon, and in all its environs.Hebrew “her daughters;” other modern versions translate “its villages”

26. Because Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land from his hand until Arnon.

27. Thus the ones who quote proverbs say,  “Come to Heshbon! Let it be built! And let the city of Sihon be established. 

28. Because fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of theOr “the dominant” high places of Arnon. 

29. Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, people of Chemosh. He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to the king of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” Sihon. 

30. We destroyed them; Heshbon has perished up to Dibon; we laid waste up to Nophah, which ⌞reaches⌟Literally “is up to” Medeba.”  

31. Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.Hebrew “Amorite”

32. Moses sent to explore Jaazer; they captured ⌞its environs⌟Hebrew “her daughters;” other modern versions translate “its villages” and dispossessed the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” who were there. 

33. Then they turned and went up by the way of the Bashan, and Og king of the Bashan and all his people went out to meet them for battle at Edrei.

34. And Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not fear him because I will give him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You will do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite” who was living in Heshbon.”

35. And so they destroyed him and his sons, and all his people until they had not spared a survivor; and they took possession of his land.   

## Numbers 22

1.  Balak and Balaam The ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” set out, and they encamped on the desert-plateau of Moab, across from Jericho beyond the Jordan.

2. Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel did to the Amorites,Hebrew “Amorite”

3. and Moab was very terrified in the presence of the people because ⌞they⌟Hebrew “he” or “it” were numerous; and Moab dreaded the presence of the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

4. And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now the crowd will lick up all around us, like a bull devours the grass of the field.” And Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.

5. He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the river,That is, the Euphrates in the land of the children of his people, to summon him, saying, “Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover ⌞the surface of the land⌟;Literally “the eye of the land” they are about to dwell opposite me.

6. Now, please go, curse this people for me because theyHebrew “he” are stronger than me; perhaps I will be able to strike themHebrew “he” and drive themHebrew “he” out from the land because I know whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you cursed is cursed.” 

7. So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went with a fee for divination in their hand; they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him.

8. He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will return, and I will return word to you, just as Yahweh speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.

9. And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”

10. And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent word to me,

11. ‘Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover ⌞the surface of the land⌟.Literally “the eye of the land” Now, go, curse themHebrew “him” for me. Perhaps I will be able to attack themHebrew “him” and drive themHebrew “him” out.”

12. God said to Balaam, “You will not go with them; you will not curse the people, because theyHebrew “he” are blessed.”

13. Balaam got up in the morning, and he said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land, because Yahweh refused to allow me to go with you.”

14. The princes of Moab got up and went to Balak, and they said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 

15. Balak again sent many princes, who were more honored ⌞than the former⌟.Literally “than these”

16. They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor, ‘Please, let nothing keep you from coming to me

17. because I will surely honor you greatly, and all that you say to me I will do. Please, come; curse this people for me.’ ”

18. Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “Even though Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond ⌞the command of Yahweh⌟Literally “the mouth of Yahweh” my God to do a little or a lot.

19. And now please, ⌞you also stay here⌟Literally “please stay in this” the night, and ⌞let me find out⌟Literally “let me know” again what Yahweh will say with me.”

20. And God came to Balaam at night, and he said to him, “If the men have come to call you, get up and go with them; but only the word that I will speak to you, you will do.”

21. So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey, and he went with the princes of Moab.  

22.  Balaam and the Angel But ⌞God became angry⌟Literally “God’s nose became hot” because he was going, and the angel of Yahweh stood in the road as an adversary to him; he was riding on his donkey, and two servants were with him.

23. The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back to the road.

24. The angel of Yahweh stood in the narrow path of the vineyards, with ⌞a wall on either side⌟.Literally “a wall from this and a wall from this”

25. When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she pressed herself into the wall, and she pressed the foot of Balaam into the wall, so he struck her again.

26. Then the angel of Yahweh went further ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was not a way to turn aside to the right or left.

27. When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam, so ⌞Balaam became angry⌟,Literally “Balaam’s nose became hot” and he struck the donkey with his staff.

28. Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What did I do to you that you struck me these three times?”

29. Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you made a mockery of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!”

30. The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” He said, “No.” 

31. Then Yahweh exposed the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and he bowed down and worshiped to his face.

32. The angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why have you struck this donkey three times? Look, I have come out as an adversary because your conduct is perverse before me.

33. The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from my face, then I would have killed you and kept her alive.”

34. Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned because I did not know that you were standing to meet me in the road. Now, ⌞if it is displeasing to you⌟,Literally “if it is evil in your eyes” I will turn back.”

35. The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I will speak to you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 

36. When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him by the city of Moab, which was on the boundary of Aaron at the end of the territory.

37. And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send to meet with you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to honor you?”

38. Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I came to you now. Am I really able to speak anything at all? I speak the word that God puts in my mouth.”

39. Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-Huzoth.

40. And Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he sent them to Balaam and to the princes who were with him.

41. And it happened, in the morning Balak took Balaam and took him up to Bamoth-Baal, and he saw from there the end of the nation.   

## Numbers 23

1.  Balaam’s Oracles Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me this: seven altars. And prepare for me this: seven bulls and seven rams.”

2. And Balak did just as Balaam spoke, and Balak offered Balaam a bull and a ram on the altar.

3. And Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself at your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell to you.” So he went to a barren height. 

4. And God met with Balaam, and he said to him, “I have arranged seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on the altar.”

5. Yahweh put a word in the mouth of Balaam and said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.”

6. So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.

7. And he lifted up his oracle and said,  “From Aram Balak lead me, from the mountains of the east the king of Moab, ‘Go for me, curse Jacob, and go, denounce Israel.’ 

8. How can I curse whom God has not cursed, and how can I denounce whom Yahweh has not denounced? 

9. Because from the top of the rocks I see him, from hilltops I watch him. Behold, a people who dwell alone, they do not consider themselves among the nations. 

10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, or as a number the fourth part of Israel? Let my life die the death of an upright person, and let my end be like his!”  

11. And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have surely blessed them!”

12. He answered and said, “⌞Should I not speak⌟Literally “Should I not observe to speak” what Yahweh puts in my mouth?” 

13. Then Balak said, “Please walk with me to another place where you will see them, but you will only see part of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there.”

14. So he took him to the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

15. BalaamHebrew “He” said to Balak, “Station yourself here at the burnt offering while I myself meet with Yahweh there.”

16. Then Yahweh met with Balaam, and he put a word in his mouth, and he said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.”

17. He came to him, and behold, he was standing at his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”

18. Then ⌞he uttered⌟Literally “he lifted up” his oracle, and said,  “Stand up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, son of Zippor! 

19. God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of humankind, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? And has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it? 

20. Behold, I have received a command to bless; when he has blessed, I cannot cause it to return. 

21. He has no regard for evil in Jacob, and he does not see trouble in Israel; Yahweh his God is with him, and a shoutOr “a blast” of a king is among them.Hebrew “him” 

22. God, who brings them out from Egypt, is like the strengthOr “like the horns” of a wild ox for them.Hebrew “him” 

23. Because there is no sorcery against Jacob, and there is no divination against Israel. NowOr “At the right time” it will be said to Jacob and Israel, what God has done! 

24. Look! the people will rise like the lion; he raises himself and will not lie down until he eats the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.”  

25. Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse themHebrew “him” at all, nor bless themHebrew “him” at all!”

26. But Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Whatever Yahweh speaks I will do’?” 

27. Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please, come, I will take you to another place; perhaps ⌞it will be acceptable to⌟Literally “it will be right in the eyes of” God, and you will curse for me from there.”

28. So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks down on the face of the Jeshimon.Or “the wasteland”

29. And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me these seven altars, and prepare for me these seven bulls and seven rams.”

30. Balak did just as Balaam said, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar.   

## Numbers 24

1.  Balaam Continues to Utter Oracles And Balaam saw that ⌞it pleased⌟Literally “it was good in the eyes of Yahweh” Yahweh to bless Israel, and he did not go ⌞as other times⌟Literally “as time on time” ⌞to seek out⌟Literally “to meet” sorcery; instead, he set his face toward the desert.

2. Balaam lift up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, and the spirit of God was upon it.That is, Israel

3. He ⌞uttered⌟Literally “lifted up” his oracle and said,  “The declaration of Balaam son Beor, the declaration of the man whose eyes are closed, 

4. the declaration of the hearer of God’s words,Or “God’s sayings” who sees the revelation of Shaddai,Often translated “the Almighty” falling down but whose eyes are uncovered. 

5. How good are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel! 

6. They are spread out like valleys, like gardens on a river, like aloes planted by Yahweh, like cedars at the waters. 

7. He will pour water from his buckets, and his offspring will be like many waters; his king will be higher than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted. 

8. God, who brings him out from Egypt, is like the strengthOr “the horns” of a wild ox for him. He will devour the nations who are his enemies; he will break their bones; he will pierce them with his arrows. 

9. He crouches, he lies down like a lion, and like a lioness, who will rouse him? They who bless you will be blessed, and they who curse you will be cursed.”  

10. Then ⌞Balak became angry with⌟Literally “the nose of Balak became hot against” Balaam, and he clapped his hands and said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but look, you have surely blessed them these three times.

11. ⌞Flee⌟Literally “Flee for yourself” to your place now. I said I would richly honor you, but look, Yahweh has withheld honor from you.”

12. Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,

13. ‘If Balak gave to me the fullness of his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond ⌞the command of Yahweh⌟Literally “the mouth of Yahweh” to do good or evil, from my heart; what Yahweh speaks, I will speak’?Hebrew “I will speak it”

14. And now, look, I am about to go to my people; I will advise you what this people will do to your people ⌞in the following days⌟.”Literally “in the last of the days” 

15. And he ⌞uttered⌟Literally “lifted up” his oracle and said,  “The declaration of Balaam son of Beor, and the declaration of the man whose eye is closed, 

16. the declaration of the hearer of God’s words,Or “God’s sayings” and the knower of the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of Shaddai,Often translated “the Almighty” who is falling, and his eyes are revealed. 

17. I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; a star will go out from Jacob, and a scepter will rise from Israel; it will crush the foreheads of Moab and destroy all the children of Seth. 

18. Edom will be a captive; Seir, its enemies, will be a captive, and Israel will be acting ⌞courageously⌟.Literally “with physical strength” 

19. SomeoneHebrew “He” from Jacob will rule and will destroy a remnantOr “survivor” from the city.” 

20. And he looked at Amalek, ⌞uttered⌟Literally “lifted up” his oracle, and said, “Amalek is firstOr “among” of the nations, but his future will be forever ruin.”  

21. And he looked at the Kenites,Hebrew “Kenite” ⌞uttered⌟Literally “lifted up” his oracle, and said,  “Steady is your dwelling place; in the rock is your nest. 

22. Nevertheless, the Kenite will be burned; how long will Asshur keepHebrew “take” you captive?”  

23. Again he ⌞uttered⌟Literally “lifted up” his oracle and said,  “Woe, who will live when God establishes this?Hebrew “it” 

24. The ships will come from the hand of the Kittim, and they will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber; also he will be forever ruin.”  

25. Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way.   

## Numbers 25

13. and it will be for him and his ⌞offspring⌟Literally “seed” after him a covenant of an eternal priesthood because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the ⌞Israelites⌟.’ ”Literally “sons/children of Israel”

## Numbers 30

1.  Laws for Vows Then Moses spoke to ⌞the leaders⌟Literally “the heads” of the tribes concerning the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” saying, “This is the word that Yahweh commanded:

2. if a man makes a vow for Yahweh or swears an oath with a binding pledge on himself, he must not render his word invalid; he must do all that went out from his mouth. 

3. “If a woman makes a vow to Yahweh, and she binds a pledge on herself in her father’s house in your childhood,

4. but if her father hears her vow or her pledge that she bound on herself and says nothing to her, then all her vows will stand, and every pledge that she binds on her life will stand.

5. If her father forbids her on the day he hears of it, all her vows or her pledges that she bound on herself will not stand, and Yahweh will forgive her because her father has forgiven her. 

6. “If ⌞she has a husband⌟Literally “she is to a man” while bound by her vows or a rash promise of her lips,

7. and her husband hears of it and is silent on the day he hears it, her vows will stand, and her pledge that she bound upon herself will stand.

8. But if on the day her husband hears of it, he forbids her, then he will nullify her vow that she is under, and the rash promise of her lips that she bound on herself; and Yahweh will forgive her. 

9. “But the vow of a widow or a woman who is divorced, all that she binds on herself will stand on her.

10. But if she made a vow in her husband’s house, or bound herself on a pledge with a sworn oath,

11. and her husband heard it but was silent to her, and he did not forbid her, all her vows will stand and every pledge that she bound on herself will stand.

12. But if her husband nullified them on the day he hears them, all her vows going out of her lips concerning her vows or the pledge on herself will not stand; her husband has nullified them, and Yahweh will forgive her. 

13. “Any vow and any sworn oath of a pledge to inflict on herself, her husband can confirm it or her husband can nullify it.

14. But if her husband is completely silent from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her pledges that are on her; he confirms them because he was silent to her on the day he heard them.

15. But if he indeed nullifies them after he hears them, then he will bear her guilt.” 

16. These are the decrees that Yahweh commanded Moses, as between a husband and his wife, and between a father and his daughter, while her childhood is in her father’s house.   

## Numbers 31

20. You will purify yourselves and every garment and every object of hide and all the work of goats’ hair, and every object of wood.” 

21. Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of the battle who came from the war, “This is the decree of the law that Yahweh commanded Moses.

22. Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead—

23. everything that will go through the fire—you will pass through the fire, and it will be clean, and only in waters of impurity will it be purified. Whatever does not go into the fire you will pass through the waters.

24. And you will wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you will come into the camp.”  

25.  Division of the War-Booty Yahweh said to Moses, saying,

26. “You and Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the ⌞families⌟Literally “fathers” of the community, ⌞take count⌟Literally “lift up the head” of the war-booty that was captured, both humansHebrew “human” and the domestic animals;Hebrew “animal”

28. Exact a tribute for Yahweh from the men of the war, those who went out to the battle, one from five hundred persons, and from the cattle and from the male donkeys and from the flock;

29. take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to Yahweh.

30. From half of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” take one share drawn by lot from the fifty from the humans,Hebrew “human” from the cattle, from the male donkeys, from the flock, from all the domestic animals,Hebrew “animal” and give them to the Levities who keep the responsibilities of the tabernacle of Yahweh.”

31. Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 

32. Thus the war-booty that remained of the plunder that the people of the battle plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand flocks of sheep,

33. seventy-two thousand cattle,

34. sixty-one thousand male donkeys,

35. and the life of humankind, from the women who did not ⌞have sexual intercourse with a man⌟,Literally “who has known the bed of a male” all the personsHebrew “person” were thirty-two thousand.

39. Of the male donkeys there were thirty thousand five hundred, and the tribute to Yahweh was sixty-one;

40. the humansHebrew “human” were sixteen thousand, and the tribute to Yahweh was thirty-two persons.

41. And Moses gave away the tribute of the contribution of Yahweh to Eleazar the priest, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 

42. From the half of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” which Moses divided from the men who were fighting,

48. Then the leaders of the thousands of the army, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, approached Moses,

49. and they said to Moses, “Your servants have ⌞taken count⌟Literally “lifted up the head” of the men of war who were ⌞in our charge⌟,Literally “in our hand” and no man is missing from us.

50. So we brought the offering of Yahweh, what each man found, objects of gold, bangles,Hebrew “bangle” bracelets,Hebrew “bracelet” rings,Hebrew “ring” earrings,Hebrew “earring” and female ornaments,Hebrew “ornament” to make atonement for ourselves ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh.”

51. Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all objects of work.

52. All the gold of the contribution that they raised up to Yahweh, from the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

53. The men of battle plundered each for himself.

54. So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders of the thousands and hundreds, and they brought it to the tent of the assembly as a memorial for the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” before Yahweh.   

## Numbers 32

1.  Gad and Reuben Inherit Gilead The descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben and the descendantsOr “sons” of Gad had a very large number of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold it was a place for livestock.

2. The descendantsOr “sons” of Gad and the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben came, and they said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, saying,

3. “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,

4. the land that Yahweh struck before the community of Israel, is a land of livestock, and your servants have livestock.”

5. They said, “If we have found favor in ⌞your sight⌟,Literally “your eyes” let this land be given to your servants as property; do not lead us across the Jordan.” 

6. But Moses said to the descendantsOr “sons” of Gad and to the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, “Will your brothers go to war while you yourselves live here?

7. Why are you discouraging the hearts of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” from crossing into the land that Yahweh gave to them?

8. This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.

9. When they went up to the valleyOr “the wadi” of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” so that they did not come to the land that Yahweh gave to them.

10. So ⌞Yahweh’s anger burned⌟Literally “Yahweh’s nose became hot” on that day, and he swore an oath, saying,

11. ‘The men who went up from Egypt, from ⌞those twenty years old⌟Literally “a son of twenty years” and above, will not see the land that I swore with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because they have not wholly followed me,

12. except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they followed Yahweh wholly.’

13. And ⌞Yahweh became angry⌟,Literally “Yahweh’s nose became hot” and he made them wander in the desert forty years until the entire generation who did evil in the ⌞sight of Yahweh⌟Literally “eyes of Yahweh” ⌞had died⌟.Literally “had completed”

14. Behold, you stand in the place of your fathers, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more ⌞Yahweh’s fierce anger⌟Literally “the fierce anger of Yahweh’s nose” against Israel.

15. If you turn from following him, he will again abandon themHebrew “him” in the wilderness, and you would have destroyed all these people.” 

16. They came near to him and said, “We will build sheep pens here for the flock of our livestock and cities for our little children;

17. but we ourselves will become armed and ready before the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” until we have brought them to their place, and our little children will live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

18. We will not return to our houses until the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” each obtain theirHebrew “his” inheritance for themselves.

19. For we will not take possession with them from across the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has come to us from across the Jordan to the east.” 

20. So Moses said to them, “If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh for the war,

21. and everyone of you armed cross the Jordan ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh until he has driven out his enemies from before him,

22. and the land is subdued ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh, then afterward you will return and be free of obligation from Yahweh and from Israel, and this land will be your property ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh.

23. But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh, and know that your sin will find you.

24. Build for yourselves cities for your little children and sheep pens for your flocks; what has gone out from your mouth you will do.” 

25. So the descendantsOr “sons” of Gad and the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben said to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands.

26. Our little children, our wives, our livestock, and all of our animalsHebrew “animal” ⌞will remain⌟Literally “will be there” in the cities of Gilead,

27. but your servants, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross over ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh to the war, just as my lord says.” 

28. So Moses commanded them, Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the ⌞families⌟Literally “fathers” of the tribes of the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

29. Moses said to them, “If the descendantsOr “sons” of Gad and the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, everyone who is armed for the war, cross over the Jordan ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, you will give them the land of Gilead as property.

30. But if they will not cross over with you armed, they will acquire land in your midst in Canaan.”

31. The descendantsOr “sons” of Gad and the descendants of Reuben answered and said, “What Yahweh has commanded your servants, we will do.

32. We ourselves will cross over armed ⌞before⌟Literally “in the presence of” Yahweh to the land of Canaan, and the property of our inheritance will remain with us beyond the Jordan.” 

33. So Moses gave to them, to the descendantsOr “sons” of Gad and the descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben, and to half of the tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon the king of Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of the Bashan, the land with its cities and their territories, the cities of the surrounding land.

34. The descendantsOr “sons” of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer,

35. and Atroth Shophan, Jazer, and Jogbehah,

36. and Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, the cities of Mibzar, and the sheep pens for flocks.

37. The descendantsOr “sons” of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

38. and Nebo, Baal Meon (their namesHebrew “name” were changed), and Sibmah, and ⌞they renamed⌟Literally “they called to names the names” the cities that they rebuilt.

39. The descendantsOr “sons” of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and they captured it and drove out the AmoritesHebrew “Amorite” who were in it.

40. So Moses gave Gilead to Makir son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.

41. And Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their unwalled villages, and he called them Havvoth Jair.

42. Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah after his own name.

53. you will dispossess the land and live in it because I have given the land to you to possess it.

54. You will distribute the land by lot according to your clans; to the larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller group you will give less inheritance. However the lot falls for him, there the lot will be. You will distribute it according to the tribes of your ancestors.Or “fathers”

55. But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, then it will happen that whomever you let remain of them will be like irritants in your eyes and like thorns in your sides; they will be your enemies in the land in which you live.

56. And just as I planned to do to them, I will do to you.’ ”   

## Numbers 34

2. “Command the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” and say to them, ‘When you come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that was allotted to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its boundaries.

3. Your southern edge will be from the desert of Zin toward the side of Edom, and your southern border will be from the end of the Salt SeaThat is, the Dead Sea to the east;

4. your boundary will turn from the south to the ascent of AkrabbimOr “Scorpions” and will pass over to Zin, and its limits will be from the south of Kadesh Barnea; it will continue to Hazar Addar and pass over to Azmon.

5. The boundary will turn from Azmon to the valley of Egypt, and its limits will be to the sea. 

6. “ ‘Your western boundary will be the Great Sea;That is, the Mediterranean this will be your western boundary.

7. Your northern border will be from the Great Sea;That is, the Mediterranean you will make a boundary from the Great SeaThat is, the Mediterranean to Mount Hor.

8. From Mount Hor you will make a boundary to reach Hamath; the limits of the territory will be at Zedad.

9. The boundary will go out to Ziphron, and its limits will be at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary to the north. 

10. “ ‘You will mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar Enan to Shepham;

13. So Moses commanded the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” saying, “This is the land that you will obtain as an inheritance for yourself by lot, which Yahweh commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes.

## Numbers 35

1.  Cities for the Levites Yahweh spoke to Moses on the desert plains of Moab beyond the Jordan across Jericho, saying,

2. “Command the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their property cities to live in; and you will give to the Levites pastureland all around the cities.Hebrew “them”

3. The cities will be theirs to live in, and their pasturelands will be for their domestic animals, for their possessions, and their animals.Hebrew “animal” 

4. “The pasturelands of the cities that you will give to the Levites will extend from the wall of the city to a distance of a thousand cubits all around.

5. You will measure outside the city the eastern edge two thousand cubits, for the southern edge two thousand cubits, for the western edge two thousand cubits, and for the northern edge two thousand cubits, with the city in the middle; this will be for them the pasturelands of the cities. 

6. “All the cities that you will give the Levites will be six cities of refuge, to which the killer can flee; in addition to them you will give forty-two cities.

7. All the cities that you will give to the Levites will be forty-eight cities, them with their pasturelands.

8. And the cities that you will give from the property of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” you will take more from the larger group and less from the smaller group; each of them will give according to the portion of their inheritance according to the portion that he inherits.”  

9.  Cities of Refuge Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

10. “Speak to the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

11. you will select for yourselves cities for your cities of refuge, that a killer who has killed a person unintentionally can flee there.

12. The cities will be to you a refuge from a redeemer, so that the killer will not die until he stands before the community for judgment.

13. The cities that you are to give will be your six cities of refuge.

14. You will give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they will be cities of refuge.

15. To the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” to the alien, and to the temporary resident in their midst there will be these six cities as a refuge to which anyone who unintentionally kills a person may flee. 

16. “ ‘But if he hit him with an object of iron, so that he dies, the killer must surely be put to death.

17. And if he hit him with a stone in the hand, by which he will die, and he does die, he is a killer; the killer must surely be put to death.

18. Or if he hit him with a wooden object, by which he will die, and he does die, he is a killer; the killer must surely be put to death.

19. The blood avenger himself will put the killer to death; he must put him to death when meeting him.

20. If he shoves him in hatred, or he throws something at him with intention, and he dies,

21. or if he hits him in hostility with his hand, and he dies, the one that struck him will put to death the killer when meeting him. 

22. “ ‘Or if in an instant he shoved him, not in hostility, or threw something at him without intention,

23. or with any stone, without seeing it dropped on him so that he dies, while he was not seeking his injury,

24. then the community will judge between the striker and between the blood avenger according to these ordinances.

25. The community will deliver the killer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the community will restore him to the city of his refuge to which he fled; and he will live there in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with holy oil.

26. But if the killer surely goes out of the territory of the city of his refuge to which he fled,

27. and the blood avenger finds him outside the territory of the city of his refuge, and the blood avenger kills the killer, ⌞he will not be guilty of blood⌟Literally “there will not be blood for him”

28. because he must live in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the killer will return to the land of his property.

29. These things will be as a decree of justice for you for your generations in all your dwellings. 

30. “ ‘If anyone kills a person, the killer will be put to death ⌞according to the testimony⌟Literally “according to the mouth” of witnesses, but someone cannot die on testimony of one person.

31. Also, you will not take a ransom payment for the life of a killer who is guilty of death; indeed, he must surely be put to death.

32. You will not take a ransom payment for the one that flees to the city of his refuge, so that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest.

33. So you will not pollute the land in which you are; because blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is poured out on it except with the blood of the one who poured it out.

34. You will not defile the land on which you are living because I am living in the midst of it; I am Yahweh; I am living in the midst of the ⌞Israelites⌟.’ ”Literally “sons/children of Israel”   

## Numbers 36

1.  Inheritance Through Marriage ⌞The leaders⌟Literally “The heads” of the familiesOr “fathers” of the clans of descendantsOr “sons” of Gilead the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, of the clans of the descendantsOr “sons” of Joseph came near and spoke ⌞before⌟Literally “before the face of” Moses and ⌞before⌟Literally “before the face of” ⌞the leaders⌟Literally “the heads” of the familiesHebrew “of the fathers” of the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

2. And they said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land by lot as an inheritance to the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.

3. But if they become wives to one of the sons from another tribe of the ⌞Israelites⌟,Literally “sons/children of Israel” their inheritance will disappear from the inheritance of our ancestors,Or “fathers” and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; the lot of our inheritance would disappear.

4. When the Jubilee of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” ⌞comes⌟,Literally “will be” it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; and their inheritance will disappear from the tribe of our father.” 

5. Then Moses commanded the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” by the command of Yahweh, saying, “The tribe of the descendantsOr “sons” of Joseph is right regarding what they are speaking.

6. This is the word that Yahweh commanded the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘⌞Let them marry⌟Literally “Let them be as wives” ⌞whomever they like⌟;Literally “they will be as the good in their eyes” only ⌞they must marry⌟Literally “they must be as wives” from within the clan of the tribe of their father.

7. Thus an inheritance of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” will not go around from tribe to tribe. Rather, the inheritance of each tribe of his father will remain with the ⌞Israelites⌟.Literally “sons/children of Israel”

8. Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” will ⌞marry⌟Literally “be a wife to” one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” will possess the inheritance of his ancestors.Or “fathers”

9. Therefore an inheritance will not go around from one tribe to another tribe because the tribes of the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” will each hold to their own inheritance.’ ” 

10. Just as Yahweh commanded to Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did:

11. Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, ⌞married⌟Literally “were as wives to” the sons of their uncles.

12. ⌞They married⌟Literally “They were as wives to” those from the sons of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance ⌞remained⌟Literally “was” among the tribe of the clan of their ancestors.Or “fathers” 

13. These were the commands and the stipulations that Yahweh commanded by the hand of MosesOr “through Moses” to the ⌞Israelites⌟Literally “sons/children of Israel” on the desert-plateaus of Moab by the Jordan across Jericho.
