# Hebrews

## Hebrews 1

1.  God’s Full and Final Revelation in the Son AlthoughHere “although” is supplied as a component of the participle (“spoke”) which is understood as concessive God spoke long ago in many partsOr “portions” and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,

2. in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world,Or “the universe”; literally “the ages”

3. who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of power.Some manuscripts have “by the word of his power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down” When heHere “when” is supplied as a component of the participle (“had made”) which is understood as temporal had made purification for sins through him, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,

4. having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.  

5.  The Son Superior to the Angels For to which of the angels did he ever say,  “You are my son, today I have begotten you,”A quotation from Ps 2:7  and again,  “I will be ⌞his father⌟Literally “to him for a father”, and he will be ⌞my son⌟Literally “to me for a son””?A quotation from 2 Sam 7:14 (cf. 1 Chr 17:13)  

6. And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,  “And let all the angels of God worship him.”A quotation from Deut 32:43 and Ps 97:7  

7. And concerning the angels he says,  “The one who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire,”A quotation from Ps 104:4  

8. but concerning the Son,  “Your throne, O God, is ⌞forever and ever⌟Literally “for the age of the age”, and the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom. 

9. You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, your God, has anointed you with the olive oil of joy more than your companions.A quotation from Ps 45:6–7  

10. And,  “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of your hands; 

11. they will perish, but you continue, and they will all become old like a garment, 

12. and like a robe you will roll them up, and like a garment they will be changed; but you are the same, and your years will not run out.”A quotation from Ps 102:25–27  

13. But to which of the angels has he ever said,  “Sit down at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”A quotation from Ps 110:1  

14. Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?   

## Hebrews 2

1.  Warning Not to Neglect Salvation Because of this, it is all the more necessary that we pay attention to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.

2. For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty,

3. how will we escape if weHere “if” is supplied as a component of the participle (“neglect”) which is understood as conditional neglect so great a salvation which had its beginning when itHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal infinitive (“was spoken”) was spoken through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard,

4. whileHere “while” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (“was testifying at the same time”) God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.  

5.  The Son’s Humiliation and Suffering For he did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking.

6. But someone testified somewhere, saying,  “What is man, that you remember him, or the son of man, that you care for him? 

7. You made him for a short time lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor;Several important manuscripts add “and placed him over the works of your hands” to the end of v. 7 

8. you subjected all things under his feet.A quotation from Ps 8:4–6  For in subjecting all things,Some manuscripts have “subjecting all things to him” he left nothing that was not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him,

9. but we see Jesus, for a short time made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that apart from GodSome manuscripts have “so that by the grace of God” he might taste death on behalf of everyone.

10. For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.

11. For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,

12. saying,  “I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you.”A quotation from Ps 22:22  

13. And again,  “I will trust in him.”A quotation from Isa 8:17  And again,  “Behold, I and the children God has given me.”A quotation from Isa 8:18  

14. Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these same things, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,

15. and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives.

16. For surely he is not concerned with angels, but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham.

17. Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all respects, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.

18. For in that which he himself suffered when heHere “when” is supplied as a component of the participle (“was tempted”) which is understood as temporal was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.   

## Hebrews 3

1.  The Superiority of Jesus to Moses Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,

2. who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses also was in his household.Some manuscripts have “in all his household”

3. For this one is considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who builds it has greater honor than the house.

4. For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all things is God.

5. And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,

6. but Christ was faithfulThe words “was faithful” are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous verse and v. 2 as a son over his house, whose house we are, ifSome manuscripts have “if indeed” we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of.  

7.  A Serious Warning Against Unbelief Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,  “Today, if you hear his voice, 

8. do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness, 

9. where your fathers tested me by trial and saw my works

10. for forty years. Therefore I was angry with this generation, and I said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, and they do not know my ways.’ 

11. As I swore in my anger, ‘⌞They will never enter⌟Literally “if they will enter” into my rest.’ ”A quotation from Ps 95:7b-11  

12. Watch out, brothers, lest there be in some of you an evil, unbelieving heart, with the result that you fall awayHere “with the result that” is supplied as a component of the infinitive (“fall away”) which is understood as result from the living God.

13. But encourage one another ⌞day by day⌟Literally “by each day”, as long as it is called “today,” so that ⌞none of you become hardened⌟Literally “not anyone of you be hardened” by the deception of sin.

14. For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of our commitment steadfast until the end,

15. ⌞while it is said⌟Literally “in the saying”,  “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”A quotation from Ps 95:7b-8  

16. For who, when theyHere “when” is supplied as a component of the participle (“heard”) which is understood as temporal heard it, were disobedient? Surely it was not all who went out from Egypt through Moses?

17. And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?

18. And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?

19. And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.   

## Hebrews 4

1.  The Rest that Remains for the People of God Therefore let us fear, while thereHere “while” is supplied as a component of the participle (“remains”) which is understood as temporal remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of it.

2. ⌞For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us⌟Literally “for we are also having had the good news proclaimed”, just as those also did, but the message ⌞they heard⌟Literally “of hearing” did not benefit them, because theyHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“united”) which is understood as causal were not united with those who heard it in faith.

3. For we who have believed enter into rest,Some manuscripts have “that rest” just as he has said,  “As I swore in my anger, ‘⌞They will never enter⌟Literally “if they will enter” into my rest.’ ”A quotation from Ps 95:11  And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.

4. For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”A quotation from Gen 2:2

5. and in this passage again, ‘⌞They will never enter⌟Literally “if they will enter” into my rest.’ ”A quotation from Ps 95:11

6. Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience,

7. again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before,  “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”A quotation from Ps 95:7b-8 (see also Heb 3:7–8, 15)  

8. For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things.

9. Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.

10. For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God did from his own works. 

11. Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience.

12. For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart.

13. And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom ⌞we must give our account⌟Literally “our account”.  

14.  Jesus Our Great High Priest Therefore, because we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.

15. For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all things in the same way, without sin.

16. Therefore let us approach with confidence to the throne of grace, in order that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.   

## Hebrews 5

1.  A High Priest Like Melchizedek For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins,

2. being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness,

3. and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins ⌞for himself also, as well as for the people⌟Literally “as for the people so also for himself”.

4. And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was.

5. Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him,  “You are my Son, today I have begotten you,”A quotation from Ps 2:7  

6. just as also in another place he says,  “You are a priest ⌞forever⌟Literally “for the age” according to the order of Melchizedek,”A quotation from Ps 110:4  

7. who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence.

8. Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered,

9. and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,

10. being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.  

11.  Advanced Teaching Hindered by Immaturity Concerning thisLiterally “which” ⌞we have much to say and it is difficult to explain⌟Literally “great for us the message and hard to explain to say”, since you have become sluggish in hearing.

12. For indeed, although youHere “although” is supplied as a component of the participle (“ought”) which is understood as concessive ought to be teachers ⌞by this time⌟Literally “because of the time”, you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God, and ⌞you have need of⌟Literally “you are having need of” milk, notSome manuscripts have “and not” solid food.

13. For everyone who partakes of milk is unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.

14. But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil.   

## Hebrews 6

1.  A Serious Warning Against Falling Away Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,

2. teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.

3. And this we will do, if God permits.

4. For it is impossible concerning those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit,

5. and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,

6. and having fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, because theyHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“have crucified again”) which is understood as causal have crucified again for themselves the Son of God and held him up to contempt.

7. For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those people ⌞for whose sake⌟Literally “for the sake of whom” it is also cultivated, shares a blessing from God.

8. But if itHere “if” is supplied as a component of the participle (“produces”) which is understood as conditional produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to a curse, whose end is for burning. 

9. But even if we are speaking in this way, dear friends, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and belonging to salvation.

10. For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name byHere “by” is supplied as a component of the participle (“having served”) which is understood as means having served the saints, and continuing to serve them.

11. And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end,

12. in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.  

13.  The Reliability of God’s Promise For whenHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“made a promise”) God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself,

14. saying,  “Surely ⌞I will greatly bless⌟Literally “blessing I will bless” you, and ⌞I will greatly multiply⌟Literally “multiplying I will multiply” you.”  

15. And so, byHere “by” is supplied as a component of the participle (“persevering”) which is understood as means persevering, he obtained the promise.

16. For people swear by what is greater than themselves, and the oath for confirmation is the end of all dispute for them.

17. In the same way God, because heHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“wanted”) which is understood as causal wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve, guaranteed it with an oath,

18. in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us,

19. which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain,

20. where Jesus, the forerunner for us, entered, because heHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“became”) which is understood as causal became a high priest ⌞forever⌟Literally “to the age” according to the order of Melchizedek.   

## Hebrews 7

1.  The Greatness of Melchizedek For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham as heHere “as” is supplied as a component of the participle (“was returning”) which is understood as temporal was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,This verse contains a number of quotations from Gen 14:17–19

2. to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everythingA quotation from Gen 14:20—in the first place, his name is translated “king of righteousness,” and then also “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace”;

3. without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time. 

4. But see how great this man was, to whom AbrahamSome manuscripts have “even Abraham” the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils!

5. And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although ⌞they are descended from Abraham⌟Literally “coming forth from the loins of Abraham”.

6. But the one who did not trace his descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.

7. Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent.

8. And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives.

9. And, ⌞so to speak⌟Literally “as if to say a word”, even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham.

10. For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.  

11.  The Superiority of Jesus to Melchizedek Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron?

12. For whenHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (“changes”) the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also.

13. For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar.

14. For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.

15. And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises,

16. who has become a priest not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.

17. For it is testified,  “You are a priest ⌞forever⌟Literally “for the age” according to the order of Melchizedek.”A quotation from Ps 110:4 (see also Heb 5:6; 6:20)  

18. For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness

19. (for the law made nothing perfect), but on the other hand there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God.

20. And by as much as this was not without an oath (for these on the one hand ⌞have become priests⌟Literally “are having become priests” without an oath,

21. but he with an oath by the one who said to him,  “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest ⌞forever⌟Literally “for the age”’ ”A quotation from Ps 110:4 (see also Heb 5:6; 6:20; 7:17)),  

22. by so much moreSome manuscripts have “so much more also” Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. 

23. And indeed many ⌞have become⌟Literally “are having become” priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,

24. but he, because he continues ⌞forever⌟Literally “for the age”, holds the priesthood permanently.

25. Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, because heHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“lives”) which is understood as causal always lives in order to intercede on their behalf. 

26. For a high priest such as this indeed is fitting for us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become exalted above the heavens,

27. who does not ⌞need every day⌟Literally “have necessity every day” like the former high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did this once for all when heHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“offered up”) offered up himself.

28. For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the statement of the oath, after the law, appoints a Son, who is made perfect ⌞forever⌟Literally “for the age”.   

## Hebrews 8

1.  The Mediator of a New and Better Covenant Now this is the main point in what has been said: we have a high priest such as this, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,

2. a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, not man.

3. For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it wasOr “it is”; either a present or a past tense verb may be supplied here necessary for this one also to have something that he offers.

4. Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because thereHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“are”) which is understood as causal are those who offer the gifts according to the law,

5. who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when heHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“about”) was about to complete the tabernacle, for he says, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.”A quotation from Exod 25:40

6. But now he has attained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises.

7. For if that first covenant had been faultless, occasion would not have been sought for a second.

8. For in finding fault with them he says,  “Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, 

9. not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day I took hold of them by my hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant and I disregarded them, says the Lord. 

10. For this is the covenant that I will decree with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I am putting my laws in their minds and I will write them on their hearts, and I will be ⌞their⌟Literally “to them for” God and they will be ⌞my⌟Literally “to me for” people. 

11. And they will not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. 

12. For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings, and I will not remember their sins any longer.”  

13. In calling it new, he has declared the former to be old. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is near to disappearing.   

## Hebrews 9

1.  The Earthly Ministry of the Old Covenant NowSome manuscripts have “Now even” the first covenant had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary.

2. For a tent was prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place.

3. And after the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies,

4. containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which were a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant.

5. And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, about which it is not now possible to speak in detail. 

6. Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent ⌞continually⌟Literally “throughout all” as theyHere “as” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“accomplish”) accomplish their service,

7. but only the high priest enters into the second tent once a year, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the sins of the people committed in ignorance.

8. The Holy Spirit was making this clear, that the way into the holy place was not yet revealed, whileHere “while” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“was”) the first tent was still in existence,

9. which was a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience,

10. concerning instead only food and drink and different washings, regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting things right.  

11.  The Heavenly Ministry of the New Covenant But Christ has arrived as a high priest of the good things to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,

12. and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the most holy place, obtaining eternal redemption.

13. For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh,

14. how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God? 

15. And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, becauseHere “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“has taken place”) which is understood as causal a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.

16. For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established.

17. For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive.

18. Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood.

19. For whenHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“had been spoken”) every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calvesSome manuscripts have “calves and goats” with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,

20. saying,  “This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.”A quotation from Exod 24:8  

21. And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood.

22. Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 

23. Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.

24. For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,

25. and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary ⌞year by year⌟Literally “according to year” with blood not his own,

26. since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself.

27. And ⌞just as⌟Literally “in as much as” it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,

28. thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation.   

## Hebrews 10

1.  Christ’s One Sacrifice for Sin For the law, possessing a shadow of the good things that are about to come, not the form of things itself, is never able ⌞year by year⌟Literally “according to year” by means of the same sacrifices which they offer without interruption to make perfect those who draw near.

2. For otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who worship, having been purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?

3. But in them there is a reminder of sins ⌞year by year⌟Literally “according to year”.

4. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 

5. Therefore, when heHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“came”) came into the world, he said,  “Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but a body you prepared for me; 

6. you did not delight in whole burnt offerings and offerings for sins. 

7. Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come— in the roll of the book it is written about me— to do your will, O God.’  

8. When he says above,  “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin you did not want, nor did you delight in,”Various phrases from the quotation of Ps 40:6 in Heb 10:5–6 are repeated here  which are offered according to the law,

9. then he has said,  “Behold, I have come to do your will.”A repetition of Ps 40:8 from Heb 10:7; many later manuscripts add “O God,” making the quotation conform to Heb 10:7 more closely  He takes away the first in order to establish the second,

10. by which will we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 

11. And every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices many times, which are never able to take away sins.

12. But this one, after heHere “after” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“had offered”) had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,

13. from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.

14. For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy.

15. And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying, 

16.  “This is the covenant that I will decree for them after those days, says the Lord: I am putting my laws on their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.”A quotation from Jer 31:33  

17. He also says,  “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again.”A quotation from Jer 31:34

2. fixing our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

3. For consider the one who endured such hostility by sinners against himself,The plural reflexive pronoun can still be translated as singular; see Louw-Nida 92.25 so that you will not grow weary in your souls and give up.

9. Furthermore, we have had ⌞our earthly fathers⌟Literally “the flesh of our fathers” who disciplined us, and we respected them. Will we not much rather subject ourselves to the Father of spirits and live?

10. For they disciplined us for a few days according to what seemed appropriate to them, but he does so for our benefit, in order that we can have a share in his holiness.

13. and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be dislocated, but rather be healed.

14. Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.

17. For you know that also afterwards, when heHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“wanted”) wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he did not find an occasion for repentance, although he sought it with tears.

24. and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and ⌞to the sprinkled blood⌟Literally “to the blood of sprinkling” that speaks better than Abel’s does. 

25. Watch out that you do not refuse the one who is speaking! For if those did not escape when theyHere “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal participle (“refused”) refused the one who warned them on earth, much less will we escape,Here the verb “will … escape” is an understood repetition from the previous clause if weHere “if” is supplied as a component of the participle (“reject”) which is understood as conditional reject the one who warns from heaven,

26. whose voice shook the earth at that time, but now he has promised, saying,  “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”A quotation from Hag 2:6

28. Therefore, since weHere “since” is supplied as a component of the participle (“are receiving”) which is understood as causal are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us be thankful, through which let us serve God acceptably, with awe and reverence.

29. For indeed our God is a consuming fire.

15. Therefore through him let us offer up a sacrifice of praise ⌞continually⌟Literally “through all” to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.

19. And I especially urge you to do this, so that I may be restored to you more quickly.
