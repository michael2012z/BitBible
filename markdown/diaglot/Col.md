## Colossians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Anointed through will of God, and Timothy the brother, Colossians

2. to those in Colosse to holy ones and to faithful ones brethren in Anointed; favor to you and peace from God a Father of us.

3. We give thanks to the God and Father of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed always concerning you praying,

4. having heard the faith of you in Anointed Jesus, and the love that for all the holy ones,

5. through the hope that being laid up for you in the heavens, which you before heard in the word of the truth of the glad tidings,

6. of that being present among you, as also in all the world, and is bringing forth fruit and growing, as also in you, from which day you heard and acknowledged the favor of the God in truth;

7. as even you learned from Epaphras the beloved fellowservant of us, who is faithful on behalf of you a servant of the Anointed;

8. who also having related to us the of you love in spirit.

9. Because of this also we, from which day we heard, not we cease on behalf of you praying, and asking, that you may be filled the exact knowledge of the will of him in all wisdom and understanding spiritual;

10. to walk worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, in every work good bringing forth fruit and growing in the exact knowledge of the God;

11. with all strength being strengthened according to the power of the glory of him, for all patience and endurance with joy;

12. giving thanks to the Father to that having fitted us for the portion of the inheritance of the holy ones in the light;

13. who delivered us from the authority of the darkness, and caused a change of sides for the kingdom of the son of the love of himself;

14. in whom we have the redemption the forgiveness of the sins;

15. who is a likeness of the God of that unseen, firstborn of every creation; Colossians

16. because in him were created the things all, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, the things seen and the things unseen, whether thrones, or lordships, or governments, or authorities; the things all on account of him and for him have been created;

17. and he is in advance of all, and the things all in him has been placed together; Colossians

18. and he is the head of the body, of the congregation; who is a beginning, firstborn out of the dead ones, so that he might become among all himself preeminent;

19. because in him it was thought good all the fulness to inhabit,

20. and by means of him to reconcile the things all to him, having made peace by means of the blood of the cross of him, by means of him, whether the things on the earth, or the things in the heavens.

21. Even you, once being aliens and enemies in the mind by the works those wicked, now indeed he reconciled,

22. in the body of the flesh of himself by means of the death, to present you holy ones and blameless ones and irreproachable ones in presence of him;

23. if indeed you continue in the faith having been grounded and settled ones, and not being moved away from the hope of the glad tidings of which you heard, of that having been published in all the creation that under the heaven; of which became I Paul a servant.

24. Now I rejoice in the sufferings on behalf of you, and I fill up the wants of the afflictions of the Anointed one in the flesh of me on behalf of the body of him, which is the congregation;

25. of which became I a servant according to the stewardship of the God that having been given to me for you, to fully set forth the word of the God,

26. the secret that having been hid from the ages and from the generations, now but was manifested to the holy ones of him;

27. to whom wished the God to make known, what the wealth of the glory of the secret of this among the nations, who is Anointed in you, the hope of the glory;

28. whom we announce, admonishing every man, and teaching, every man with all wisdom, so that we may present man perfect in Anointed;

29. for which also I labor, ardently contending according to the strongworking of him that working strongly in me in power.

## Colossians 2

1. I wish for you to know, how great a conflict I have concerning you and those in Laodicea, and as many as not have seen the face of me in flesh;

2. so that may be comforted the hearts of them, being knit together in love and for all wealth of the full conviction of the understanding, in order to an exact knowledge of the secret of the God;

3. in which are all the treasures of the wisdom and of the knowledge stored up. Colossians

4. This but I say, that not any one you may deceive with plausible speech. Colossians

5. If for even in the flesh I am absent, still in the spirit with you I am, rejoicing and beholding of you the order, and the stability of the in Anointed faith of you.

6. As therefore you received the Anointed Jesus the Lord, in him walk you, Colossians

7. having been rooted and being build up in him, and being established in the faith, as you were taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.

8. See you, not any one you shall be the making a prey by means of the philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of the men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Anointed.

9. Because in him dwells all the fulness of the deity bodily,

10. and you are by him having been filled; who is the head of all governments and authority;

11. in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Anointed,

12. having been buried with him by the dipping; in which also you were raised by means of the faith of the strong working of the God of that one having raised him out of dead ones;

13. and you, dead being in the faults and by the uncircumcision of the flesh of you, he made alive together with him, having freely forgiven us all the faults;

14. having blotted out that against us written by hand in the ordinances, which was contrary to us, and it he has removed out of the midst, having nailed it to the cross;

15. having stripped off the governments and the authorities, he made a show by publicity, having triumphed over them in it.

16. Not therefore any one you let judge in food or in drink, or in respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths;

17. which are a shadow of the things about coming, the but body of Anointed. Colossians

18. No one you let deprive of the prize, wishing by humility of mind and a religious worship of the messengers, what things not he has seen prying into, without cause being puffed up by the mind of the flesh of himself,

19. and not holding firmly the head, from whom all the body, by means of the joints and ligaments being served and being compacted, grows the growth of the God.

20. If you died with Anointed from the elements of the world, why as living in world do you impose on yourselves ordinances;

21. (not thou shouldst have touched, nor thou shouldst have tasted, nor thou shouldst have handled?

22. which is all for corruption in the using,) according to the commands and teachings of the men; which things is a wordy show indeed having of wisdom in selfdevised worship and humility and nonindulgence of body, not in honor any, for a filling up of the flesh.

## Colossians 3

1. If then you were raised with the Anointed, the things above seek you, where the Anointed is at right of the God sitting;

2. the things above mind you, not the things on the earth.

3. You did for, and the life of you has been hidden with the Anointed by the God; Colossians

4. when the Anointed may appear, the life of us, then also you with him shall appear in glory.

5. Put you to death therefore the members of you those on the earth, fornication, impurity, passion, desire evil, and the covetousness, which is idol worship;

6. because of which things comes the wrath of the God on the sons of the disobedience;

7. in which things also you walked once, when you were living among them; Colossians

8. now but put off also you the things all, anger, wrath, malice, evil speaking, filthy words out of the mouth of you;

9. not speak you falsely to each other; having stripped the old man with the practices of him,

10. and having put on the new, that being renewed by exact knowledge according to an image of the one having created him;

11. where not exists Greek and Jew; circumcision and uncircumcision; barbarian, Scythian; slave, freeman; but the things all and in all Anointed.

12. Be you clothed therefore, as chosen ones of God holy ones and beloved ones, bowels of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patient endurance;

13. (bearing with each other, and freely forgiving each other, if any one for some things should have a cause of complaint; as even the Anointed freely forgave you, so also you;)

14. besides all and these the love, which is a bond of the completeness;

15. and the peace of the Anointed one let preside in the hearts of you, for which also you were called in one body; and thankful ones become you.

16. The word of the Anointed let dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching, and admonishing each other in psalms and in hymns and in songs spiritual, with favor singing in the hearts of you to the God;

17. and every thing, whatever you may do, in word or in work, all in name of Lord Jesus, giving thanks to the God and Father through him.

18. The wives, submit yourselves to the husbands, as it has been proper in Lord. Colossians

19. The husbands, love you the wives, and not be you embittered against them. Colossians

20. The children, be you subject to the parents in all things; this for is wellpleasing in Lord.

21. The fathers, not do you provoke the children of you, so that not they may be discouraged.

22. The slaves, be you subject in all things to the according to flesh lords, not with service of eyes, as menpleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord;

23. and every thing, whatever you may do, from soul work you, as to the Lord and not to men.

24. Knowing, that from Lord you will receive the recompence of the inheritance, the for Lord Anointed you serve.

25. He but doing wrong will receive back what he did wrong; and not is respect of persons.

## Colossians 4

1. The lords, the just and the equal to the slaves render you, knowing, that also you have a Lord in heavens.

2. To the prayer attend you constantly, watching in it, with thankfulness; Colossians

3. praying at the same time also for us, that the God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Anointed, on account of which even I have been bound; Colossians

4. so that I may make manifest it, as it behooves me to speak.

5. In wisdom walk you towards those outside, the season buying for yourselves.

6. The word of you always with favor, with salt having been seasoned, to have known how it behooves you one each to answer.

7. The things concerning me all will make known to you Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellowslave in Lord;

8. whom I sent to you for it this thing, that he may know the things concerning you, and may comfort the hearts of you;

9. with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is from you; all to you they will make known the things here.

10. Salutes you Aristarchus the fellowcaptive of me, and Mark the nephew of Barnabas, concerning whom you received commands; (of he should come to you, receive him;) Colossians

11. and Jesus he being called Justus; they being of circumcision; these alone fellowworkers for the kingdom of the God, who were to me a comfort.

12. Salutes you Epaphras, he from you a slave of Anointed, always fervently striving on behalf of you in the prayers, that you may stand perfect even having been completed in all will of the God.

13. I testify for to him, that he has great concern on behalf of you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.

15. Salute you those in Laodicea brethren, and Nymphas, and the in house of him congregation.

16. And when may have been read among you the letter, make you, that also in the Laodiceans congregation it may be read, and that from Laodicea that also you may read. Colossians

17. And say you to Archippus: See the service which thou didst receive in Lord, that her thou mayest fulfil.

18. The salvation in the my hand of Paul. Remember you of me the chains. The favor with you.
