## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God a Father of us and Lord Jesus Anointed;

2. favor to you and peace from God a Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed.

3. To give thanks we are bound to the God always concerning you, brethren, as proper it is, because is growing fast the faith of you, and abounds the love of one of each of all of you for each other;

4. so that us ourselves in you to boast among the congregation of the God, on account of the patience of you and of faith, in all the persecutions of you and the afflictions, which you endure;

5. a token of the righteous judgment of the God, for that to be deemed worthy you of the kingdom of the God, on behalf of which also you suffer.

6. If indeed a just thing with God, to give in return to those afflicting you affliction,

7. and to you to those being afflicted a relaxation with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with messengers of power of himself,

8. in a fire of flame, executing retributive justice to those not knowing God, and to those not being obedient to the glad tidings of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed;

9. who a just penalty shall pay, destruction agelasting, from face to the Lord and from the glory of the strength of him,

10. when he may come to be glorified in the holy ones of himself and to be admired in all those having believed, (because was believed the testimony of us to you,) in the day that.

11. For which also we pray always concerning you, that you may be counted worthy of the calling the God of us, and may fill up every good intention of goodness and work of faith in power;

12. so that may be glorified the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed in you, and you in him, according to the favor of the God of us and Lord Jesus Anointed.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. We entreat and you, brethren, concerning the presence of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, and of us assembling to him,

2. in order that not quickly to be shaken you from the mind, nor to be alarmed neither by a spirit, nor by a word, nor by a letter as by means of us, as that has come close the day of the Lord.

3. No one you should delude by any turn; because, if not may come the falling away first, and may be revealed the man of the sin, the son of the destruction,

4. he opposing and lifting up himself above all being called a god or an august object, so that him into the temple of the God to be seated, openly showing himself, that he is a god.

5. Not remember you, that still being with you, these things I said to you?

6. and now the restraining thing you know, in order that to be revealed him in the of himself season.

7. The for secret thing already works of the lawlessness, only the one restraining now till out of midst it may be;

8. and then will be revealed the lawless one; whom the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of the mouth of himself, and will make powerless by the appearing of the presence of himself;

9. of whom in the presence, according to an energy of the adversary, with all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,

10. and with every deception of the iniquity, in those perishing; because as the love of the truth not they received in order that to be saved them.

11. And because of this will send to them the God a strong working of deceit, in order that to believe them the falsehood;

12. so that may be judged all those not having believed the truth, but having delighted in the iniquity.

13. We but are bound to give thanks to the God always concerning you, brethren being beloved by Lord, because chose you the God from a beginning for salvation in sanctification of spirit and belief of truth;

14. into which he called you by means of the glad tidings of us, for obtaining glory of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.

15. So then, brethren, stand you, and hold you fast the traditions, which you were taught, whether through a word or by a letter of us.

16. Himself but the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, and the God and Father of us he having loved us and having given a consolation agelasting and a hope good by favor,

17. may comfort of you the hearts, and may establish you in every word and work good.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. The remainder, pray you, brethren, for of us, that the word of the Lord may run and may be glorified, as even among you,

2. and that we may be delivered from the out of place and evil men; not for of all the faith.

3. Faithful but is the Lord, who will establish you and will guard from the evil one.

4. We have confidence but in Lord concerning you, because the things we announce to you, both you do and will do.

5. The but Lord may direct of you the hearts into the love of the God, and into the patience of the Anointed.

6. We give orders but to you, brethren, in name of the Lord of us of Jesus Anointed, to withdraw you from every brother disorderly walking, and not according to the tradition, which they received from us.

7. Yourselves for know, now it behooves to imitate us; because not we were disorderly among you,

8. neither gratuitously bread did we eat from any one, but in toil and weariness, night and day working, in order that not to burden any of you.

9. Not because not we have authority, but that ourselves a pattern we might give to you for the to imitate us.

10. Indeed for, when we were with you, this we announced to you, that if any one not wishes to work, neither let him eat.

11. We hear for some are walking, among you out of order, nothing working, but being above work.

12. To the now such like we command and we exhort through the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, that with quietness working the of themselves bread they may eat.

13. You but, brethren, not should be remiss doing well.

14. If but any one not hearkens to the word of us by means of the letter, him point you out; and not mix you together with him, so that he may be put to shame;

15. and not as an enemy regard you, but admonish you as a brother.

16. Himself but the Lord of the peace may give to you the peace always in every way; the Lord with all of you.

17. The salutation by the my hand of Paul, which is a sign in every letter, thus I write;

18. the favor of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with all of you. So be it.
