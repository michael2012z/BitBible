# Acts

## Acts 1

1. The indeed first account I made concerning all things, O Theophilus, which began the Jesus to do and also to teach,

2. even to which day, having given charge to the apostles, through spirit holy whom he chose, he was taken up.

3. To whom also he presented himself living after the to suffer him, in many clear proofs, through days forty being seen by them, and saying the things concerning the kingdom of the God.

4. And assembling them he command them, from Jerusalem not to depart, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me;

5. that John indeed dipped in water, you but shall be dipped in spirit holy, not after many these days.

6. They indeed therefore having come together, asked him; saying: O lord, if in the time this thou restorest the kingdom to the Israel?

7. He said and to them: Not for you it is to know times or seasons, which the Father placed in the own authority.

8. But you shall receive power having come the holy spirit upon you; and you shall be to me witnesses in both Jerusalem, and in all the Judea and in Samaria, and even to farthest part of the land.

9. And these things having said, beholding of them he was lifted up; and a cloud withdrew him from the eyes of them.

10. And as fixedly gazing they were into the heaven, going away of him, and lo, men two were standing by them in raiment white,

11. they and said: Men of Galilee, why stand you looking into the heaven? this the Jesus, he being taken up from you into the heaven, thus will come, which manner you saw him going into the heaven.

12. Then they returned into Jerusalem from a mountain that being called of olivetrees, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath being distant journey.

13. And when they came into, they went up into the upper room, where were remaining, the, both Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alpheus also Simon the zealot and Judas of James.

14. These all were being constantly engaged with one mind in the prayer, with women, and Mary the mother of the Jesus, and with the brothers of him.

15. And in the days these having stood up Peter in middle of the disciples, he said: (was and a crowd of names, in the same about a hundred twenty;)

16. Men brethren, it was necessary to be fulfilled the writing this, which spoke before the spirit the holy through mouth of David, about Judas that having become a guide to those having seized the Jesus;

17. because having been numbered he was among us, and obtained the lot of the service this.

18. This indeed therefore bought a field out of a reward of the wickedness; and headforemost having fallen, he burst in middle, and were poured out all the bowels of him;

19. and known became to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, so as to be called the field that in the own language of them, Aceldama, this is, a field of blood.

20. It is written for in book of psalms: Let be the dwelling of him desolate, and not let be the dwelling in her; and, The charge of him let take another.

21. It is necessary therefore of those having associated with us men in all time, in which went in and went out among us the Lord Jesus,

22. beginning from the dipping of John to the day which he was taken up from us, a witness of the resurrection of him to become with us one of these.

23. And they set forth two, Joseph that being call Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And praying they said: Thou, O Lord, heartknower of all, show which thou didst select out of these the two one,

25. to take the lot of the service this and apostleship, from which stepped aside Judas, to go into the place the own.

26. And they gave lots of them; and fell the lot on Matthias, and he was counted with the eleven apostles.

## Acts 2

1. And in the to be fully come the day of the Pentecost, were all with one mind in the same.

2. And were suddenly from the heaven a sound as of a rushing wind violent, and it filled whole the house, were they were sitting;

3. and they saw with them being divided tongues like fire; sat and on one each one of them,

4. and they were filled all spirit holy, and they began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave to them to speak.

5. Were now in Jerusalem dwelling Jews, men pious, from every nation of those under the heaven.

6. Having happened and the sound this, came together the multitude, and were perplexed; because heard one each in the own language speaking of them.

7. Were astonished and all and wondered, saying to each other: Not lo all these are who are speaking Galileans?

8. And how we hear each one in the own language of us, in which we were born,

9. Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those dwelling the Mesopotamia, Judea both and Cappadocia, Pontus and the Asia,

10. Phrygia both and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of the Lybia that upon Cyrene, and those sojourning Romans, Jews both and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabians, we hear speaking them in the our tongues the great things of the God?

12. Were astonished and all and perplexed, one to another saying: What will this to be?

13. Others but deriding said: That sweet wine having been filled they are.

14. Standing up but Peter with the eleven, lifted up the voice of himself, and said to them: Men Jews, and those dwelling in Jerusalem all, this to you known let be, and listen you the words of me.

15. Not for, as you suppose, these are drunk; it is for hour third of the day;

16. but this is that having been spoken through the prophet Joel:

17. And it shall be in the last the days, say the God, I will pour out from of the spirit of me upon all flesh; and shall prophesy the sons of you and the daughters of you, and the young men of you visions shall see, and the old men of you dreams shall dream;

18. and even on the maleslaves of me and on the femaleslaves of me in the days those I will pour out from of the spirit of me, and they shall prophesy.

19. And I will give prodigies in the heaven above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and a cloud of smoke;

20. the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, sooner than to come the day of Lord the great and illustrations.

21. And it shall be, every one who may call upon the name of Lord, shall be saved.

22. Men Israelites, hear you the words these: Jesus the Nazarene, a man from the God having been pointed out to you by mighty works and prodigies and signs, (which did through him the God in midst of you, as also yourselves you know,)

23. this by the having been fixed purpose and foreknowledge of the God given up having been taken, by hands of lawless ones having affixed to you killed.

24. Whom the God raised up; having loosed the pains of the death, in as much as not was possible to be held him under it.

25. David for says concerning him: I saw the Lord in presence of me always, because at right hand of he is, so that not I may be shaken.

26. Through this rejoiced the heart of me, and exulted the tongue of me; moreover and also the flesh of me will repose in hope;

27. because not thou will abandon the life of me to invisibility, nor thou wilt abandon the holy one of thee to see corruption.

28. Thou didst make known to me ways of life; thou will fill me of joy with the face of thee.

29. Men brethren, it is lawful to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that both he died and was buried, and the tomb of him is among us till of the day this.

30. A prophet there being, and knowing that with an oath swore to him the God, out of fruit of the loins of him to cause to sit on the throne of him,

31. foreseeing he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Anointed, that not he was abandoned into invisibility, nor the flesh of him saw corruption.

32. This the Jesus raised up the God, of which all we are witnesses.

33. To the right hand therefore of the God having been exalted, the and promise of the holy spirit having received from the Father, he poured out this, which you see and hear.

34. Not for David ascended into the heavens; he says but himself: Said the Lord to the lord of me: Sit thou at right hand of me,

35. till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool for the feet of thee.

36. Certainly therefore let know all house of Israel, that both Lord him and Anointed the God made, this the Jesus, whom you crucified.

37. Having heard and they were pierced to the heart, said and to the Peter and the other apostles: What shall we do, men brethren?

38. Peter and said to them: Reform you, and be dipped each one of you in the name of Jesus Anointed, for forgiveness of sins, and you shall receive the gifts of the holy spirit.

39. To you for is the promise and to the children of you, and to all those at a distance as many as may call Lord the God of us.

40. Other and words with many he testified, and exhorted, saying: Be saved from the generation of the perverse this.

41. They indeed therefore gladly having received the word of him, were dipped; and were added the day that souls about three thousand.

42. Were and constantly attending to the teachings of the apostles, and to the distribution, and to the breaking of the loaf, and to the prayers.

43. Came and to every soul fear, many and prodigies and signs through the apostles were done.

44. All and those believing were in the same, and had all things common,

45. and the possessions and the goods they were selling; and they were dividing them to all, as any one need had.

46. Every day and constantly attending with one mind in the temple, breaking and at home bread, they were partaking of food in gladness and singleness of heart,

47. praising the God, and having favor with whole the people. The and Lord was adding those being saved everyday to the congregation.

## Acts 3

1. In the same now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of the prayer the ninth.

2. And a certain man lame from womb of mother of himself being, was being carried; whom they placed every day at the door of the temple that being called beautiful, the to ask alms from those entering into the temple.

3. Who seeing Peter and John being about to go into the temple, asked alms to receive.

4. Looking steadily and Peter on him with the John, said: Look on us.

5. He and gave heed to them, expecting something from them to receive.

6. Said and Peter: Silver and gold not are possessed by me; what but I have, this to thee I give. In the name of Jesus Anointed the Nazarene do thou arise and walk.

7. And having taken him the right hand he rose up; immediately and were strengthened of him the feet and the anklebones.

8. And leaping up he stood, and walked; and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, and praising the God.

9. And saw him all the people walking and praising the God;

10. they knew and him, that he was who for the alms sitting at the beautiful gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that having happened to him.

11. Holding fast and of him the Peter and John, ran together to them all the people to the porch that being called of Solomon, awestruck.

12. Seeing and Peter answered to the people: Men Israelites, why do you wonder at this? or to us why look you earnestly, as by own power or piety having been made of the to walk him?

13. The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of the fathers of us, glorified the servant of himself Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up, and denied him in face of Pilate, having judged he to release.

14. You but the holy and righteous denied, and asked a man a murderer to be granted to you,

15. the and prince of the life you killed; whom the God raised out of dead ones, of whom we witnesses are;

16. and by the faith of the name of him, this whom you behold and know, strengthened the name of him; and the faith that through him gave to him the perfect soundness this in presence of all of you.

17. And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance you did, as also the rulers of you.

18. The but God what he foretold through mouth of all of the prophets of himself, to suffer the Anointed, he fulfilled thus.

19. Reform you therefore and turn you, in order that the to be wiped out of you the sins, that may come seasons of refreshing from face of the Lord,

20. and he may send him having been before destined for you Jesus Anointed;

21. whom must heaven indeed to receive till time of restoration of all things, which spoke the God through mouth of the holy of himself prophets from an age.

22. Moses indeed to the fathers said: That a prophet to you shall raise up Lord the God of you, from of the brethren of you; like me; of him you shall hear in all things, which he may speak to you.

23. It shall be and, every soul whatever not may hear the prophet that, shall be destroyed out of the people.

24. Also all and the prophets from Samuel and those succeeding as many as spoke also told of the days these.

25. You are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant, which ratified the God to the fathers of us, saying to Abraham: And in the seed of thee shall be blessed all the families of the earth.

26. To you first the God, having raised up the servant of himself, sent him blessing you, in the to turn each one from the evil deeds of you.

## Acts 4

1. Speaking and of them to the people, and came upon them the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees,

2. being grieved through the to teach them the people, and to announce in the Jesus the resurrection that out of dead ones.

3. And they laid on them the hands, and put into keeping to the morrow; it was for evening now.

4. Many but of those having heard the word believed; and became the number of the men about thousand five.

5. It happened and on the morrow to be assembled of them the rulers and elders and scribes at Jerusalem;

6. also Annas the highpriest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of highpriesthood.

7. And having placed them in middle they asked: By what power, or in what name did this you?

8. Then Peter being filled with spirit holy, said to them: Rulers of the people, and elders of the Israel,

9. if we today be examined to for kindness a man sick, by what he has been saved.

10. Known be it all to you and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Anointed the Nazarene, whom you crucified whom the God raised out of the dead ones, by him this has stood in presence of you sound.

11. This is the stone that having been despised by you the builders, the having been made into a head of a corner.

12. And not is in another to any one the salvation; not even for a name is another under the heaven, that having been given among men, in which must to be saved us.

13. Seeing and the of the Peter boldness and of John, and having perceived, that men unlearned they are and ungifted, they wondered, they knew and them, that with the Jesus they were;

14. the and man beholding with them standing that having been healed, nothing they had to say against.

15. Having ordered and them outside of the highcouncil to go, they consulted with each other,

16. saying: What shall we do to the men these? that indeed for known a sign has been done by them, to all those dwelling in Jerusalem manifest, and not we were able to deny.

17. But that not to more it may spread among the people, with a threat let us threaten them, no longer to speak in the name this to any man.

18. And having called them, they charged them not at all not to speak nor to teach in the name of the Jesus.

19. The but Peter and John answering to them said: If just it is in presence of the God, you to hearken rather than the God, judge you.

20. Not are able for we, what we saw and heard, not to speak.

21. They and having again threatened them dismissed them, nothing finding the how they might punish them, on account of the people; because all glorified the God on account of that having been done.

22. Years for was more forty the man; on whom was wrought the sign this of the cure.

23. Having been dismissed and they came to the own friends, and related what things to them the highpriests and the elders said.

24. They and having heard, with one mind lifted up a voice to the God, and said: O Sovereign, thou the God, that having made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the things in them;

25. who through mouth of David a servant of thee having said: Why raged nations, and peoples devised vain things?

26. Stood up the kings of the earth, and the rulers were assembled in the same, against the Lord, and against the Anointed of him.

27. Were gathered for in truth in the city this against the holy servant of thee Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, Herod both and Pontius Pilate, with Gentiles and peoples of Israel,

28. to do what things the hand of thee and the will of thee before marked out to be done.

29. And now, O Lord, look thou upon the treats of them, and grant to the slaves of thee, with freedom all to speak the word of thee,

30. in the the hand of thee to stretch out thee for healing, and signs and prodigies to do through the name of the holy child of thee Jesus.

31. And having prayed of them was shaken the place, in which they were assembled; and they were filled all of a spirit holy, and spoke the word of the God with freedom.

32. Of the and multitude of those having believed was the heart and the soul one; and not even one any of the possessions of him said his own to be, but was to them all things common.

33. And with great power the testimony the apostles of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; favor and great was on all them.

34. Not even for the poor any one was among them; such as for owners of lands or houses were, were selling bringing the prices of those being sold,

35. and were placing at the feet of the apostles; it was divided and to each one, according as might one need have.

36. Joses and, he being surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, (which is being translated, a son of exhortation,) a Levite, a Cyprian by the birth,

37. having to him a field, having sold brought the price, and placed at the feet of the apostles.

## Acts 5

1. A man but certain Ananias by name, with Sapphira the wife of himself, sold a possession;

2. and kept back from the price, being privy also the wife of him; and having brought a part certain, at the feet of the apostles placed.

3. Said and Peter: Ananias, why has filled the adversary the heart of thee, to deceive thee the spirit the holy, and to keep back from the price of the land?

4. Not remaining, to thee it remained, and having been sold, in the thine authority it was? why that hast thou placed in the heart of thee the thing this? not thou hast lied to men, but to the God.

5. Having heard and the Ananias the words these, falling down breathed out. And came a fear great on all those having heard these.

6. Having arisen and the younger ones wrapped up him, and having carried out they buried.

7. It happened and about hours three apart, and the wife of him not having known that having been done came in.

8. Answered and to her the Peter: Tell me, if for so much the land you sold? She and said: Yes for so much.

9. The and Peter said to her: Why that it has been agreed upon by you to tempt the spirit of Lord? Lo the feet of those having buried the husband of thee, at the door, and they will carry out thee.

10. She fell and immediately at the feet of him, and breathed out; having come in and the younger ones found her dead, and having carried out they buried with the husband of her.

11. And came a fear great on whole the assembly, and on all those having heard these things.

12. Through and the hands of the apostles were done signs and prodigies among the people many; and they were with one mind all in the portico of Solomon;

13. of the and others no one presumed to join himself to them. But magnified them the people;

14. (more and were added believing to the Lord multitudes of men both and women;)

15. so that in the open squares to bring out the sick ones, and to place on beds and couches, that coming of Peter if even the shadow might overshadow some of them.

16. Came together and also the multitude from the surrounding cities into Jerusalem, bringing sick ones and those being troubled by spirits impure; whom were healed all.

17. Having arisen and the high priest and all those with him, the being sect of the Sadducees, were filled of anger.

18. And laid the hands of them on the apostles, and placed them in prison public.

19. A messenger but of a Lord by the night opened the doors of the prison, having brought out and them said:

20. Go, and standing speak you in the temple to the people all the words of the life this.

21. Having heard and they entered at the dawn into the temple, and taught. Having come and the highpriest and those with him, they called together the high council even all the senate of the sons of Israel, and sent into the prison, to have brought them.

22. The but officers having gone not found them in the prison; having returned and reported,

23. saying: That the indeed prison we found having been closed with all safety, and the guards standing before the doors; having opened but, within no one we found.

24. When and they heard the words these the, both priest and the commander of the temple and the highpriests, they doubted concerning them, what might be this.

25. Having come but one told them: That lo, the men whom you put in the prison, are in the temple standing and teaching the people.

26. Then having gone the commander with the officers, they brought them, not with violence; they feared for the people, that not they might be stoned.

27. Having brought and them they stood in the sanhedrim. And asked them the highpriest,

28. saying: Not with a charge we charged you, not to teach in the name this? and lo, you have filled the Jerusalem of the teaching of you, and you wish to bring on us the blood of the man this.

29. Answering and the Peter and the apostles, said: To obey it is necessary God rather than men.

30. The God of the fathers of us raised up Jesus, whom you laid violent hands upon, having hanged on a cross;

31. him the God a prince and a savior has lifted up to the right hand of himself, to give reformation to the Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

32. And we are of him witnesses of the matters these, and the spirit also the holy, which gave the God to those submitting to him.

33. They and having heard were enraged, and took counsel to kill them.

34. Having arisen and one in the high council a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel a teacher of law, honored by all the people, ordered without a little while the apostles to be put.

35. He said and to them: Men Israelites, take heed to yourselves, to the men these, what you are about to do.

36. Before for these the days stood up Theudas, saying to be some one himself, to whom adhered a number of men about four hundred; who was put to death, and all as many as listened to him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.

37. After this stood up Judas the Galilean, in the days of the registering, and drew away people much behind himself; and he was destroyed, and all as many as listened to him, were dispersed.

38. And now I say to you, withdraw from the men these, and let alone them, because if may be from men the counsel this or the work this, it will be overthrown;

39. if but from God it is, not you are able to overthrow them, not and fighters against God you should be found.

40. They were persuaded and by him; and having called the apostles, having beaten they commanded not to speak in the name of the Jesus, and released them.

41. They indeed therefore went rejoicing from presence of the highcouncil, because in behalf of the name they were accounted worthy to be dishonored.

42. Every and day in the temple and at home not they ceased teaching and announcing glad tidings of Jesus the Anointed.

## Acts 6

1. In and the days those increasing the disciples, came a murmuring of the Hellenists to the Hebrews, because were overlooked in the service the daily the widows of them.

2. Having called and the twelve the multitude of the disciples, said: Not proper it is us having left the word of the God, to serve tables.

3. Look you out therefore, brethren, men from of you being attested seven, full of spirit and wisdom, whom we will appoint to the need this;

4. we but to the prayer and to the service of the word will constantly attend.

5. And pleased the word in presence of all of the multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and spirit holy, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch;

6. whom they placed in presence of the apostles; and having prayed they put to them the hands.

7. And the word of the God grew, and was multiplied the number of the disciples in Jerusalem greatly; great and a crowd of the priests were obedient to the faith.

8. Stephen and full of favor and of power performed prodigies and signs great among the people.

9. Stood up and some of those from the synagogue of that being called of Libertines, and of Cyrenians, and of Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, disputing with the Stephen;

10. and not were able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke.

11. Then they thrust under men, saying: That we have heard him speaking words blasphemous against Moses and the God.

12. They stirred up and the people and the elders and the scribes, and having come upon they seized him, and led into the high council,

13. stood up and witnesses false, saying: The man this not ceases words speaking against the place of the holy and the law.

14. We have heard for him saying: That Jesus the Nazarene this will destroy the place this, and will change the customs, which delivered to us Moses.

15. And having gazed on him all those being seated in the highcouncil, saw the face of him like a face of a messenger.

## Acts 7

1. Said and the highpriest: If then these things thus are?

2. He and said: Men brethren and fathers, hear you. The God of the glory appeared to the father of us Abraham being in the Mesopotamia, before to dwell him in Charran.

3. And said to him: Go out from the land of thee, and from the kindred of thee, and come into a land, which to thee I may show.

4. Then going out from land of Chaldeans, he dwelt in Charran; and thence, after the to have died the father of him, he caused to remove him into the land this, in which you now dwell;

5. and not he gave to him inheritance in her, not even a footbreadth; and he promised to him to give for a possession her, and to the seed of him after him, not being to him a child.

6. Spoke and thus the God: That shall be the seed of him a stranger in a land foreign, and they will enslave it and they will oppress years fourhundred;

7. and the nation, to which they may be enslaved, will judge I, said the God; and after these things they shall come out, and shall render service to me in the place this.

8. And he gave to him a covenant of circumcision; and thus he begot the Isaac, and circumcised him the day the eighth; and the Isaac the Jacob, and the Jacob the twelve patriarchs.

9. And the patriarchs envying the Joseph sold into Egypt; and was the God with him,

10. and delivered him out of all of the afflictions of him, and gave to him favor and wisdom in presence of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and placed him ruling over Egypt and whole the house of himself.

11. Came and a famine on whole the land of Egypt and Canaan, and affliction great; and not found provisions of fathers of us.

12. Having heard and Jacob being grain in Egypt, he sent the fathers of us first.

13. And in the second was made known Joseph to the brothers of himself, and shown became to the Pharaoh the family of the Joseph.

14. Having sent and Joseph called for the father of himself Jacob, and all the kindred, in souls seventyfive.

15. Went down and Jacob into Egypt, and died he and the fathers of us.

16. And they were carried into Sychem, and were placed in the tomb, which bought Abraham for a price of silver from the sons of Emmor of the Sychem.

17. When but drew near the time of the promise, which swore the God to the Abraham, grew the people and were multiplied in Egypt;

18. till for whom stood up a king another, who not knew the Joseph.

19. This having dealt deceitfully the family of us, illtreated the fathers of us, of the to cause to be exposed the babes of them; in order that not they might be preserved.

20. In which season was born Moses, and was beautiful to the God; who was nursed months three in the house of the father.

21. Having exposed and him, took up him the daughter of Pharaoh, and nursed him herself for a son.

22. And was taught Moses in all wisdom of Egyptians; was and powerful in words and in works of himself.

23. When but was completed to him forty years of time, it came up in the heart of him to visit the brethren of himself, the sons of Israel.

24. And seeing one being wronged, he defended, and did justice to him being oppressed, having smitten the Egyptian.

25. He thought and to understand the brethren of himself, that the God by hands of him gives to them salvation; they but not understood.

26. In the but next day he appeared to those contending, and urged them to peace, saying: Men, brethren are you; why wrong you each other?

27. He but wronging the neighbor, thrust away him, saying: Who thee has appointed a ruler and a judge over us?

28. Not to kill me thou wishest, in which manner thou didst kill yesterday the Egyptian?

29. Fled and Moses at the word this, and became a sojourner in land of Midian, where he begot sons two.

30. And being completed years forty, appeared to him in the desert of the mountain Sinai a messenger of Lord in a flame of fire of a bush.

31. The but Moses having seen admired the sight; coming near and of him to observe, came a voice of Lord to him:

32. I the God of the fathers of thee, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Terrified and being Moses not dared to look.

33. Said and to him the Lord: Loose the sandals of the feet of thee; the for place in which thou standest, ground holy is.

34. Having seen I saw the evil treatment of the people of me of that in Egypt, and the groaning of them I have heard, and am come down to deliver them; and now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

35. This the Moses whom they denied, saying: Who thee appointed a ruler and a judge? this the God a ruler and a redeemer sent by hand of a messenger of that having appeared to him in the bush.

36. This led out them, having done prodigies and signs in the Egypt, and in red sea, and in the desert, years forty.

37. This is the Moses, he saying to the sons of Israel: A prophet for you will raise up Lord the God from of the brethren of you, like me; him you shall hear.

38. This is he being, in the congregation in the desert, with the messenger that speaking to him in the mountain Sinai and of the fathers of us, who received oracles living to give to us;

39. to whom not were willing obedient to become the fathers of us, but thrust away, and turned back in the hearts of them into Egypt,

40. saying to the Aaron: Make for us gods, who shall go before us; the for Moses this who led out us from land Egypt, not we know what has happened to him.

41. And they made a calf in the days those, and offered a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of the hands of them.

42. Turned and the God, and gave up them to serve the host of the heaven; as it is written in book of the prophets: Not victims and sacrifices did you offer to me forty in the desert, house of Israel?

43. And you took up the tabernacle of the Moloch and star of the god of you Remphan, the images, which you made to worship them; and I will cause to remove you beyond Babylon.

44. The tabernacle of the testimony was with the fathers of us in the desert, as directed he speaking to the Moses, to make her according to the form which he had seen;

45. which also brought having received by succession the fathers of us with Jesus in to the possession of the nations, which drove out the God from face of the fathers of us, till the days of David;

46. who found favor in presence of the God, and asked to find a dwelling for the God of Jacob.

47. Solomon but built for him a house.

48. But not the Most High in hand made things dwells, as the prophet says:

49. The heaven to me a throne, the and earth a footstool of the feet of me. What house will you build for me? says Lord; or what place of the dwelling of me?

50. Not the hand of me made these things all?

51. O stiffnecked, and uncircumcised in the heart and the ears; you always the spirit the holy fight against, like the fathers of you also you.

52. Which of the prophets not persecuted the fathers of you? and they killed those having foretold concerning the coming of the righteous, of whom now you betrayers and murderers have become;

53. who received the law by injunctions of messengers, and not you kept.

54. Having heard and these things, they were enraged through the hearts of them, and gnashed the teeth of him.

55. Being but full of spirit holy, having gazed intently into the heaven, he saw glory of God, and Jesus having stood at right of the God,

56. and said: Lo, I see the heavens having been opened, and the son of the man at right having stood of the God.

57. Having cried and with a voice loud, they shut up the ears of them, and they ran with one mind on him;

58. and having cast outside the city, they stoned. And the witnesses laid down the mantles of them at the feet of a young man being called Saul,

59. and they stoned the Stephen, calling upon and saying:L O Lord Jesus, do thou receive the breath of me.

60. Having placed and the knees he cried out with a voice loud: O Lord, not thou mayest place to them the sin this. And this having said, he fell asleep.

## Acts 8

1. Saul and was concerning to the death of him. Was and in that the day a persecution great against the congregation that in Jerusalem; all and were scattered in the regions of the Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. Buried and the Stephen men pious, and they made lamentation great for him.

3. Saul but was outraging the congregation, into the houses entering, dragging and men and women, was delivering up into prison;

4. they indeed therefore having been scattered wandered about, preaching glad tidings the word.

5. Philip and going down into a city of the Samaria, proclaimed to them the Anointed.

6. Assented and the crowds to the things being spoken by the Philip with one mind, in the to hear them and to see the signs which he did.

7. Many for of those possessing spirits unclean, crying with a voice loud came out; many and having been praised and lame were cured.

8. And was joy great in the city that.

9. A man but certain, by name Simon, formerly in the city, practising magic, and amazing the nation of the Samaria, saying to be somebody himself great;

10. to whom they assented all from least to greatest, saying: This is the power of the God which is being called great.

11. They attended and to him, because that for a long time with the magic arts to have amazed them.

12. When but they believed the Philip announcing glad tidings the things concerning the kingdom of the God and the name of Jesus Anointed, they were dipped men both and women.

13. The and Simon and himself believed, and having been dipped he was constantly attending to the Philip; beholding and miracles and signs great being done, he was amazed.

14. Having heard and the in Jerusalem apostles, that had received the Samaria the word of the God, they sent to them the Peter and John;

15. who having gone down offered prayer concerning them, so that they might receive spirit holy.

16. (Not yet for it was on any one of them having fallen, only but having been dipped they were into the name of the Lord Jesus.)

17. Then they placed the hands on them, and they received spirit holy.

18. Having seen and the Simon, that through the placing of the hands of the apostles was given the spirit the holy, he offered to them money,

19. saying: Give you also to me the authority this, that to whom ever I may place the hands, they may receive spirit holy.

20. Peter but said to him: The silver of thee with thee may be into destruction, because the gift of the God thou hast thought with money to buy.

21. Not is to thee a part nor lot in the word this; the for heart of thee not is right before the God.

22. Do thou reform therefore from the wickedness of thee this, and entreat of the God, if indeed may be forgiven to thee the thought of the heart of thee.

23. In for a gall of bitterness and a bond of wickedness I see thee being.

24. Answering and the Simon said: Entreat you in behalf of me to the Lord, that nothing may come on me of which you have spoken.

25. They indeed therefore having earnestly testified and having spoken the word of the Lord, turned back for Jerusalem, many and villages of the Samaritans announced glad tidings.

26. A messenger and of a Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Do thou arise, and go towards south, in the way that leading down from Jerusalem to Gaza; this is desert.

27. And having arisen he went; and lo, a man of Ethiopia a eunuch, a grandee of Candace of the queen of Ethiopians, who was over all the treasure of her; who had come worshipping to Jerusalem,

28. was and returning and sitting in the chariot of himself, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.

29. Said and the spirit to the Philip: Go thou near, and be joined to the chariot this.

30. Running to and the Philip heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said: Truly understandest thou, what thou readest?

31. He but said: How for should I be able, if not some one should guide me? He called and the Philip, having gone up to sit with him.

32. The and portion of the writing, which he was reading, was this: As a sheep to slaughter was led, and as a lamb before the one shearing him is dumb, so not he opens the mouth of himself.

33. In the low estate of him the judgment of himself was taken away; the and generation of him who shall declare? because is taken away from the earth the life of him.

34. Answering but the eunuch to the Philip, said: I beseech thee, concerning whom the prophet says this? concerning himself, or concerning another one?

35. Having opened and the Philip the mouth of himself, and having begun from the writing this, announced glad tidings to him the Jesus.

36. As and they were going in the way, they came to a certain water, and said the eunuch: Lo, water; what hinders me to be dipped?

37. And he ordered to stand the chariot; and they went down both into the water the, both Philip and the eunuch; and he dipped him.

38. When and they came up out of the water, spirit of Lord seized the Philip; and now saw him no longer the eunuch; he went for the way of himself rejoicing.

39. Philip but found into Azotus; and passing through he announced glad tidings the cities all, till of the to come him into Caesarea.

## Acts 9

1. The and Saul still breathing of threatening and slaughter towards the disciples of the Lord, coming to the highpriest,

2. he desired from him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if any he might find of the way being, men both and women, having been bound he might lead into Jerusalem.

3. In and the to go, came him to draw near to the Damascus; and suddenly flashed around him a light from the heaven;

4. and having fallen to the earth, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul; Why dost thou persecute?

5. He said and: Who art thou, O Lord? The and Lord said: I am Jesus; whom thou persecutest;

6. but stand thou up and enter into the city, and it shall be told to thee what thee it is necessary to do.

7. The and men those traveling with him, stood dumb, hearing indeed the voice, no one but seeing.

8. Arose and the Saul from the earth; having been opened and the eyes of him, no one he saw; leading by the hand and him they led into Damascus;

9. and he was days three not seeing; and not ate, nor drank.

10. Was and a certain disciple in Damascus by name Ananias, and said to him the Lord in a vision: Ananias. He and said: Lo I, O Lord.

11. The and Lord to him: Having arisen go thou to the street that being called Straight, and seek for in house of Judas, Saul by name, of Tarsus; lo for he prays,

12. and saw in a vision a man by name Ananias, having come in and having placed to him a hand, that he might receive sight.

13. Answered and Ananias: O Lord, I have heard from many concerning the man this, what things bad he did to the saints of thee in Jerusalem.

14. And here he has authority from the highpriests, to bind all those calling upon the name of thee.

15. Said and to him the Lord: Go thou, because a vessel chosen to me is this, of the to bear the name of me before nations, and kings, sons and of Israel.

16. I for will point out to him, what things it behooves him in behalf of the name of me to suffer.

17. Went away and Ananias and entered into the house; and having placed on him the hands, he said: Saul O brother, the Lord has sent me, (Jesus he having appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest,) that thou mayest receive sight, and mayest be filled of spirit holy.

18. And immediately fell from the eyes of him as it were scales, he recovered sight and; and having arisen he was dipped.

19. And having taken food he was strengthened. He was and with the in Damascus disciples days several.

20. And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Jesus, that this is the son of the God.

21. Were amazed and all those having heard, and said: Not this is the one having wasted in Jerusalem those calling upon the name this? and here for this had come, that having bound them he might lead to the highpriests.

22. Saul but more was strengthened, and perplexed the Jews those dwelling in Damascus, proving, that this is the Anointed.

23. When and were fulfilled days many, consulted together the Jews to kill him;

24. was made known but to the Saul the plot of them; they were watching and the gates day both and night, that him they might kill.

25. Having taken but him the disciples by night, they let down through the wall, lowering in a basket.

26. Having come and into Jerusalem, he tried to unite himself to the disciples; and all feared him; not believing that he is a disciple.

27. Barnabas but having taken him, brought to the apostles, and related to them, how in the way he saw the Lord, and that he spoke to him, and how in Damascus he spoke boldly in the name of the Jesus.

28. And he was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.

29. He spoke and and contended with the Hellenists; they but took in hand him to kill.

30. Having known but the brethren they brought down him to Caesarea, and sent away him into Tarsus.

31. The indeed then congregations in whole of the Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up and proceeding in the fear of the Lord and the consolation of the holy spirit, were multiplied.

32. It happened and Peter, passing through all, to have gone down also to the saints those dwelling Lydda.

33. He found and there a man certain Eneas by name, from years eight being laid in bed, who was a paralytic.

34. And said to him the Peter: Eneas, cures thee Jesus the Anointed; arise thou, and make the bed for thyself. And immediately he arose.

35. And saw him all those dwelling Lydda and the Saron, who turned to the Lord.

36. In Joppa and certain was a female disciple by name Tabitha, which being translated is called Dorcas; she was full of good works and of alms which she did.

37. It happened and in the days those having been sick her to have died; having washed and her they laid in an upper room.

38. Near and being Lydda to the Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in her, sent two men to him, entreating not to delay to come over to them.

39. Having arisen and Peter came with them; whom having come they laid into the upper room, and stood beside him all the widows weeping, and showing tunics and mantles, as many as she made with them being the Dorcas.

40. Having put and out all the Peter having placed the knees he prayed; and having turned to the body, said: Tabitha, do thou arise. She and opened the eyes of herself; and seeing the Peter, sat up.

41. Having given and to her a hand, he raised her; having called and the saints and the widows, he presented her living.

42. Known and it became in whole of the Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.

43. It happened and days many to remain him in Joppa, with one Simon a tanner.

## Acts 10

1. A man and certain in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion of a cohort that being called Italian,

2. pious and fearing the God with all the house of himself, doing and alms many to the people, and praying of the God always;

3. he saw in a vision clearly, about hour ninth of the day, a messenger of the God having come to him, and saying to him: O Cornelius.

4. He and having looked steadily to him and afraid becoming, he said: What is it, O sir? He said and to him: The prayers of thee and the alms of thee went up for a memorial before the God.

5. And now send into Joppa men, and send after Simon, who is surnamed Peter,

6. he lodges with one Simon a tanner, to whom is a house by sea.

7. When and went away the messenger, that speaking to him, having called two of the house servants of himself, and a soldier pious of those constantly attending him,

8. and having related to them all things, he sent them into the Joppa.

9. On the and morrow, pursuing the journey of them, and to the city drawing near, went up Peter to the roof to pray, about hour sixth.

10. He became and very hungry, and wished to eat; making ready and of them, fell on him a trance,

11. and he beholds the heaven having been opened, and coming down a vessel certain like a sheet great, four ends having bound, and being lowered down to the earth;

12. In which were all the fourfooted beasts of the earth and the wild beasts and the creeping things and the birds of the heaven;

13. and came a voice to him: Having arisen, O Peter, sacrifice and eat.

14. The but Peter said: By no means, O Lord; because never I ate any thing common or unclean.

15. And a voice again a second time to him: What the God has cleansed, thou not pollute.

16. This and was done for three times; and again was taken up the vessel into the heaven.

17. As and in himself was pondering the Peter, what might be the vision which he saw, even lo, the men those being sent from the Cornelius, having inquired for the house of Simon, stood at the gate;

18. and having called aloud they asked, if Simon he being called Peter here lodges.

19. The and Peter reflecting concerning the vision, said to him the spirit: Lo, men three are seeking thee;

20. but having arisen do thou go down, and go with them, nothing doubting because I have sent them.

21. Having gone down but Peter to the men, said: Lo, I am, whom you seek; what the cause, on account of which you are present?

22. They and said: Cornelius a centurion, a man just and fearing the God, being testified of and by whole of the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a messenger holy, to send after thee to the house of himself, and to hear words from thee.

23. Having called in then them he lodged. On the and morrow having arisen he went out with them, and some of the brethren, those from Joppa, went with him.

24. And on the morrow they entered into the Caesarea. The and Cornelius was expecting them, having assembled the relatives of himself and the intimate friends.

25. When and came the to enter the Peter, having met him the Cornelius, having fallen to the feet, he worshipped.

26. The but Peter him raised up, saying: Do thou arise; also I myself a man am.

27. And talking with him, he went in, and finds having been assembled many.

28. He said and to them: You know, how unlawful it is for a man a Jew, to unite or come near to a foreigner; and to me the God has shown, not common or unclean to say a man.

29. Therefore also without hesitation I came having been sent after. I ask therefore, for what reason you sent after me?

30. And the Cornelius said: From four days till this the hour, I was fasting, and the ninth hour praying in the house of me; and lo, a man, stood before me in clothing shining,

31. and he said: O Cornelius, heard of thee the prayer, and the alms of thee are remembered before the God.

32. Send therefore into Joppa, and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in a house of Simon a tanner by sea.; who having come will speak to thee.

33. Immediately therefore I sent to thee; thou and well didst having come. Now therefore all we before the God are present, to hear all the things having been commanded thee by the God.

34. Having opened and Peter the mouth, said: In truth I perceive, that not is a respecter of persons the God;

35. but in every nation he fearing him, and working righteousness, acceptable to him is.

36. The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming glad tidings of peace through Jesus Anointed; this is of all a Lord.

37. You know that having been a spoken word in whole of the Judea beginning from the Galilee, after the dipping which was preached of John;

38. Jesus that from Nazareth, how anointed him the God with spirit holy and power, who went about doing good and curing all those being oppressed by the accuser, because the God was with him;

39. and we witnesses of all, which he did in both the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom also they killed having hanged on a cross.

40. This the God raised up the third day, and gave him manifest to become,

41. not to all the people, but to witnesses to those having been chosen before by the God, to us, who ate with and drank with him after that to have raised him out of the dead ones.

42. And he commanded us, to publish to the people and to fully testify that he is the having been appointed by the God a judge of living ones and of dead ones.

43. To him all the prophets bear testimony, forgiveness of sins to receive through the name of him every one the believing into him.

44. While speaking the Peter the words these, fell the spirit the holy on all those hearing the word.

45. And were astonished those of circumcision believers as many as came with the Peter, because also on the Gentiles the gift of the holy spirit has been poured out;

46. they heard for them speaking with tongues, and magnifying the God. Then answered the Peter:

47. Not the water to forbid is able any that not to be dipped these, who the spirit the holy received as even we?

48. He directed and them to be dipped in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain days some.

## Acts 11

1. Heard and the apostles and the brethren those being in the Judea, that also the gentiles received the word of the God.

2. And when went up Peter into Jerusalem, disputed with him those of circumcision,

3. saying: That to men uncircumcision having thou wentest in, and thou didst eat with them.

4. Having begun and the Peter set forth to them in order, saying:

5. I was in city of Joppa praying; and I saw in a trance a vision, coming down a vessel certain like a sheet great, four ends being lowered out of the heaven, and came as far as me;

6. into which having looked I observed and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the heaven.

7. I heard and a voice saying to me: Having arisen, O Peter, sacrifice and eat.

8. I said but: But no means, O Lord; because common or unclean never entered into the mouth of me.

9. Answered but to me a voice a second time out of the heaven: What the God cleansed, thou not pollute.

10. This and was done for three times; and again was drawn up all into the heaven.

11. And lo, immediately three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.

12. Said and to me the spirit, to go with them, nothing doubting; went and with me also the six brethren these, and we entered into the house of the man.

13. He related and to us, how he saw the messenger in the house of himself standing and saying to him: Send into Joppa, and send after Simon that having been surnamed Peter;

14. who will speak words to thee, by which mayest be saved thou and all the house of thee.

15. In and the to have begun me to speak, fell the spirit the holy on them, as also on us in beginning.

16. I remembered and the words of the Lord, how he said: John indeed dipped in water, you but shall be dipped in spirit holy.

17. If then the like gift gave to them the God as even to us, having believed on the Lord Jesus Anointed, I and who was, having power to restrain the God?

18. Having heard and these, they were silent, and glorified the God, saying: Then also to the Gentiles the God the reformation gave into life.

19. Those indeed therefore having been scattered from the affliction that having happened about Stephen, went through to Phenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, not speaking the word if not alone to Jews.

20. Were and some of them men Cyprians and Cyrenians, who having come into Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, announcing glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.

21. And was hand of Lord with them, great and number having believed turned to the Lord.

22. Was reported and the word into the ears of the congregation that in Jerusalem concerning them; and they sent out Barnabas to go through to Antioch.

23. Who having come and having seen the favor of the God, rejoiced, and called on all, with the purpose of the heart to adhere to the Lord;

24. for he was a man good, and full of spirit holy and faith. And was added a crowd great to the Lord.

25. Went out and into Tarsus the Barnabas, to seek Saul; and having found him, he brought him to Antioch.

26. It happened and them a year whole to assemble in the congregation, and to teach a crowd great, to have been styled and first in Antioch the disciples Christians.

27. In these and the days came down from Jerusalem prophets into Antioch.

28. Having arisen and one of them, by name Agabus, signified through the spirit, a famine great about is going to be over whole the habitable; which also occurred under Claudius.

29. The and disciples as was able each, determined each one of them for a relief to send to the dwelling in the Judea brethren;

30. which also they did, sending to the elders through hand of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. In that and the season put forth Herod the king the hands, to afflict some of the from of the congregation,

2. he killed and James, the brother of John, with a sword.

3. And having seen, that pleasing it is to the Jews, he proceeded to take also Peter; (they were and the days of the unleavened cakes);

4. whom also having seized he placed into a prison, having delivered to four sets of four soldiers to watch him, intending after the passover to lead out him to the people.

5. The indeed therefore Peter was watched by the guard; prayer but was earnest was made by the congregation to the God in behalf of him.

6. When but was about him to bring before the Herod, in the night that was the Peter sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with chains two, guards and before the door watching the prison.

7. And lo, a messenger of Lord stood by, and a light shone in the building; having struck and the side of the Peter, aroused him, saying: Arise in haste. And fell off of him the chains from the hands.

8. Said and the messenger to him: Grid thyself, and bind under the sandals of thee. He did and so. And he says to him: Throw around the mantle of thee, and follow me.

9. And having gone out he followed him, and not knew, that real it is that being done through the messenger, thought but a vision to see.

10. Passing through and first guard and second, they came to the gate the iron that leading into the city, which selfmoved opened to them; and having gone out went forward street one, and immediately stood the messenger from him.

11. And the Peter having come in to himself, said: Now I know really, that sent forth Lord the messenger of himself, and delivered me out of hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

12. Considering and he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, that being surnamed Mark, where were many assembled and were praying.

13. Having knocked and him the door of the gateway, came a female servant to listen, by name Rhoda;

14. and knowing the voice of the Peter, from the joy not she opened the gate; having run in and told, to have stood the Peter before the gate.

15. They but to her said: Thou art mad. She but confidently affirmed thus to be.

16. They and said: The messenger of him it is. The but Peter continued knocking; having opened and they saw him, and were amazed.

17. Having waved but to them the hand to be silent, he related to them, how the Lord him led out of the prison. Said and: Report you to James and to the brethren these things. And going out he went into another place.

18. Having become and day, was a stir not small among the soldiers, what then the Peter was become.

19. Herod and having sought him, and not having found, having examined the guards, commanded to be led off; and going down from the Judea into the Caesarea he remained.

20. He was and being enraged with Tyrians and Sidonians; with one mind but was present with him, and having persuaded Blastus, that over the bedchamber of the king, desired peace; because that to be nourished of them the country from of the king.

21. On a set and day the Herod having put on apparel royal, and having sat down on the throne, made a speech to them.

22. The but people shouted: Of a god voice, and not of a man.

23. Immediately and struck him a messenger of Lord, because not he gave glory to the God; and being eaten of worms, he breathed out.

24. The and word of the God grew and was multiplied.

25. Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having fulfilled the service, having brought along also John that having been surnamed Mark.

## Acts 13

1. Were and some in Antioch in the being congregation prophets and teachers, the both Barnabas and Simon that being called Black, and Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen also, of Herod the tetrarch a foster brother, and Saul.

2. Serving and of them the Lord and fasting, said the spirit the holy: Separate you indeed for me the Barnabas and the Saul for the work, which I have called them.

3. Then having fasted and having prayed, and having laid the hands to them, they sent forth.

4. These indeed then having been sent forth by the spirit the holy, went down into the Seleucia, thence and sailed into the Cyprus.

5. And having arrived in Salamis, they announced the word of the God in the synagogues of the Jews; they had and also John an attendant.

6. Having gone through and whole the island to Paphos, they found a certain magian, a false prophet a Jew, to whom a name BarJesus,

7. who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a man intelligent. This having summoned Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of the God.

8. Stood against but them Elymas the magian, (thus for it translated the name of him,) seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.

9. Saul but (he also Paul) being filled of spirit holy, and having looked earnestly on him,

10. said: O full of all deceit and of all ready working, O son of an accuser, enemy of all righteousness, not wilt thou cease perverting the ways of Lord the straight?

11. And now lo, a hand of Lord on thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun till a season. Immediately and fell on him a mist and darkness; and going about he sought guides.

12. Then seeing the proconsul that having been done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

13. Having set sail and from the Paphos those about the Paul, came into Perga of the Pamphylia. John but, having gone away from them, returned into Jerusalem.

14. They and having passed through from the Perga went to Antioch of the Pisidia, and having entered into the synagogue in the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.

15. After and the reading of the law and the prophets, sent the synagoguerulers to them, saying: Men brethren, if is a word in you of consolation to the people, say you.

16. Having stood up and Paul, and having waved the hand, said: Men Israelites, and those fearing the God, hear you.

17. The God of the people this chose the fathers of you; and the people exalted in the sojourning in land of Egypt, and with an arm lifted up be brought them out of her;

18. and about forty years time he nourished them in the desert;

19. and having cast out nations seven in land of Canaan, he distributed by lot to them the land of them.

20. And after these things about years four hundred and fifty he gave judges, till Samuel the prophet.

21. And then they asked for a king, and gave to them the God the Saul son of Kish, a man of tribe of Benjamin, years forty.

22. And having removed him, he raised up to them the David for a king, to whom also he said having testified: I found David, that of the Jesse, a man according to the heart of me, who will do all the will of me.

23. This the God from the seed according to promise brought forth to the Israel a savior Jesus,

24. having announced before of John before face of the entrance of him a dipping of reformation to all the people Israel.

25. As and was fulfilling the John the race, he said: Who me do you suppose to be? not am I, but lo, comes after me, of whom not I am worthy the sandal of the feet to loose.

26. Men brethren, sons race of Abraham, and those among you fearing the God, to you the word of the salvation this is sent.

27. Those for dwelling in Jerusalem, and the rulers of them, him not knowing, and the voices of the prophets those in every sabbath being read, judging fulfilled.

28. And no one cause of death having found, they asked Pilate to kill him.

29. When and they finished all the things concerning him having been written, having taken down from the cross, they placed in a tomb.

30. The but God raised him out of dead ones,

31. who appeared on days many to those having gone up with him from of the Galilee into Jerusalem, who are witnesses of him to the people.

32. And we you address with glad tidings that to the fathers promise having been made, that this the God has fulfilled to the children of them to us, having raised up Jesus;

33. as also in the first psalm it is written: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee.

34. Because and he raised him out of dead ones, no more being about to return to corruption, thus he said: That I will give to you the holy things of David the faithful.

35. Therefore also in another he says: Not thou wilt permit the holy one of thee to see corruption.

36. David indeed for own generation having served by the of the God will fell asleep, and was laid with the fathers of himself and saw corruption;

37. whom but the God raised up, not saw corruption.

38. Know therefore let it be to you, men brethren, that through this to you forgiveness of sins is announced;

39. and from all things, which not you are able by the law of Moses to be justified in him every one the believing is justified.

40. See then, not may come upon you that having been spoken by the prophets;

41. behold you the despisers, and wonder you, and disappear you; because a work I work in the days of you, a work, which not not you would believe, if one should narrate to you.

42. Having gone out and of them, they desired on the next sabbath to be spoken to them the words these.

43. Being broken up and the synagogue, followed many of the Jews and of the worshiping proselytes the Paul and the Barnabas; who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the favor of the God.

44. On the and coming sabbath, almost all the city came together to hear the word of the God.

45. Seeing and the Jews the crowds, they were filled of zeal, and spoke against the things by the Paul being spoken, contradicting and blaspheming.

46. Speaking freely and the Paul and the Barnabas said: To you it was necessary first to be spoken the word of the God; since but you trust away him, and not worthy judge yourselves of the agelasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

47. Thus for has commanded us the Lord: I have set thee for a light of nations, the to be thee for salvation to end of the earth.

48. Having heard and the Gentiles rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord; and believed as many as were having been disposed for life agelasting.

49. Was published and the word of the Lord through whole of the country.

50. The but Jews stirred up the religious women the honorable, and the chiefs of the city, and raised a persecution against the Paul and the Barnabas, and cast out them from the borders of them.

51. They but having shaken off the dust of the feet of them against them, came into Iconium.

52. The and disciples were filled joy and spirit holy.

## Acts 14

1. It happened and in Iconium, at the same to enter them into the synagogue of the Jews, and to speak so, that to believe of Jews and also Greeks a great multitude.

2. The but unbelieving Jews stirred up and imbittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brethren.

3. Considerable indeed then time they remained speaking freely about the Lord, that testifying to the word of the favor of himself, granting signs and prodigies to be done through the hands of them.

4. Was divided and the multitude of the city and these indeed were with the Jews, those and with the apostles.

5. As and was a rush of the Gentiles and also of Jews with the rulers of them, to insult and to stone them,

6. seeing they fled into the cities of the Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country;

7. and there they were preaching glad tidings.

8. And a certain man in Lystra unable in the feet was sitting, lame from womb of mother of himself, who never had walked about.

9. This heard the Paul speaking; who having looked intently to him, and seeing that faith has of the to be saved,

10. said loud with the voice: Do thou stand upon the feet of the erect. And he leaped up, and walked about.

11. The and crowds, seeing what did the Paul, lifted up the voice of them, in Lycaonian language saying: The gods being like men came down to us.

12. They called and indeed Barnabas, Jupiter; the and Paul, Mercury; because he was the leader of the word.

13. The and priest of the Jupiter of that being before the city, bulls and garlands to the gates having brought, with the crowds wished to sacrifice.

14. Having heard and the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having rent the mantles of them, rushed out into the crowd, crying out,

15. and saying: Men, why these things do you? also we being like are to you men, announcing glad tidings you from these the superstitions to turn to the God the living, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the things in them;

16. who in the having gone by generations permitted all the nations to go in the ways of themselves.

17. Although indeed not without witness himself left, doing good, from heaven to you rains giving and seasons fruitful, being full of food and of joy the hearts of you.

18. And these things saying, hardly they restrained the crowds the not to sacrifice to them.

19. Came and from Antioch and Iconium Jews; and having persuaded the crowds, and having stoned the Paul, they dragged outside of the city, supposing him to be dead.

20. Surrounding and him the disciples, having arisen entered into the city. And on the morrow he went with the Barnabas into Derbe.

21. Having preached glad tidings and the city that, and having made disciples many, they returned to the Lystra and Iconium and Antioch;

22. confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to abide in the faith, and that through many afflictions it behooves us to enter into the kingdom of the God.

23. Having appointed and for them elders in every congregation, having prayed with fasting they commended them to the Lord, into whom they had believed.

24. And having passed through the Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia;

25. and having spoken in Perga the word, they went down into Attalia;

26. and thence they sailed into Antioch, whence they were having been commended to the favor of the God for the work, which they fulfilled.

27. Having arrived and and having assembled the congregation, they related what things did the God with them, and that he opened to the Gentiles a door of faith.

28. They remained and a time not a little with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. And some having come down from the Judea, were teaching the brethren: That if not you are circumcised with the rite of Moses not you are able to be saved.

2. Being therefore a dispute and discussion not a little the Paul and the Barnabas with them, they decided to send up Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, about the question this.

3. They indeed therefore having been sent forward by the congregation, passed through the Phenicia and Samaria, narrating the turning of the Gentiles; and caused joy great to all the brethren.

4. Having come and into Jerusalem, they were received by the congregation and the apostles and the elders, they related and what things the God did with them.

5. Stood up and some of those from the sect of the Pharisees having believed, saying: That it is necessary to circumcise them, to command and to keep the law of Moses.

6. Assembled and the apostles and the elders to see concerning the word this.

7. Much and debate being, having arisen Peter said to them: Men brethren, you know, that from days former the God among us chose through the mouth of me to hear the Gentiles the word of the glad tidings, and to believe.

8. And the heartknowing God testified to them, giving to them the spirit the holy, as even to us;

9. and nothing judged between us and also them, by the faith having purified the hearts of them.

10. Now therefore why do you tempt the God, to place a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither the fathers of us nor we were able to bear?

11. But through the favor of the Lord Jesus we believe to be saved, in which manner also they.

12. Was silent and all the multitude, and heard Barnabas and Paul narrating, what did the God signs and prodigies among the Gentiles through them.

13. After and the to be silent them, answered James, saying: Men brethren, hear you of me.

14. Simon related, how first the God looked to take out the Gentiles a people for the name of himself.

15. And with this harmonize the words of the prophets, as it is written:

16. After these thing I will return and I will build again the tabernacle of David that having fallen down; and return the ruins of her I will build again, and I will set up her;

17. so that may seek the rest of the men the Lord and all the nations, on whom has been called the name of me over them,

18. says Lord he doing these things known from an age.

19. Therefore I judge not to trouble those from the Gentiles turning to the God;

20. but to send word to them the to abstain from the pollutions of the idols and the fornication and the strangled and the blood.

21. Moses for from generations of old in every city those preaching him has, in the synagogues in every sabbath being read.

22. Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders with whole the congregation, having chosen men out of themselves to send to Antioch with the Paul and Barnabas, Judas that being called Barsabas, and Silas, men leading among the brethren;

23. having written by hand of them thus: The apostles and the elders and the brethren, to those in the Antioch and Syria, and Cilicia brethren, those from Gentiles, health.

24. Since we have heard, that some from us having gone out troubled you with words, unsettling the souls of you, saying to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom not we gave command;

25. it seemed good to us being of one mind, having chosen out men to send to you, with the beloved of us Barnabas and Paul,

26. men having given up the lives of them in behalf of the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.

27. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, and them through word announcing the same things.

28. It seemed good for to the holy spirit and to us, no more to lay to you a burden, besides the necessary things these,

29. to abstain from things offered to idols and blood and strangled and fornication; from which keeping yourselves, well you will do. Farewell.

30. They indeed therefore being dismissed went to Antioch; and having assembled the multitude, delivered the letter.

31. Having read and, they rejoiced at the exhortation.

32. Judas and and Silas, also themselves prophets being, through a word great exhorted the brethren, and confirmed.

33. Having spent and a time, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to those having sent them.

34. It seemed good but to the Silas to remain there.

35. Paul but and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and announcing glad tidings, with also others many, the word of the Lord.

36. After and some days said Paul to Barnabas: Having returned indeed we may visit the brethren in every city, in which we have preached the word of the Lord, how they are.

37. Barnabas and counselled to take with also John that being called Mark.

38. Paul but deemed fitting, the having gone away from them from Pamphylia, and not having gone with them to the work, not to take this.

39. Occurred therefore a sharp contention, so as to separate them from one another, the and Barnabas having taken the Mark sailed to Cyprus.

40. Paul but having selected Silas went out, having been commanded to the favor of the God by the brethren.

41. He passed through and the Syria and Cilicia, confirming the congregations.

## Acts 16

1. He came and to Derbe and Lystra; and lo, a disciple certain was there, by name Timothy, a son of a woman Jew believing, father but a Greek;

2. who was testified to by those in Lystra and Iconium brethren.

3. This wished the Paul with him to go out; and having taken he circumcised him, on account of the Jews those being in the places those; they knew for all the father of him, that a Greek he was.

4. As and they went through the cities, they delivered to them to keep the decrees, those having been determined by the apostles and the elders those in Jerusalem.

5. The indeed then congregations were established in the faith, and were increased in the number every day.

6. Going through and the Phrygia and the Galatia country, being forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in the Asia,

7. coming by the Mysia, they attempted into the Bithynia to go; and not permitted them the spirit of Jesus.

8. Having passed by and the Mysia, they came down to Troas.

9. And a vision in the night was seen by the Paul; a man certain was of Macedonia had been standing, beseeching him, and saying: Having passed over into Macedonia, help thou us.

10. When and the vision he saw, immediately we sought to go out into the Macedonia, inferring that had called to us the Lord to announce glad tidings to them.

11. Having sailed therefore from the Troas we ran a direct course to Samothracia, the and succeeding to Neapolis;

12. thence and to Philippi, which is first of the part that Macedonia, city, a colony. We were and in this the city abiding days some.

13. On the and day of the sabbaths we went out of the city by a river, where was allowed a place of prayer to be, and having sat down we spoke to the having come together women.

14. And a certain woman by name Lydia, a seller of purple of a city of Thyatira worshipping the God, heard; for whom the Lord opened the heart, to attend to those being spoken by the Paul.

15. When and she was dipped, and the house of her, she entreated us, saying: If you have judged me faithful to the Lord to be, having entered into the house of me, abide you. And she forced us.

16. It happened and going of us to a place of prayer, a femaleservant certain having a spirit of Python to meet us, who gain much brought the lords of herself, divining.

17. She having followed closely the Paul and us, cried saying: These the men bondservants of the God the most high are, who are proclaiming to us a way of salvation.

18. This and she did for many days. Being grieved but the Paul, and having turned, to the spirit he said: I command thee in the name of Jesus Anointed, to come out from her. And it came out in that the hour.

19. Seeing and the lords of her, that came out the hope of the gain of them, having taken hold of the Paul and the Silas, they dragged into the market to the rulers;

20. and they having led them to the commanders, said: These the men greatly disturb of us the city, Jews being,

21. and preach customs, which not it is lawful for us to receive, or to do, Romans being.

22. And rose up together the crowd against them, and the commanders having torn off of them the mantles, they ordered to beat with rods;

23. many and having laid on them blows, they cast into prison, having charged the jailor, securely to keep them;

24. who a charge such having received, cast them into the inner prison, and the feet of them were made fast into the stocks.

25. At and the midnight Paul and Silas praying sang a hymn to the God; listened to and them the prisoners.

26. Suddenly and a shaking occurred great, so as to shake the foundations of the prison; were opened and immediately the doors all, and all the bonds were loosed.

27. Out of sleep and having arisen the jailor, and seeing having opened the doors of the prison, having drawn a sword, was about himself to kill, supposing to have been fled the prisoners.

28. Cried out and with a voice loud the Paul, saying: Not thou mayest do to thyself harm, all for we are here.

29. Having asked and lights he rushed in, and terrified having become he fell before the Paul and the Silas.

30. And having led them out, he said: O sirs, what me it behooves to do, that I may be saved?

31. They and said: Believe thou in the Lord Jesus Anointed, and shalt be saved thou and the house of thee.

32. And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all those in the home of him.

33. And having taken them in that the hour of the night, he washed from the stripes; and was dipped he and those of him all immediately.

34. Having led up and them into the house of himself, he set a table, and rejoiced with all his house having believed in the God.

35. Day and having become, sent the commanders the rodbearers, saying: Release thou the men those.

36. Told and the jailor the words these to the Paul: That has sent the commanders, that you may be released; now therefore going out, do you go in peace.

37. The but Paul said to them: Having beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men Romans being, they cast into prison, and now privately us do they cast out? No indeed, but having come themselves us let them lead out.

38. Told and to the commanders the rodbearers the words these; and they were afraid, having heard that Romans they are.

39. And having come they entreated them, and having led out they asked to go out of the city.

40. Having gone and out of the prison they came in to the Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they exhorted them, and went out.

## Acts 17

1. Having passed through and the Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came into Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews.

2. According to and the custom the Paul went in to them, and for sabbaths three reasoned with them from the writings.

3. Opening and setting forth, that the Anointed it was necessary to have suffered and to have been raised out of dead ones, and that this is the Anointed Jesus, whom I announce to you.

4. And some of them were convinced, and joined themselves to the Paul and to the Silas, of the and pious Greeks a great number, women and of the chief not a few.

5. Having taken to themselves and the Jews of the marketloungers some men of evil, and having gathered a crowd, they disturbed the city; having assaulted and the house of Jason, they sought them to led out into the people;

6. not having found and them, they dragged the Jason and some brethren to the cityrulers, crying: That they the habitable having disturbed, these also here are present;

7. whom has received Jason; and these all against the decrees of Caesar do, a king saying another to be, Jesus.

8. Troubled and the crowd and the cityrulers having heard these things.

9. And having taken the security from the Jason and the rest, they let go them.

10. The and brethren immediately by the night sent away the both Paul and the Silas into Berea; who having arrived, into the synagogue of the Jews went.

11. These and were more candid of those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all promptness, that every day closely scrutinizing the writings, if was these things thus.

12. Many indeed therefore out of them believed, and of the Greek women of the honorable and men not a few.

13. When but knew these from Thessalonica Jews, that also in the Berea was preached by the Paul the word of the God, they came also there stirring up the crowds.

14. Immediately and then the Paul sent out the brethren to go as to the sea; remained and the, both Silas and the Timothy there.

15. They but conducting the Paul led him to Athens; and having received a charge to the Silas and Timothy, that as soon as possible they should come to him, they departed.

16. In and the Athens waiting them of the Paul, was stirred up the spirit of him in him, beholding full of idols being the city.

17. He reasoned indeed then in the synagogue with the Jews and with those being pious, and in the market during every day with those happening to meet.

18. Some but of the Epicureans and of the Stoics philosophers encountered him; and some said: What may intend the seedpicker this to say? They said: Of strange demons he seems a proclaimer to be; because the Jesus and the resurrection to them he announced glad tidings.

19. Having taken hold and of him to the Mars hill they led, saying: Are we able to know, what the new this that by thee being spoken teaching?

20. Strange things for certain thou bringest to the ears of us. We desire therefore to know, what may intend these things to be.

21. Athenians and all and the sojourning strangers, in nothing else spend leisure, than to tell something and to hear newer.

22. Having stood up and the Paul in midst of the Mars hill, said: Men Athenians, in all things as it were worshippers of demons you I perceive;

23. passing through for and beholding the objects of worship of you, I found also an altar, in which had been written: To an unknown God. Whom therefore not knowing you worship, this I announce to you.

24. The God that having made the world and all the things in it, this of heaven and earth Lord being not in hand made temples dwells,

25. nor by hands of men is served, wanting anything, he giving to all life and breath and the things all;

26. made and out of one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having fixed having been appointed seasons and the fixed limits of the habitation of them;

27. to seek the God, if indeed they might feel him and might find, and indeed not far from one each of us being.

28. In him for we live and are moved and we are; as also some of those with you poets have said: Of the for also offspring we are.

29. Offspring therefore being of the God, not we are bound to suppose, gold or silver or stone, a sculpture of art and device of man, the Deity to be like.

30. The indeed therefore times of the ignorance overlooking the God, now he commands to the men all in all places to reform;

31. because he established a day, in which he is about to judge the habitable in righteousness, by a man whom he appointed, a guarantee having furnished to all, having raised him out of dead ones.

32. Having heard and a resurrection of dead ones, these indeed mocked; those but said: We will hear thee again about this.

33. And thus the Paul went out from midst of them.

34. Some but men having associated with him, believed; among whom also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.

## Acts 18

1. After and these things having withdrawn the Paul from the Athens, came into Corinth.

2. And having found a certain Jew by name Aquila, Pontus by the race, recently having come from the Italy, and Priscilla wife of him, (because the to have commanded Claudius to withdraw all the Jews from the Rome,) he went to them;

3. and because the same trade to be, he remained with them; and worked; they were for tentmakers the trade.

4. He reasoned and in the synagogue during every sabbath, persuaded and Jews and Greeks.

5. When but came down from the Macedonia the both Silas and the Timothy, was confirmed to the word the Paul, earnestly testifying to the Jews the Anointed Jesus.

6. Resisting but them and blaspheming, having shaken the mantles, he said to them: The blood of you on the head of you, pure I, from the now to the Gentiles I will go.

7. And having removed thence, he went into a house of one by name Justus, worshipping the God, of whom the house was adjoining to the synagogue.

8. Crispus but the synagogueruler believed in the Lord with whole the house of himself; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were dipped;

9. said and the Lord through a vision by night to the Paul: Not fear, but speak and no be silent;

10. because I am with thee, and no one shall attack thee of the to hurt thee; because people is for me much in the city this.

11. He continued and a year and months six, teaching among them the word of the God.

12. Gallio and being proconsul of the Achaia, rushed with one mind the Jews to the Paul, and led him to the tribunal,

13. saying: That from the law this persuades the men to worship the God.

14. being about but the Paul to open the mouth, said the Gallio to the Jews: If indeed therefore it was injustice any, or reckless evil, O Jews, according to reason I would hear with you;

15. if but a question it is about a word and names and of a law of that with you, you will see yourselves; a judge for I of these not choose to be.

16. And he drove them from the tribunal.

17. Having taken hold and all the Greeks of Sosthenes the synagogueruler, they struck before the tribunal; and nothing of these the Gallio cared.

18. The and Paul yet having remained days many, to the brethren having bid farewell, sailed out into the Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shaved the head in Cenchrea; he had for a vow.

19. He came and to Ephesus, and them he left there; he but having entered into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.

20. Asking and them for longer a time to remain with them, not he consented;

21. but he bade farewell to them, saying: It behooves me by all means the feast that coming to keep into Jerusalem; again but I will return to you, the God will. And he sailed from the Ephesus;

22. and having gone down to Caesarea, having gone up, and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch.

23. And having spent time some, he went out, passing through in order, the Galatia country and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples.

24. A Jew and certain Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by the birth, a man eloquent, came to Ephesus powerful being in the writings.

25. This was having been instructed the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning the Lord, being acquainted with only the dipping of John.

26. This and began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Having heard and of him Aquila and Priscilla, took him, and more accurately to him explained the of the God way.

27. Wishing and of him to pass through into the Achaia, having exhorted the brethren they wrote to the disciples to receive him; who having arrived, he helped much those having believed through the grace.

28. Strenuously for with the Jews he was discussing publicly, proving by the writings, to be the Anointed Jesus.

## Acts 19

1. It happened and in the the Apollos to be in Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper parts, to come to Ephesus. And having found some disciples,

2. he said to them: If a spirit holy you received having believed? They and said to him: But not even if a spirit holy is, we have heard.

3. He said and to them: Into what then were you dipped? They and said: Into the of John dipping.

4. Said and Paul: John dipped a dipping of reformation, to the people saying, into him coming after him that they should believe; that is, into the Jesus.

5. Having heard and they were dipped into the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And having placed to them the Paul the hands, come the spirit the holy upon them, they spoke and with tongues and prophesied.

7. Were and the all men about twelve.

8. Having entered and into the synagogue, he spoke freely, for months three reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of the God.

9. When and some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way in presence of the multitude, having departed from them, he separated the disciples, every day reasoning in the school of Tyrannus one.

10. This and was done for years two, so that all the dwellers the Asia to hear the word of the Lord, Jews both and Greeks.

11. Miracles and not the common ones did the through the hands of Paul;

12. so that even to those being sick to be brought from the skin of him napkins or aprons, and to be set free from them the diseases, the and spirits the evil to be cast out.

13. Took in hand and some from those going about Jews exorcists to name on those having the spirits the evil the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I adjure you the Jesus, whom the Paul preaches.

14. Where and some sons of Sceva a Jew a highpriest seven, who this were doing.

15. Answering and the spirit the evil said: The Jesus I know, and the Paul I am acquainted with; you but who are?

16. and leaping on them the man, in whom was the spirit the evil, and having overcome them, prevailed against them, so that naked and having been wounded to have fled out of the house that.

17. This and became known to all Jews both and Greeks those dwelling the Ephesus; and fell a fear on all them, and was magnified the name of the Lord Jesus.

18. Many and of those having believed came confessing and declaring the deeds of them.

19. Many and of those the magical arts practising, having brought together the books, burned in presence of all; and they computed the prices of them, and found pieces of silver myriads five.

20. Thus according to power the word of the Lord grew and prevailed.

21. When and was fulfilled these things, was dipped the Paul in the spirit, having passed through the Macedonia and Achaia, to go into Jerusalem, saying: That after the to be come me there, it behooves me also Rome to see.

22. Having sent and into the Macedonia two of those ministering to him, Timothy and Erastus, he remained a time in the Asia.

23. It happened and during the season that a tumult not small concerning the way.

24. Demetrius for a certain by name, a silversmith, making temples of silver of Diana, brought to the workmen gain not a little.

25. Whom having brought together, and those about the such like workmen, said: Men, you know, that out of this the work the wealth of us is;

26. and you see and you hear, that not only of Ephesus, but almost all the Asia the Paul this having persuaded misled large crowd, saying, that not are gods those by hands being made.

27. Not only and this in danger to us the craft into contempt to come; but also that the great goddess Diana temple into nothing to be despised, to be about and also to be destroyed the magnificence of her, which whole the Asia and the habitable worships.

28. Having heard and, and having become full of wrath, they cried out, saying: Great the Diana of Ephesians.

29. And was filled the city whole the confusion; they rushed and with one mind into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus Macedonians, fellowtravelers of Paul.

30. The and Paul wishing to enter into the assembly of the people, not suffered him the disciples.

31. Some and even of the rulers of Asia being to him friends, having sent to him, besought not to venture himself into the theatre.

32. Some indeed therefore some thing cried; was for the assembly having been confused, and the greater not knew, for what purpose they were come together.

33. Out of and crowd they pushed forward Alexander, thrusting forward him the Jews; the and Alexander having waved the hand, wished to defend himself in the assembly of the people.

34. Knowing but that a Jew he is, voice came one from all, about for hours two crying: Great the Diana of Ephesians.

35. Having stilled and the scribe the crowd, he said: Men Ephesians, what for is man, who not knows the Ephesians city templekeeper being of the great Diana and of that fallen from Jupiter?

36. Cannot be denied therefore being these things, necessary it is you having been quiet to be and nothing rashly to do.

37. You brought for the men these, neither templerobbers, nor blasphemers of the goddess of you.

38. If indeed Demetrius and those with him workmen have against say a word, courts are held, and proconsuls are; let them accuse each other.

39. if but anything other things you inquire, in the lawful assembly it shall be settled.

40. Even for we are in danger to be accused of tumult concerning the day, not one cause being, about which we are able to give a reason far the gathering this.

41. And these having said he dismissed the assembly.

## Acts 20

1. After and the to be restrained the tumult, having called to the Paul the disciples, and having embraced, he went out to go into the Macedonia.

2. Having passed through and the parts those, and having exhorted them with a word great, he went into the Greece;

3. having continued and months three, being formed him a plot against by the Jews, being about to sail into the Syria, came a resolution of the to return through Macedonia.

4. Went with and him as far as the Asia Sopater of Pyrrhus a Berean. Of Thessalonians and, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy; Asiatics and, Tychicus and Trophimus.

5. These going before awaited us in Troas;

6. we but sailed out after the days of the unleavened cakes from Philippi, and came to them into the Troas in days five, where we remained days seven.

7. In and the first of the sabbaths, having been assembled of us to break bread, the Paul discoursed to them, being about to depart on the morrow; continued and the discourse till midnight.

8. Were and lamps many in the upper room, where we were assembled.

9. Sitting and certain youth, by name Eutychus, in the window, being overpowered with sleep deep, discoursing the Paul for a longer time, having been overcome from the sleep, fell from the third story down, and was taken up dead.

10. Having gone down and the Paul fell upon him, and having embraced said: Not be you troubled; the for life of him in him is.

11. Having come up and, and having broken bread and having tasted, for a longer time and having conversed till daybreak, so he departed.

12. They brought and the youth living, and were comforted not a little.

13. We but going before to the ship, sailed to the Assos, there intending to take in again the Paul; so for it was having been arranged, being about himself to go on foot.

14. When and he met with us at the Assos, having again received him we came to Mitylene;

15. and thence having sailed away, on the morrow we came opposite Chios. In the and another we touched at Samos; and having remained in Troyllium, in the following we came to Miletus.

16. Had determined for the Paul to sail by the Ephesus, so that not it might be for him to spend time in the Asia; he was hastening for, if possible it was for him, the day of the pentecost to be in Jerusalem.

17. From and the Miletus having sent to Ephesus he called for the elders of the congregation.

18. When and they were come to him, he said to them: You know, from first day in which I entered into the Asia, how with you the whole time I was,

19. serving the Lord with all lowliness and tears and temptations, of those having happened to me by the plots of the Jews;

20. how nothing I kept back of that being profitable, the not to declare to you and to teach you publicly and in houses;

21. earnestly testifying to Jews both and Greeks the towards the God reformation, and faith that towards the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.

22. And now lo, having been bound I in the spirit, to go to Jerusalem, the things in her shall be happening to me not knowing,

23. except that the spirit the holy every city witnesses to me, saying, that bonds me and afflictions await.

24. But of no account I make, nor I the life of me valuable to myself, so that to finish the course of me with joy, and the services which I received from the Lord Jesus, to earnestly declare the glad tidings of the favor of the God.

25. And now lo, I know, that no longer will see the face of me you all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom of the God.

26. Therefore I testify to you in this day, that clean I from the blood of all;

27. not for I kept back of the not to declare to you all the will of the God.

28. Take heed therefore to yourselves and to all the flock, in which you the spirit the holy placed overseers, to feed the congregation of the Lord, which he purchased through the blood of the own.

29. I for know this, that shall enter after the departure of me wolves rapacious among you, not sparing the flock,

30. and from yourselves will arise men speaking perverse things, the to draw away the disciples after them.

31. Therefore watch you, remembering, that three years night and day not I ceased with tears admonishing one each.

32. And now I commend you, brethren, to the God and to the word of the favor of him, to that being able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among those having been sanctified all.

33. Silver or gold or raiment of no one I coveted;

34. yourselves you know; that the necessities of me and those being with me supplied the hands these.

35. All these I pointed out to you, that so laboring it is necessary to aid those being weak, to remember and the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said: Blessed it is more to give than to receive.

36. And these things having said, having placed the knees of himself, with all those he prayed.

37. Much and was weeping of all; and having fallen on the neck of the Paul, they affectionately kissed him;

38. sorrowing most of all for the word which he spoke, that no more, they are about the face of him to see. They accompanied and him to the ship.

## Acts 21

1. When and it happened to have sailed us having separated from them, having run a straight course we came to the Coos, the and next to the Rhodes, and thence to Patara.

2. And having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, going on board we set sail.

3. Having come in view and the Cyprus, and having left behind her on the left, we sailed into Syria, and were brought to Tyre; there for was the ship unloading the freight.

4. And having found the disciples, we remained there days seven; these to the Paul said through the spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.

5. When and it happened us to have completed the days, having gone out we went our way, accompanying us all with wives and children, till outside of the city; and having placed the knees on the shore, we prayed.

6. And having embraced each other, entered into the ship; they and returned into the own.

7. We and the voyage having finished, from Tyre we came down to Ptolemais; and having embraced the brethren, we remained day one with them.

8. On the and morrow having gone out we came into Caesarea; and having entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, being from of the seven, we remained with him.

9. To this and were daughters virgins four being gifted with prophecy.

10. Continuing and of us days many, came down a certain from the Judea a prophet by name Agabus;

11. and having come to us, and having taken the girdle of the Paul, having bound and of himself the hands and the feet, said: Thus says the spirit the holy: The man, of whom is the girdle this, so shall bind in Jerusalem the Jews, and deliver into hands of Gentiles.

12. When and they heard these things, entreated we both and those of the place, of the not to go up him to Jerusalem.

13. Answered and the Paul: What do you, weeping and breaking of me the heart? I for not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem in readiness I in behalf of the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. Not being persuaded and of him, we were silent, saying: The will of the Lord let it be done.

15. After and the days these packing up baggage we went up to Jerusalem.

16. Went with and also of the disciples from Caesarea with us, leading with whom we might lodge, to Mnason one Cyprian, an old disciple.

17. Having arrived and of us to Jerusalem, gladly received us the brethren.

18. On the and next had entered the Paul with us to James all and were present the elders.

19. And having saluted them, he related one by one, which did the God among the Gentiles through the service of him.

20. They and having heard glorified the God; they said and to him: Thou seest, O brother, how many myriads are of Jews of those having believed; and all zealots of the law being.

21. They were informed and concerning thee, that apostacy thou teachest from Moses those among the Gentiles all Jews, saying, not to circumcise them the children, nor the customs to walk.

22. What then it is? certainly must multitude to assemble; they will hear for that thou hast come.

23. This therefore do thou, what to thee we say: Are to us men four a vow having upon themselves.

24. These having taken, be thou purified with them, and be at expense for them, that they may shave the head, and will know all, that the things they have been informed concerning thee nothing is, but walkest orderly also himself the law keeping.

25. Concerning but those having believed of Gentiles we sent word, judging nothing such like to observe them, if not to keep themselves the, both things offered to idols and the blood and strangled and fornication.

26. Then the Paul having taken the men, on the following day with them being purified entered into the temple, announcing the completion of the days of the purification, till of which they offered in behalf of one of each of them the offering.

27. When and were about the seven days to be completed, those from the Asia Jews having seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd, and put on him the hands,

28. crying: Men Israelites, help you; this is the man, who against the people and the law and the place this all everywhere is teaching; besides and also Greeks be led into the temple, and has made common the holy place this.

29. (Were for having been before Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that into the temple led the Paul.)

30. Was moved and the city whole, and was a running together of the people; and having taken hold of the Paul, they were dragging him outside of the temple, and immediately were closed the gates.

31. Seeking and him to kill, went up a report to the commander of the band, that whole was in confusion Jerusalem;

32. who immediately having taken soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them. They and seeing the commander and the soldiers, ceased beating the Paul.

33. Then having approached the commander laid hold of him, and ordered to be bound with chains two; and inquired, who it might be, and what it is having been done.

34. Others and another thing were crying in the crowd. Not being able and to know the certainly through the tumult, he ordered to be brought him into the castle.

35. When and he came on the steps, it happened to be carried him by the soldiers through the violence of the crowd;

36. followed for the multitude of the people, crying: Lift up him.

37. Bring about and to be led into the castle the Paul, he says to the commander: If it is permitted for me to say anything to thee? He and said: Greek understandest thou?

38. Not then thou art the Egyptian, who before these the days having raised an insurrection and having led out into the desert the four thousand men of the Sicarii? Said and the Paul:

39. I a man indeed am a Jew of Tarsus, of the Cilicia not a mean city a citizen; I beseech and of thee, permit me to speak to the people.

40. Having permitted and him, the Paul having been set on the steps waved with the hand to the people; great and silence occurring, he spoke in the Hebrew dialect, saying:

## Acts 22

1. Men brethren and fathers, hear you of me the to you now apology.

2. Hearing and that in the Hebrew dialect he was speaking to them, more they kept silence. And he said:

3. I indeed am a man a Jew, having been born in Tarsus of the Cilicia, having been brought up and in the city this, at the feet of Gamaliel having been taught with accuracy the ancestral law, a zealot being of the God, even as all you are today;

4. who this the way I persecuted till death, binding and delivering into prisons men both and women,

5. as also the highpriest testifies to me, and all the eldership; from whom also letters having received to the brethren, to Damascus I went, going to lead and those there being; having been bound into Jerusalem, that they might be punished.

6. It happened and to me traveling and drawing near to the Damascus, about noon suddenly out of the heaven to shine round a light great about me;

7. fell and on the ground, and heard a voice saying to me: Saul, Saul, why me persecutest thou?

8. I and answered: Who art thou, O sir? He said and to me: I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou persecutest.

9. Those and with me being the indeed light saw, and terrified they were, the but voice not they heard of the speaking to me.

10. I said and : What shall I do, O Lord? The and Lord said to me: Having arisen go thou into Damascus; and there to thee it shall be told concerning all things, which have been appointed for thee to do.

11. As and not I saw from the glory of the light of that, being led by the hand by those being with me, I came into Damascus.

12. Ananias and one, a man pious according to the law, being testified to by all the residing Jews,

13. having come to me and having stood said to me: Saul O brother, look up. And I in this the hour looked on him.

14. He and said: The God of the fathers of us destined thee to know the will of himself, and to see the righteous one, and to hear a voice out of the mouth of him;

15. because thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and thou hast heard.

16. And now why dost thou delay? having arisen be thou dipped, and wash thyself from the sins of thee, having invoked the name of him.

17. It happened and to me having returned to Jerusalem, and praying of me in the temple, to have been me in an ecstacy,

18. and to see him saying to me: Do thou hasten, and come out with speed from Jerusalem; because not they will receive of thee the testimony concerning me.

19. And I said: O Lord, they know, that I was imprisoning and beating in the synagogues those believing on thee;

20. and when was poured out the blood of Stephen the martyr of thee, and myself was having been standing, and approving, and keeping the mantles of those killing him.

21. And he said to me: Go thou; for I to nations at distance will send thee.

22. They heard and him till this the word, and they raised the voice of them, saying: Lift up from the earth the such a person; not for it is fit him to live.

23. Crying out and of them and tossing up the mantles, and dust throwing into the air,

24. ordered the commander to lead him into the castle, saying with scourges to examine him; that he might know, on account of what cause thus they were crying against him.

25. As and they stretched out him with the thongs, said to the standing by centurion the Paul: If a man a Roman and uncondemned it is lawful for you to scourge?

26. Having heard and the centurion, having gone to the commander reported, saying: what are thou about to do? the for man this a Roman is.

27. Having come to and the commander said to him: Tell me, thou a Roman art? He and said: Yes.

28. Answered and the commander: I of a great sum of money the citizenship this purchased. The and Paul said: I but even have been born.

29. Immediately then went away from him those being about him to examine. And the commander also was afraid, having ascertained that a Roman he is, and that he was him having been bound.

30. On the and morrow wishing to know the certainty, that was he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him, and ordered to come together the highpriests and all the sanhedrim; and having led down the Paul, he stood among them.

## Acts 23

1. Having looked intently and the Paul to the sanhedrim, said: Men brethren, I in all conscience good have been as a citizen to the God till this the day.

2. The and highpriest Ananias gave a charge to those having been standing by him, to strike of him the mouth.

3. Then the Paul to him said: To strike thee is about the God, O wall having been white washed; and thou sittest judging me according to the law, and violating the law thou orderest me to be struck?

4. Those and having been standing by said: The highpriest of the God revilest thou?

5. Said and the Paul: Not I had known, brethren, that it is a highpriest; it is written for: A ruler of the people of thee not thou shalt speak evil.

6. Knowing and the Paul, that the one part is of Sadducees, the and other of Pharisees, he cried out in the sanhedrim: Men brethren, I a Pharisee am, a son of a Pharisee; concerning hope and a resurrection of dead ones I being judged.

7. This and of him having spoken, was a disciple of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and was divided the multitude.

8. Sadducees indeed for say not to be a resurrection, nor a messenger, nor a spirit; Pharisees but confess the both.

9. Was and an outcry great; and having arisen the scribes of the party of the Pharisees contended, saying: Nothing evil we find in the man this; if but a spirit spoke to him, or a messenger.

10. Great and becoming dispute, fearing the commander lest would be torn to pieces the Paul by them, he ordered the armed force having gone down to take him from midst of them, to lead and into the castle.

11. On the and next night having stood by him the Lord said: Take courage; as for thou didst testify the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so thee it behooves also in Rome to testify.

12. Becoming and day, having formed a conspiracy the Jews, they bound with a curse themselves, saying neither to eat nor drink till they might kill the Paul;

13. were and more forty those this the conspiracy having been engaged;

14. who having come to the highpriests and the elders, said: With a curse we have cursed ourselves, of nothing to taste till we have killed the Paul.

15. Now therefore you make known to the commander with the sanhedrim, in order that him he may lead down to you, as being about to examine more accurately the things concerning him; we and, before of the to have come nigh him, ready we are of the to kill him.

16. Having heard but the son of the sister of Paul the lying in wait, having come near and having gone into the castle, he related to the Paul.

17. Having summoned and the Paul one of the centurions, he said: The young man this lead thou to the commander; he has for something to relate to him.

18. Indeed then having taken him led to the commander, and said: The prisoner Paul having summoned me, asked this the young man to lead to thee, having something to say to thee.

19. Having taken and the hand of him the commander, and having related by himself, he inquired: What is it which thou hast to relate to me?

20. he said and: That the Jews agreed together of the to ask thee, that tomorrow into the sanhedrim thou mayest lead down the Paul, as being about something more accurately to investigate concerning him.

21. Thou therefore not shouldst be persuaded by the; lie in wait for him of them men more forty, who bound with a curse themselves, neither to eat nor to drink till they killed him; and now ready they are looking for the from thee promise.

22. The indeed then commander dismissed the young man, having charged to no one to speak out, that these things thou didst report to me.

23. And having summoned two certain of the centurions, he said: Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go to to Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, from third hour of the night;

24. animals and to have provided that having mounted the Paul they might convey safely to Felix the governor;

25. having written a letter containing the form this:

26. Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix health.

27. The man this having been seized by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, having come suddenly with the armed force I rescued him, having learned that a Roman he is.

28. Wishing and to know the cause on account of which they were accusing him, I led down him into the sanhedrim of them;

29. whom I found being accused concerning questions of the law of them, nothing but worthy of death or bonds an accusation having.

30. Having been disclosed but to me a plot against the man to be about to be by the Jews, instantly I sent to thee, having commanded also the accusers to say the things against him before thee. Farewell.

31. The indeed therefore soldiers, according to that having been commanded them, having taken the Paul, they led through the night into the Antipatris.

32. On the and morrow having left the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the castle.

33. Who having come into the Caesarea, and having delivered the letter to the governor, presented and the Paul to him.

34. Having read and, and having asked from what province he is, and having understood that from Cilicia;

35. I will fully hear thee, he said, when also the accusers of thee may arrive. He commanded and him in the judgmenthall of the Herod to be kept.

## Acts 24

1. After and five days went down the highpriest Ananias with the elders and an orator Tertullus certain, who appeared before the governor against the Paul.

2. Having been called and of him, began to accuse the Tertullus, saying:

3. Great peace enjoying through thee, and worthy deed being done to the nation this through of the of thy foresight, in every thing and everywhere we accept, O most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.

4. That and not to longer thee I may detain, I beseech to hear thee of us briefly in the thy elemency.

5. We have found for the man this a pestilence, and exciting a sedition in all the Jews those in the habitable, a leader and of the of the Nazarene sect,

6. who also the temple attempted to profane; whom also we apprehended, and according to the our law we wished to judge.

7. Having come but Lysias the commander, with a great force out of the hands of us led away,

8. having commanded the accusers of him to come to thee. from whom thou wilt be able thyself, having examined closely, concerning all of these things to have knowledge, of which we accuse him.

9. United in impeaching and also the Jews, asserting these things thus to be.

10. Answered and the Paul, nodding to him the governor to speak: From many years being thee a judge to the nation this knowing, more cheerfully the things concerning myself I defend;

11. being able of thee to know, that not more are to me days twelve, from which I went up to worship in Jerusalem.

12. And neither in the temple they found me with any one disputing, or a tumult making of a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;

13. nor to prove are they able, concerning which now they accuse me.

14. I confess but this to thee, that according to the way, which they called a sect, so I serve the patriarchal God, believing all things those according to the law and those in the prophets having been written:

15. A hope having in the God, which even they themselves are looking for, a resurrection about to be of dead ones, of just ones and also unjust ones.

16. In this and myself I exercise, a clear conscience to have towards the God and the men always.

17. In the course of years and many I came alms bringing to the nation of me, and offerings.

18. In which they found me having been purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor with a tumult. Some and from the Asia Jews,

19. who ought before thee to be present, and to accuse if anything they may have against me.

20. Or these themselves let them say, what they found in me crime, having stood of me before the sanhedrim;

21. or concerning one this voice, which cried out standing among them: That concerning a resurrection of dead ones I am judged today by you.

22. Put off but them the Felix, more accurately knowing the things concerning the way, saying: When Lysias the commander may come down, I will inquire into the things about you.

23. Having given orders and to the centurion to keep him, to have and liberty, and no one to forbid of the own friends of him to assist, for to come to him.

24. After and days some having come the Felix with Drusilia the wife, being a Jewess, he sent for the Paul, and heard him concerning the into Anointed faith.

25. Discoursing and of him concerning justice and selfcontrol and of the judgment that being about to come, terrified being the Felix answered: The present being go thou; a season and having found I will call thee.

26. At the same time also hoping, that money will be given to him by the Paul, so that he might loose him; therefore and oftener him sending for talked with him.

27. Two years but being ended received a successor the Felix Porcius Festus; wishing and favors to lay in store for himself with the Jews the Felix, left the Paul having been bond.

## Acts 25

1. Festus therefore having entered upon the prefecture, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.

2. Appeared before and him the highpriest and the chiefs of the Jews against the Paul, and entreated him,

3. asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; an ambush forming to kill him in the way.

4. The indeed then Festus answered, to be kept the Paul in Caesarea, himself but to be about with speed to go out.

5. Those therefore among you, he says, being able, having gone down with, if anything is in the man, let them accuse him.

6. Having remained and among them days not more eight or ten, having gone down into Caesarea, on the morrow having sat down on the judgmentseat, he commanded the Paul to be led forth.

7. Having approached and of him, stood around the from Jerusalem having been come down Jews, many and heavy accusations bring against the Paul, which not they were able to point out;

8. saying in defence of him: That neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar any thing did I wrong.

9. The Fetus but, with the Jews wishing a favor to lay for himself, answering to the Paul said: Art thou willing to Jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?

10. Said and the Paul: At the judgmentseat of Caesar standing I am, where me it behooves to be judged. Jews nothing I have done wrong, as also thou full well hast ascertained.

11. If indeed for I am unjust, and worthy of death I have done any thing, not I refuse the to die; if but nothing is of which these accuse me, no one me is able to them to give as a favor. Caesar I call upon.

12. Then the Festus having conferred with the council, answered: Caesar thou hast called upon; to Caesar thou shalt go.

13. Days and having intervened some, Agrippa the king and Bernice came down to Caesarea, paying their respects to the Festus.

14. When and many days they remained there, the Festus to the king submitted the things against the Paul, saying: A man certain is having been left behind by Felix a prisoner;

15. concerning whom, being of me in Jerusalem, gave information the highpriests and the elders of the Jews, asking against him a judgment.

16. To whom I answered, that not it is a custom for Romans to give as a favor any man, before he being accused face to face may have the accusers, an opportunity and of defence he may take concerning the accusation.

17. Having come therefore of them here, delay none having made, on the next day having sat down on the judgmentseat, I commanded to be brought the man.

18. Concerning whom having stood up the accusers no one accusation brought, of things supposed I;

19. questions but certain concerning of the own religion they had with him, and concerning one Jesus having been dead, whom affirmed the Paul to believe.

20. Being in doubt but I on that concerning this question, I said, if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things.

21. The but Paul having appealed to be kept himself for the of the Augustus decision, I commanded to be kept him, till I could send him to Caesar.

22. Agrippa but to the Festus said: I was wishing also myself the man to hear. The and morrow, he said, thou shalt hear him.

23. On the therefore morrow having come the Agrippa and the Bernice with great display, and having entered into the place of hearing, with both the commanders and men those principal being of the city, and having commanded the Festus, was brought the Paul.

24. And said the Festus: Agrippa O king, and all those things being present with us men, you see this, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews applied to me in both Jerusalem and here, crying out not to be right to live him longer.

25. I but having detected nothing worthy of death him to have done, also of him and of this having appealed to the Augustus, I resolved to send him.

26. Concerning whom certain any thing to write to the lord, not I have, therefore I led forth him before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, so that the examination having taken place I may have something to write.

27. Absurd for to me it seems sending a prisoner, not and the against him charges to signify.

## Acts 26

1. Agrippa and to the Paul said: It is permitted for thee in behalf of thyself to speak. Then the Paul made a defence, having stretched out the hand;

2. concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, O king Agrippa, I esteem myself happy, before thee being about today to make a defence;

3. especially acquainted being thee of all of the among Jews customs and also questions. Therefore I entreat thee, patiently to hear of me.

4. The indeed therefore mode of life of me that from youth, that from beginning being among the nation of me in Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

5. previously knowing me from the first, (if they would be willing to testify,) that according to the most rigid sect of the our religion I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now for hope of that to the fathers promise being made by the God, I have stood being judged;

7. to which the twelve tribes of us, in intently night and day serving, hopes to attain; concerning which hope I am accused, O king Agrippa, by Jews.

8. What? incredible is it judged by you, if the God dead ones raises?

9. I indeed therefore thought in myself to the name of Jesus the Nazarene ought many things against to practice.

10. Which also I did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints I in prisons shut up, the from of the highpriests authority having received; being killed and of them, I brought against a vote;

11. and in all the synagogues often publishing them, I was compelling to blaspheme; exceedingly and being furious towards them, I purchased till even into the foreign cities.

12. In which also going to the Damascus with authority and a commission of that from the highpriests,

13. of a day middle, in the way I saw, O king, from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, having shone round me a light and those with me going.

14. All and having fallen down of us on the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect: Saul, Saul, why me persecutest thou? hard for thee against sharp points to kick.

15. I and said: Who art thou, O sir? He and said: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.

16. But arise thou, and stand up on the feet of thee; for this for I appeared to thee, to constitute thee a minister and a witness, of what both thou didst see, of what and I will appear to thee;

17. delivering thee from the people and the Gentiles, to whom I thee send,

18. to open eyes of them, of the to have turned from darkness to light, and of the authority of the adversary to the God, of the to receive them forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among those having been sanctified, faith by the into me.

19. There upon, O king Agrippa, not I was disobedient to the heavenly vision;

20. but to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem, in all and the country of the Judea, and to the Gentiles, I declared to reform, and to turn to the God, worthy of the reformation works doing.

21. On account of these me the Jews having seized in the temple attempted with violent hands to have killed.

22. Help therefore having obtained of that from of the God, till the day this I have stood, testifying to small both and to great, nothing beyond saying, of what both the prophets spoke being about to take place, and Moses;

23. that liable to suffer the Anointed, that first from a resurrection of dead ones a light he is about to announce to the people and to the Gentiles.

24. These things and of him saying in defence the Festus loud with the voice said: Thou art mad, O Paul; the much learning into madness turns about.

25. He but: I am mad; he says: O most noble Festus, but of truth and of sanity word to utter.

26. Is acquainted for concerning these things the king, to whom also being confident I may speak; unobserved by for him any of these things not I am persuaded nothing; not for it is in a corner having been done this.

27. Believest thou, O king Agrippa, in the prophets? I know, that thou believest.

28. The and Agrippa to the Paul said: Within a little me thou persuadest a Christian to become.

29. The and Paul said: I would pray to the God, and within a little and within much not only thee, but also all those hearing me today, to become such as even I am, except the chains these.

30. Arose and the king and the governor, the and Bernice, and those being seated with them;

31. and having retired they spoke to each other, saying: That nothing of death worthy or of bonds does the man this.

32. Agrippa and to the Festus said: To have been released might the man this, if not he had called on Caesar.

## Acts 27

1. When and it was determined of the to sail us to the Italy, they delivered the both Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion, by name Julius, of a cohort of Augustus.

2. Having gone on board and a ship Adramyttium, being about to sail the in the Asia places, we were put to sea, being with up Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica.

3. On the and next day we were brought to Sidon; humanely and the Julius to the Paul having treated, permitted to the friends having gone care to have obtained.

4. And from thence having put to sea we sailed under the Cyprus, because the the winds to be contrary.

5. The, and deep that by the Cilicia and Pamphylia having sailed through, we came down to Myra of the Lycia.

6. And there having found the centurion a ship Alexandrian sailing for the Italy, put us into it.

7. In many and days sailing slowly, and scarcely being by the Cnidus, not permitting an approach us of the wind, we sailed under the Crete by Salome;

8. with difficulty and sailing by her, we came to a place certain being called Fair havens, to which near was a city Lasea.

9. A long and time having elapsed, and being already hazardous of the sailing, because the even the fast already to have been past, advised the Paul,

10. saying to them: Men, I perceive, that with damage and much loss not only of the freight and of the ship, but also of the lives of us to be about to be the voyage.

11. The but centurion by the pilot and by the owner of the ship was persuaded rather, than by those by the Paul being spoken.

12. Inconvenient and of the harbor being to winter in, the greater part placed a wish to be led out from thence also, if possibly they might be able having come to Phenice to winter, a harbor of the Crete looking towards southwest and towards northwest.

13. Having blown gently and South wind, supposing the purpose to have been attained, having raised up, close passed by the Crete.

14. After not much but beat against her a wind tempestuous, that being called Euroclydon.

15. Having been caught and the ship, and not being able to bear up against the wind, having given up we were driven.

16. A small island and certain having run under being called Clauda, scarcely we were able masters to become of the boat;

17. which having taken up, helps they used, undergirding the ship; fearing and lest into the quicksand they should fall, having lowered the mast, thus were driven.

18. Exceedingly and being stormtossed of us, on the next a throwing out they began;

19. and on the third with their own hands the furniture of the ship they threw out.

20. Neither and sun, nor stars appearing for many days, a tempest and not small pressing, remaining was taken away all hope of the to be saved us.

21. Long but abstinence existing, than standing the Paul in midst of them, said: It was proper indeed, O men, having taken advice to me not to have loosed from the Crete, to have gained and the damage this and the loss.

22. And now I exhort you to take courage; loss for of a life not one shall be from of you, except the ship.

23. Stood by for me this the night a messenger of the God, of whom I am to whom also I offer service,

24. saying: Not fear, O Paul: To Caesar thee it behooves to be presented; and lo, has graciously given to thee the God all those sailing with thee.

25. Therefore take you courage, men; I believe for in the God that thus it shall be in which manner it has been told to me.

26. On an island but certain it is necessary us to be cast.

27. When and fourteenth night was come, being driven along of us in the Adriatic, about middle of thew night suspected the sailors to draw near some to them country;

28. and having heaved the lead, they found fathoms twenty; a little and having intervened, and again having the lead, they found fathoms fifteen;

29. fearing and, lest on rough places we should fall, out of stern having thrown anchors four, they were wishing day to be.

30. The and sailors seeking to flee out of the ship and having lowered the boat into the sea, for an excuse as out of prow being about anchors to let down,

31. said the Paul to the centurion and to the soldiers: If not these remain in the ship, you to be saved not are able.

32. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and allowed her to fall.

33. Till and while about day to be, called upon the Paul all to partake of food, saying: Fourteenth today day looking for, without food you continue, nothing having taken.

34. Therefore I entreat you to partake of food; this for to the your salvation is; of not one for of you a hair from of the head will perish.

35. Having said and these, and having taken bread, he gave thanks to the God in presence of all, and having broken began to eat.

36. Encouraged and becoming all, also they received food.

37. We were and in the ship the all souls, two hundred seventy six.

38. Being satisfied and of food, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat into the sea.

39. When and day it was, the land not they knew; a bay but they perceived having a shore, into which they wished, if they were able, to force the ship.

40. And the anchors having cut off left in the sea, at the same time having loosed the bands of the rudders; and having hoisted the foresail to the wind, they pressed towards the shore.

41. Having fallen and into a place with a sea on both sides, they ran a ground the vessel; and the indeed prow having stuck fast remained immovable, the but stern was broken by the violence of the waves.

42. The and soldiers design was, that the prisoners they should kill, lest any one having swum out should escape.

43. The but centurion wishing to save the Paul, restrained them from the purpose, ordered and those being able to swim, having thrown off first to the land to go out;

44. and the remaining ones, some indeed on boards, some and on things of the from of the ship. And thus it happened all to be safely on the land.

## Acts 28

1. And having safely escaped, then they knew that Melita the island is called.

2. The and barbarians rendered not the ordinary kindness to us; having kindled for a fire; they brought to all of us, because of the rain that having been present, and because of the cold.

3. Having gathered and the Paul of sticks a bundle, and having placed on the fire, a viper from the heat having come out fastened on the hand of him.

4. When and saw the barbarians hanging the wild beast from the hand of him, they said to each other: Certainly a murderer is the man this, whom having been saved from the sea the Justice to live not permitted.

5. He indeed then having shaken off the wild beast into the fire, suffered nothing bad;

6. they but were expecting him to be about to swell, or to fall down suddenly dead. For a long and of them, expecting, and seeing nothing out of place to him happening, changing their minds they said: A god him to be.

7. In and to those about the place that were farms to the chiefs of the island, by name Poplius; who having received us, three days kindly entertained.

8. It happened and the father of the Poplius with fevers and dysentery being seized was lying down; to whom the Paul going in, and having prayed, having placed the hands to him, healed him.

9. This therefore being done, and the others those having sicknesses in the island, came, and were healed;

10. who also with many rewards rewarded us, and leading out they placed on the things for the need.

11. After and three months we sailed in a ship having been wintered in the island, Alexandrian, with an ensign Dioscuri.

12. And having been led own to Syracuse, we remained days three.

13. Whence having gone round we came to Rhegium; and after one day having sprung up a South wind, second day we came to Puteoli;

14. where having found brethren we were invited by them to remain days seven; and thus towards the Rome we went.

15. And thence the brethren having heard the things concerning us, came out to a meeting with us as far as Appii forum, and Three taverns; whom seeing the Paul, having given thanks to the God, he took courage.

16. When and we came to Rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the perfect of the Pretorium camp; the but Paul was permitted to abide by himself, with the watching him soldiers.

17. It happened and after days three to have called together to him those being of the Jews chiefs. Having come together and of them, he said to them: Men brethren, I nothing against having done to the people or to the customs those paternal, a prisoner from Jerusalem I was delivered into the hands of the Romans;

18. who having examined me wished to release, because that no one cause of death to be in me.

19. Speaking against and the Jews, I was forced to call upon Caesar; not as of the nation of me having anything to accuse.

20. Because of this therefore the cause I called you to see and to speak with; on account for of the hope of the Israel the chain this I wear around.

21. They and to him said: We neither letters concerning thee received from the Judea, neither having come any one of the brethren related or spoken anything concerning thee evil.

22. we deem proper but from thee to hear, what thou thinkest; concerning indeed for of the sect this known is to us, that everywhere it is spoken against.

23. Having appointed and to him a day, came to him to the lodging many; to whom he set forth testifying earnestly the kingdom of the God, persuading and them the things concerning the Jesus, from both the law of Moses and of the prophets, from morning till evening.

24. And these indeed were persuaded by the words being spoken, those but believed not.

25. Not agreed and being with each other, they were dismissed, saying of the Paul word one: That well the spirit the holy spoke through Esaias the prophet to the fathers of us,

26. saying: Go thou to the people this, and say thou: With ears you will hear, and not not you may understand; and seeing you will see, and not not you may perceive.

27. Unfeeling for the heart of the people this and with the ears heavily they hear, and the eyes of them they closed; lest at any time they should see the eyes, and with the ears they should hear, and with the heart they should understand, and should return, and I should heal them.

28. Known therefore let it be to you, that to the Gentiles is sent the salvation of the God; they and will hear.

29. And these things of him saying, went the Jews, much having among themselves discussion.

30. He abode and two years whole in the hired dwelling; and received all those coming in to him, publishing the kingdom of the God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Anointed with all freedom of speech, unrestrained.
