# 2 Peter

## 2 Peter 1

1. Simon Peter, a bondman and and an apostle of Jesus Anointed, to those equally precious to us having obtained faith by righteousness of the God of us and a savior Jesus Anointed;

2. favor to you and peace may be multiplied by a knowledge of the God, and of Jesus the Lord of us.

3. As all to us of the divine power of him the things in respect to life and piety having been granted, through the knowledge of the one having called us by means of glory and virtue;

4. (through which the greatest to us and precious promises have been given, so that through these you might become of a divine partakers nature having fled away from the in world, by inordinate desire corruption;)

5. also very this thing and diligence all having brought in beside; do you superadd to the faith of you the fortitude, to and the fortitude the knowledge,

6. to and the knowledge the selfcontrol, to and the selfcontrol the patience, to and the patience the piety,

7. to and the piety the brotherlykindness, to and the brotherkindness the love.

8. These things for to you belonging and abounding, not idle ones nor unfruitful ones they make you in the of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed knowledge;

9. to whom for not is present these things, blind is, being shortsighted, a forgetfulness having received of the purification of the old of himself sins.

10. Therefore rather, brethren, do you earnestly strive sure of you the calling and election to make; these things for doing not not you may fail at any time.

11. So for richly will be furnished to you the entrance into the agelasting kingdom of the Lord of us and Savior Jesus Anointed.

12. Therefore not I will neglect always you to remind concerning these things, although knowing, and being established in the present truth.

13. Right and I think, in as much as I am in this the tabernacle, to stir up you by a reminding;

14. knowing, that near at hand it is the laying aside of the tabernacle of me, as even the Lord of us Jesus Anointed declared to me.

15. I will endeavor but also always, to have you after the my departure, the of these things a recollection to make.

16. Not for having been cunningly devised tales having followed out we made known to you the of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed power and presence, but lookers on having become of the of that greatness.

17. Having received for from God a Father honor and glory, from a voice having been brought to him of this kind by the magnificent glory: This is the son of me the beloved, in whom I am delighted.

18. And this the voice we heard from heaven having been brought with him being in the mountain the holy,

19. and we have more firm the prophetic word; to which well you do taking heed, as to a lamp shining in a filthy place, till of which a day may shine through, and bring light may arise in the hearts of you;

20. this first knowing, that all prophecy of a writing, of its own loosing not it is.

21. Not for by will of man was brought at any time prophecy, but by spirit holy being moved spoke holy of God men.

## 2 Peter 2

1. Were but even false prophets among the people, as also among you will be false teachers, who will privately introduce heresies of destruction, even the having bought them sovereign Lord denying, bring on themselves swift destruction;

2. (and many will follow of them the impure practice, on account of whom the way of the truth will be evil spoken of;)

3. and by covetousness deceitful words you they will make gain of; to whom the judgment of old not lingers, and the destruction of them not slumbers.

4. If for the God messengers having sinned not spared, but with chains of think darkness having confined Tartarus he delivered up for a judgment being kept;

5. and of old a world not he spared, but eighth Noah of righteousness a herald he kept safe a deluge to a world of impious one having brought;

6. and cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having reduced to ashes to an overthrow he condemned, an example future to be impious having been placed;

7. and just Lot being wearied by the of the lawless ones in lewdness of behavior he rescued;

8. (in seeing for and in hearing the just one, dwelling among them, day by days soul righteousness with lawless deeds was tormented;)

9. knows Lord pious ones out of temptation to rescue, unjust ones but for a day of judgment being cut off to be kept;

10. especially but those after flesh in lust of pollution going, and lordship despising. Daring, selfwilled, of dignities not they are afraid speaking evil;

11. where messengers in strength and power greater being, not bring against them from Lord a railing judgment;

12. these but, like irrational animals, natural, having been made for capture and slaughter, in which things they do not understand reviling, in the corruption of them they will be destroyed,

13. receiving a reward of unrighteousness; a pleasure esteeming the in day luxury, spots and stains, revelling in the deceptions of themselves, feasting together with you,

14. eyes having full of an adulteress and unrestrained from sin, alluring souls unstable, a heart having been trained for covetousness having, of a curse children,

15. having left a straight way, they wandered, having followed in the way of the Balaam of the Bosor, who a reward of unrighteousness loved,

16. a reproof but he had of his own transgression; a beast of burden dumb, with of man a voice having spoken, restrained the of the prophet madness.

17. These are fountains without water, and fogs by a whirlwind being driven; for which the gloom of the darkness for an age has been kept.

18. Swellings for of folly speaking they allure by lusts of flesh, by impurities, those scarcely having fled away from those in error living;

19. freedom to them promising themselves slaves being of the corruption; by what for any one has been over come, by this also he has been enslaved.

20. If for having fled away from the pollution of the world by a knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Anointed, with these and again having been entangled they are overcome, has become to them the things last worse of the first.

21. Better for it was for them, not to have known the way of the righteousness, than having known to have turned back from the having been delivered to them holy commandment.

22. It has happened but to them the of the true proverb: A dog having turned back to the own vomit; and: A hog having been washed, to a rollingplace of mire.

## 2 Peter 3

1. This now, beloved ones, second to you I write a letter, in which I stir up of you by a remembrance the sincere mind;

2. to be mindful of the having been spoken before words by the holy prophets, and of the of the apostles of us commandment of the Lord and savior;

3. this first knowing, that will come in last of the days with scoffing scoffers, according to the own lusts of themselves walking,

4. and saying: Where is the promise of the presence of him? from of which for the fathers feel asleep, all things thus remains from a beginning of creation.

5. It escapes notice for them this being willing, that heavens were of old, and earth out of water and through water having been placed together, by the of the God word,

6. by means of which things the then world by water having been deluged was destroyed;

7. the but now heavens and the earth by the him word having been treasured up are, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men.

8. One but this not let escape you, beloved ones, that one day with Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as a day one.

9. Not is slow the Lord of the promise, as some slowness account; but is longsuffering towards us not desiring some to perish, but all for a reformation to come.

10. Will come but the day of Lord as a thief, in which the heavens with a rushing sound will pass away, elements and burning intensely will be dissolved, and earth and all in her works will be burned up.

11. Of these things therefore all being dissolved, what ones it behooves to be you in holy conduct and piety;

12. looking for and hastening the presence of the of the God day, on account of which heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and elements burning intensely melts.

13. New but heavens and earth new according to the promise of him we look for, in which righteousness dwells.

14. Therefore, beloved ones, these things looking for, do you diligently endeavor spotless and blameless by him to be found in peace,

15. and the of the Lord of us longsuffering, salvation do you reckon; as also the beloved of us brother Paul according to the to him having been given wisdom wrote to you,

16. as also in all the letters, speaking in them concerning these; in which is hardly understood some things, which those unlearned and unstable distort, as also the remaining writings, to the own of themselves destruction.

17. You therefore, beloved ones, knowing before, be you on guard, so that not by the of the lawless ones deceit having been led away, you may fall from the own stability;

18. grow you but in favor and knowledge of the Lord of us and Savior Jesus Anointed. To him the glory both now and to a day of an age; so be it.
