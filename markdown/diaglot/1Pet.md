# 1 Peter

## 1 Peter 1

1. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Anointed, to chosen ones sojourners of a dispersion of Pontus, of Galatia, of Cappadocia, of Asia and of Bithynia,

2. according to foreknowledge of God a Father, in sanctification of spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of blood of Jesus Anointed; favor to you and peace may be multiplied.

3. Blessed the God and Father of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, that according to the great of himself mercy having begotten us to a hope of life through a resurrection of Jesus Anointed, out of dead ones,

4. to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in heavens for you,

5. those by power of God being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in season last;

6. in which rejoice you, a little while now (if necessary it is) having been distressed by manifold trials,

7. so that the proof of you of the faith much more precious of gold of that perishing, by means of fire but being proved, may be found to praise and honor and glory, at a revelation of Jesus Anointed;

8. whom not seeing you love, on whom, now not looking, believing but, you rejoice with a joy unspeakable and having been glorified,

9. obtaining the end of the faith of you, a salvation of souls.

10. Concerning which salvation sought out and examined closely prophets, those concerning the for you favor having prophesied;

11. examining, to what things or what season did point the in them spirit of Anointed, testifying before the for Anointed sufferings, and the after these things glorious;

12. to whom it was revealed, that not for themselves, for you but they ministered these things, which things now were told to you through those having announced glad tidings you with spirit holy having been sent from heaven, into which things earnestly desire messengers to look attentively.

13. Therefore having girded up the loins of the minds of you, being vigilant, perfectly do you hope for the being brought to you gift in a revelation of Jesus Anointed;

14. as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves to the former in the ignorance of you lusts,

15. but according to the one having called you holy, and yourselves holy ones in all conduct become you;

16. because it has been written: Holy ones become you, because I holy am.

17. And if a Father you call on him without respect of persons judging according to the of each work, in fear the of the sojourning of you time pass you;

18. knowing, that not by corruptible things, by silver or by gold you were bought off from the foolish of you conduct handed down from your fathers,

19. but with precious blood, as of a lamb spotless and unblemished, of Anointed;

20. having been foreknown indeed before a laying down of a world, having been manifested but in last of the times on account of you,

21. those through him having believed in God, that one having raised up him out of dead ones and glory to him having given, so that the faith of you and hope to be in God.

22. The lives of you having been purified in the obedience of the truth through spirit to brotherly kindness unfeigned, out of a pure heart each other love you intensely;

23. having been begotten again not from seed corruptible, but incorruptible, through word living of God and remaining.

24. Because all flesh like grass, and all glory of her like a flower of grass; withered the grass and the flower of it fell off;

25. the but word of Lord abides to the age; this now is the word that having been announced to you.

## 1 Peter 2

1. Having put away therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evilspeakings,

2. as newborn babes, the rational sincere milk earnestly desire you, so that by it you may grow to salvation;

3. if indeed you tasted, that gracious the Lord.

4. To whom drawing near, a stone living, by men indeed being rejected, with but God chosen, honorable,

5. and yourselves as stones living be you built up, a house spiritual, a priesthood holy, to offer spiritual sacrifices, wellpleasing to the God through Jesus Anointed.

6. Because it is contained in the writing: Lo, I place in Zion a stone cornerfoundation, chosen, honorable; and the believing on it, not not may be ashamed.

7. To you therefore the honor to those believing to disbelieving but, a stone which rejected those building, this became for a head of a corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence;

8. those stumbling, to the word being disobedient, for which even they were appointed.

9. You but, a race chosen, a royal priesthood, a nation holy, a people for a purpose, so that the virtues you may declare of the out of darkness you one having called into the wonderful of himself light;

10. those once not a people, now but a people of God; those not having obtained mercy, now but having obtained mercy.

11. Beloved ones, I entreat as strangers and sojourners, to abstain from the fleshly lusts, which war against the life;

12. the conduct of you among the Gentiles having upright; so that in what they speak against you as evildoers, from the good works having looked on, they may glorify the God in a day of inspection.

13. Be you subject therefore to every human creation on account of the Lord; whether to a king, as being preeminent;

14. or to governors, as by means of him being sent for punishment of evildoers, praise but of gooddoers;

15. (because thus it is the will of the God, welldoing to muzzle the of the unwise of men ignorance;)

16. as freemen, and not as a covering having of the badness the freedom, but as slaves of God.

17. All do you honor; the brotherhood do you love; the God do you fear; the king do you honor.

18. The household servants, being submissive with all fear to the masters, not only to the good ones and gentle ones, but also to the perverse ones.

19. This for pleasing, if through a conscience of God bears up under any one griefs, suffering unjustly.

20. What for credit, if sinning and being beaten you shall endure? but if doing good and suffering you shall endure, this pleasing with God.

21. To this for you were called; because even Anointed suffered on behalf of you, to you leaving behind an example, so that you may follow in the steps of him;

22. who sin not did, nor was found guile in the mouth of him;

23. who being reviled not reviled again, suffering not he threatened, delivered himself up but to the one judging righteously;

24. who the sins of us himself carried up in the body of himself to the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; of whom by the scars of him you were healed.

25. You were for as sheep going astray; but have turned back now to the shepherd and guardian of the lives of you.

## 1 Peter 3

1. In like manner the wives, submitting yourselves to the own husbands, so that even if some are disobedient to the word, through the of the wives conduct without a word they may be gained,

2. having seen the in fear pure conduct of you.

3. Of whom let be not the outside, of braiding of hairs and placing around of golden chains or wearing of clothes, adorning;

4. but the hidden of the heart man, with the incorruptible of the meek and quiet spirit, which is in presence of the God very precious.

5. Thus for formerly also the holy women, those hoping in the God, adorned themselves, submitting to the own husbands;

6. as Sarah hearkened to the Abraham, lord, him calling, of her you became children, doing good and not fearing not one terror.

7. The husbands like manner, dwelling with according to knowledge as a weaker vessel with the female, bestowing honor as also being jointheirs of gracious gift of life, in order that not to be hindered the prayers of you.

8. The but end, all of like mind, sympathizing ones, lovers of brethren, compassionate ones, humbleminded ones,

9. not returning evil on account of evil, or reviling on account of of reviling; on the contrary but invoking blessings; knowing, that for this you were called, so that a blessing you may inherit.

10. The for one wishing life to love, and to see days good let him restrain the tongue of himself from evil, and lips of himself of the not to speak deceit;

11. let him turn away from evil, and let him do good; let him seek peace, and let him pursue her.

12. Because the eyes of Lord on just ones, and ears of him towards prayer of them; a face but of Lord against those doing evil.

13. And who the one will be injuring you if of the good imitators you become?

14. But if even you suffer because of righteousness, happy ones. The but fear of them not do you fear, neither should you troubled;

15. Lord but the God do you sanctify in the hearts of you; prepared and always with a defence to all to the one asking you an account concerning the in you hope, with meekness and fear;

16. a conscience having good, so that in what they may speak against you as of evildoers, they may be ashamed those slandering of you the good in Anointed conduct.

17. Better for doing good, if may will the will of the God, to suffer, or doing evil;

18. because even Anointed once concerning sins suffered, a just one on behalf of unjust ones, so that us he might lead to the God, being put to death indeed in flesh, being made alive but in spirit;

19. by which also to those in prison having gone he published,

20. having disobeyed once, when was waiting the of the God patience, in days of Noah, being prepared an ark, in which a few (this is eight) lives were carried safely through water;

21. which also us a representation now saves a dipping, (not of flesh a putting away of fifth, but a conscience good seeking after towards God,) through resurrection of Jesus Anointed;

22. who is at right of the God, having gone into heaven, having been subjected to him messengers and authorities and powers.

## 1 Peter 4

1. Anointed then having suffered on behalf of us in flesh, and you the same thought arm yourselves, (because the one having suffered in flesh, has ceased from sin,)

2. in order that no longer of men to desire, but to will of God the remaining in flesh to live time.

3. Sufficient for for us the having passed by time of the life the will of the Gentiles, to havewrought, having walked in licentiousness, in inordinate desires, in excesses of wine, in revellings, in drinkings, and in unlawful idolatries;

4. in which they are surprised, not running with of you to the same the of profligacy excess, speaking evil;

5. they shall give an account to him in readiness having to judge living ones and dead ones.

6. In order to this for also to dead ones was glad tidings announced, so that they might be judged indeed according to men in flesh they might live but according to God in spirit.

7. All things but the end has approached; be you of same mind therefore, and be you vigilant in the prayers.

8. Above all things but the among yourselves love fervent having; because the love will cover a multitude of sins;

9. hospitable towards each other, without murmurings;

10. each one as received a freegift, for others it serving, as good stewards of manifold favor of God.

11. If any one speaks, as oracles of God; if any one serves, as from strength which supplies the God; so that in all things may be glorified the God through Jesus Anointed, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of the ages; so be it.

12. Beloved ones, not be you surprised with the among you burning for a trial to you becoming, as of a strange thing to you befalling;

13. but according to you partake in the of the Anointed sufferings, rejoice you, so that also in the revelation of the glory of him you may rejoice exulting.

14. If you are reproached in name of Anointed, happy ones; because the of the glory and the of the God spirit on you rests; according to indeed them he is evil spoken of, according to but you he is glorified.

15. Not for any one of you let suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer, or as a meddling person;

16. if but as a Christian, not let him be ashamed let him glorify but the God in the respect to this.

17. Because the season for the to begin the judgment from the house of the God; if but first from of us, what the end of those being disobedient to the of the God glad tidings?

18. and if the just one scarcely is safe, the impious one and sinner where will appear?

19. therefore also those suffering according to the will of the God, as to a faithful creator let commit the lives of themselves in doing good.

## 1 Peter 5

1. Elders the among you I exhort, the fellowelder and witness of those of the Anointed sufferings, the and of the being about to be revealed glory partaker;

2. do you feed the among you flock of the God, overseeing not by constraint, but voluntarily; nor for base gain, but promptly;

3. nor as being lords of the heritages, but patterns being of the flock;

4. and having been manifested of the chief shepherd, you will obtain the unfading of the glory crown.

5. In like manner younger ones be you subject to seniors; all but to each other being subject, the humility be you clothed with; because the God to haughty ones is in opposition, to lowly ones but he gives favor.

6. Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of the God, so that you he may exalt in a season;

7. all the anxious care of you having cast on him, because with him is care concerning you.

8. Be you sober, be you watchful; the opponent of you an accuser, like a lion roaring, walks about seeking whom he may gulp down,

9. to whom be you opposed steadfast ones in the faith, knowing, the same kinds of the sufferings by the in world brotherhood to be fully endured.

10. The and God of all favor that one having called us into the agelasting of himself glory by Anointed Jesus, a little having suffered, himself to complete you, he will confirm, he will strengthen, he will establish.

11. To him the glory, and the power for the ages of the ages; so be it.

12. By means of Silvanus to you of the faithful a brother, as I think, in a few I have written, exhorting and strongly testifying this to be true favor of the God, in which you have stood.

13. Salute you she in Babylon chosen jointly, and Mark the son of me.

14. Salute you each other with a kiss of love. Peace to you to all those in Anointed Jesus.
