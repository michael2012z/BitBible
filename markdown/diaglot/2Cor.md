# 2 Corinthians

## 2 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Anointed through will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the congregation of the God to that being in Corinth, with the saints to all those being in whole the Achaia;

2. favor to you and peace from God a Father of you, and Lord Jesus Anointed.

3. Worthy of praise the God and Father of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, the Father of the mercies, and God of all comfort,

4. the one comforting us in all the affliction of us, in order that to be able us to comfort those in every affliction, by means of the comfort, of which we are comforted ourselves by the God;

5. because as abounds the sufferings of the Anointed in us, so by means of the Anointed abounds also the comfort of us.

6. Whether but we are afflicted, on behalf of the of you comfort, and salvation; whether we are comforted, on behalf of the of you comfort, of that operating patient endurance of the same sufferings, which also we suffer; (and the hope of us stedfast on behalf of you;)

7. knowing, that as partakers you are of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.

8. Not for we wish to be ignorant, brethren, concerning the affliction of us of that happening to us in the Asia, that according to excess we were pressed above strength, so that to be in despair us even of the life;

9. but ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death we have, so that not having trusted we should in ourselves, but in the God that one raising up the dead ones;

10. who from so great a death rescued us, and does rescue; in whom we have hoped, that even still he will rescue,

11. cooperating also you on behalf of us in the prayer, that from many faces the for us gift through many might be given thanks on behalf of us.

12. The for boasting of us this is, the testimony of the conscience of us, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, (not in wisdom fleshly, but in favor of God) we conducted in the world, more abundantly but to you.

13. Not for other things we write to you, but what you read, or what you acknowledge; I hope and, that even till end you will acknowledge,

14. as also you acknowledged us from parts; because a boasting of you we are, even as also you of us, in the day of the Lord Jesus.

15. And in this the confidence I wished to you to come before, so that a second favor you may have;

16. and through you to pass through into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be sent forward into the Juda.

17. This therefore wishing, not certainly in the lightness did I use? or the things I purpose, according to flesh do I purpose, that may be with me the yes yes, and the no no?

18. Faithful but the God, that the word of us that to you not was yes and no.

19. The for of the God son Jesus Anointed, that among you by means of us having been preached, (by means of me and Silvanus and Timothy,) not became yes and no, but yes in him has become,

20. (as many for promises of God, in him the yes, and in him the so be it,) to the God for glory on account of us.

21. The but one establishing us with you for Anointed, and having anointed us, God;

22. he and having sealed us, and having given the pledge of the spirit in the hearts of us.

23. I but a witness the God call upon to the my soul, that sparing you not yet I came to Corinth;

24. not because we lord it over you of the faith, but fellowworkers we are of the joy of you; in the for faith you have stood.

## 2 Corinthians 2

1. I decided but with myself this, that not again in grief to you to come.

2. If for I grieve you, indeed who is the one gladdening me, if not the one being grieved from me?

3. And I wrote to you this same thing, so that not having come grief I have from of whom it behooves me rejoice; having confided in all you, that the my joy of all of you it is.

4. Out of for much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you might be grieved, but the love that you might know, which I have more abundantly towards you.

5. If but any one has been grieved, not me he has grieved, but from parts, that not I may bear hard upon, all you.

6. Sufficient to the such one the censure this which by the majority;

7. so that on the other hand rather you to freely forgive and to comfort, lest by the more abundant grief should be swallowed the such one.

8. Wherefore I entreat you to publicly confirm to him love.

9. In order to this for also I wrote, so that I might know the proof of you, if to all things obedient you are.

10. To whom but anything you freely forgive, also I; even for I what have freely forgiven, if anything I have freely forgiven, on account of you, in presence of Anointed;

11. that not we should be overreached by the adversary; not for of him the devices we are ignorant.

12. Having come but to the Troas for the glad tidings of the Anointed, and a door to me having been opened by Lord, not I had rest in the spirit of me, by the not to come me Titus the brother of me;

13. but having bade farewell to them, I went out into Macedonia.

14. To the but God thanks to that always leading to triumph us in the Anointed, and the order of the knowledge of himself is manifesting through us in every place.

15. That of Anointed a sweet order we are to the God in those being saved and in those perishing;

16. to them indeed an order of death into death; to those but, an order of life into life. And for these things who sufficient?

17. Not for we are like the many, adulterating the word of the God; but as from sincerity, but as from God, in presence of the God, in Anointed we speak.

## 2 Corinthians 3

1. Do we begin again ourselves to commend? or not we need, as some, of recommendation letters to you or from you of recommendation?

2. The letter of us you are, having been written in the hearts of you, being known and being read by all men;

3. being manifest, that you are a letter of Anointed having been ministered by us, having been written not with ink, but by spirit of God living, not on tablets of stones, but on tablets of hearts fleshly.

4. Confidence but such we have through the Anointed towards the God;

5. not because sufficient we are from ourselves, to reason anything, as from ourselves, but the sufficiency of us from of the God;

6. who also qualified us servants of a new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit; the for letter kills, the but spirit gives life.

7. If but the service of the death in letters, having been engraved in stone, was made in glory, so that not to be able to look steadily the sons of Israel into the face of Moses, on account of the glory of the face of him, that passing away;

8. how not rather the service of the spirit shall be in glory;

9. if for the service of the condemnation, glory; much more abounds the service of the righteousness in glory.

10. Even for not has been glorified that having been glorified in this the respect, on account of the surpassing glory.

11. If for that is being annulled, through glory; by much more that remaining, in glory.

12. Having therefore such a hope, much freedom we use;

13. and not, as Moses placed a veil on the face of himself, for the not to gaze intently the sons of Israel to the end of that passing away.

14. (But were blinded the minds of them; till for the today the same veil on the reading of the old covenant, remains, not being discovered, because by Anointed it is taken away;

15. but till today, when is read Moses, a veil on the heart of them lies.

16. When but it may turn to Lord, is taken from around the veil.

17. The but Lord the spirit is; where and the spirit of Lord there freedom.)

18. We but all having been unveiled in a face the glory of Lord beholding as in a mirror, the same image we are transformed from glory to glory, even as from Lord of spirit.

## 2 Corinthians 4

1. On account of this having the service this, even as we received mercy, not we faint;

2. but we refused the secrets of the shame, not walking in craftiness, nor falsifying the word of the God, but by the manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves to every conscience of men, in presence of the God;

3. but even it is having been veiled the glad tidings of us, among those being destroyed it is having been veiled;

4. in whom the God of the age this blinded the minds of the unbelieving ones, in order that not to see distinctly the illumination of the glad tidings of the glory of the Anointed one, who is an image of the God.

5. Not for ourselves we proclaim, but Anointed Jesus a Lord; ourselves and, slaves of you through Jesus.

6. Because the God that commanding out of darkness light to shine, who shone in the hearts of us, for illumination of the knowledge of the glory of the God in face of Jesus Anointed.

7. We have but, the treasure this in earthen vessels, so that the superabounding of the power may be of the God, and not out of us;

8. in everything being afflicted, but not being straitened; being perplexed, but not being in despair;

9. being persecuted, but not being forsaken; being cast down, but not being destroyed;

10. always the putting to death of the Jesus in the body bearing about, that also the life of the Jesus in the body of us may be manifested.

11. Always for we the living, to death are delivered because of Jesus, that also the life of the Jesus may be manifested in the moral flesh of us.

12. So that the death in us works, the but life in you.

13. Having but the same spirit of the faith, according to that having been written: I believed, therefore I spoke; also we believe, therefore and we speak;

14. knowing, that the one raising up the Lord Jesus, also us through Jesus will raise up, and will present with you.

15. The for all things on account of you, that the favor having abounded through the many, the thanksgiving might superabound to the glory of the God.

16. Wherefore not we faint; but if even the outward of us man is wasted, yet the inward is renewed by day and by day.

17. The for momentary lightness of the affliction of us, according to an exceeding on an exceeding agelasting weight of glory works out for us;

18. not looking of us the things being seen, but the things not being seen; the things for being seen, transient things; the things but being seen, agelasting things.

## 2 Corinthians 5

1. We know for, that, if the earthly of us house of the tent should be taken down, a building from God we have, a house not made by hands, agelasting, in the heavens.

2. Even for in this we groan, the abode of us that from heaven to be invested earnestly desiring.

3. If at least and having been invested, not naked ones we shall be found.

4. Indeed for those being in the tent groan being oppressed; in which not we wish to be unclothed, but to be invested, that may be swallowed up the moral by the life.

5. The and one having worked out us for same this God; that also having given to us the pledge of the spirit.

6. Being confident therefore always, and knowing, that being at home in the body, we are from home from the Lord;

7. (by means of faith for we are walking, not by means of sight;)

8. we are confident but, also we are wellpleased rather to be from home out of the body, and to be at home with the Lord;

9. wherefore also we are very ambitious, whether being at home, or being from home, wellpleasing to him to be.

10. The for all us to appear it is necessary before of the tribunal of the Anointed, that may receive each one the things through the body, according to what was practised, whether good, or bad.

11. Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, men we persuade, to God but we have been manifested; I hope and also in the consciences of you to have been manifested.

12. Not for again ourselves do we recommend to you, but opportunity giving to you of boasting on behalf of us; that you may have for those in face boasting, and no in heart.

13. Even if for we are besides ourselves, to God; and if we are of sound mind, to you.

14. The for love of the Anointed constrains us,

15. having judged this, that if one on behalf of all died, then they all died; and on behalf of all he died, that the living no longer to themselves should live, but to him on behalf of them having died and having been raised up.

16. So that we from the now no one know according to flesh; if and even we knew according to flesh Anointed, but now no longer we know.

17. So that if any one in Anointed, new creation; the things old passed away, lo, has become new the all things.

18. The but all things out of the God, that one having reconciled us to himself through Jesus Anointed, and having given to us the service of the reconciliation.

19. Namely that God was in Anointed a world reconciling to himself, not reckoning to them the fruits of them, and having placed in us the world of the reconciliation.

20. On behalf of Anointed therefore we are ambassadors, as if the God beseeching through us; we pray on behalf of Anointed, be you reconciled to the God.

21. Him for not having known sin, on behalf of us sin was made, that we might become righteousness of God in him.

## 2 Corinthians 6

1. Working together but also we exhort, not in vain the favor of the God to receive you;

2. (he says for: In a season acceptable I listened to thee and in a day of salvation I helped thee. Lo, now a season well accepted, lo, now a day of salvation.)

3. No one in any thing giving offence, so that not may be blamed the service;

4. but in every thing establishing ourselves as of God servants, in patience much, in affliction, in necessities, in distresses,

5. in stripes, in prisons, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;

6. in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in spirit holy, in love unfeigned,

7. in a word of truth, in power of God; through the arms of the righteousness of the rights and of lefts,

8. through glory and disgrace, through bad fame and good fame; and deceivers and true;

9. as being ignorant, and being duly appreciated; as dying, and lo we live; as being corrected, and not put to death;

10. as being grieved, always but rejoicing; as poor, many but making rich; as nothing having; and all things possessing.

11. The mouth of us has been opened to you, O Corinthians, the heart of us has been enlarged.

12. Not you are straitened in us; you are straitened but in the bowels of you.

13. The but same recompense, (as to children I speak,) be enlarged also you.

14. Not be you unequally yoking with unbelievers; what for participation righteousness and lawlessness? what and fellowship light with darkness?

15. What and agreement of an Anointed with Belial? or what portion to a believer with an unbeliever?

16. what and connection a temple of God with idols? You for a temple of God are living; as said the God: That I will in dwell among them, and will walk about in; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.

17. Wherefore come you out from midst of them and be you separated, says Lord, and of an unclean thing not touch you; and I will receive you,

18. and I will be to you for a Father, and you shall be to me for sons and daughters, says Lord Almighty.

## 2 Corinthians 7

1. These therefore having the promise, beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in fear of God.

2. Receive you us; no one we injured, no one we corrupted, no one we defrauded.

3. Not for condemnation I speak; before I said for, that in the hearts of us you are in order that to die together and to live together.

4. Much with me boldness towards you, much with me boasting on behalf of you; I have been filled with the consolation, I am overflowing with the joy in all the affliction of us.

5. Indeed for having come of us into Macedonia, not had rest the flesh of us, but in everything being distressed; without fights, within fears.

6. But the one comforting the lowly ones, comforted us the God by the presence of Titus;

7. not only and by the presence of him, but also in the comfort with which he was comforted over you, announcing to us the of you earnest desire, the of you lamentation, the of you zeal on behalf of me; so that me more to have rejoiced.

8. Because if even I grieved you by the letter, not I do repent, if indeed I did repent; I see for that the letter that, if even for an hour, I grieved you.

9. Now I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved in order to reformation; you were grieved for according to God, so that in nothing you might suffer loss from us.

10. The for according to God sorrow reformation for salvation not to be repented of works out; the but of the world sorrow death works out.

11. Lo for same this the thing according to God to have been grieved you, how much it worked in you diligence; but a defence, but indignation, but fear, but earnest desire, but zeal, but punishment; in every thing you proved yourselves pure to be in the matter.

12. Therefore if indeed I wrote to you on account of the one having done wrong; but on account of the one having done wrong; but on account of the to have been manifested the diligence of us that on behalf of you toward you, in presence of the God.

13. On account of this we were comforted on the comfort of you; more abundantly and rather we rejoiced in the joy of Titus, because has been refreshed the spirit of him from all of you;

14. because if anything to him on behalf of you I have boasted, not I was ashamed; but as all things in truth we spoke to you, so also the boasting of us that to Titus, truth became;

15. and the bowels of him more abundantly for you is, remembering the of all of you obedience, as with fear and trembling you received him.

16. I rejoice, that in everything I have confidence in you.

## 2 Corinthians 8

1. We make known but to you, O brethren, the favor of the God that having been given by the congregations of the Macedonia;

2. that in much trial of affliction abundance of the joy of them, and the in deep poverty of them, abounded to the wealth of the liberality of them;

3. because according to power ( testify) and beyond power of their own accord,

4. with much earnest entreaty asking of us the favor even the participation of the service of that for the saints.

5. And not as we expected, but themselves they gave first to the Lord, and to us, through will of God;

6. in order that to intreat us Titus, that as he before began, so also he would perfect among you also the gift this.

7. But as in every thing you abound, (in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all diligence, and in the form of you to us love,) that also in this the favor you may abound;

8. not according to a command I speak, but through of the of others diligence, and that of the your love reality am proving;

9. (you know for the favor of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, that on account of you he became poor rich being, so that you by the of him poverty might become rich;)

10. and an opinion in this I give. This for you to you is profitable, who not alone the to do, but also the to will before began from last year;

11. now but also the to do do you perfect, that as the promptness of the to will, so also the to finish out of the to have.

12. If for the promptness is placed first, according to what may have any one, acceptable, not according to what not he has.

13. Not for, that to others rest, to you but affliction, but out of an equality; in the present season the to you abundance for the of them want,

14. so that also the of them abundance may be for the of you want, so that may be an equality;

15. even as it has been written: He the much, not had over; and he the little, not had lack.

16. Thanks but to the God to the having given the same earnestness on behalf of you in the heart of Titus;

17. because the indeed exhortation he received; more earnest but being, of his own accord he went out to you.

18. We sent together and with him the brother, of whom the praise in the glad tidings through all of the congregations;

19. not only and but also having been voted by the congregation a fellowtraveler of us with the gift this, that being administered by us for the same the Lord glory and readiness of mind of us;

20. avoiding this, not anyone is us should blame in the abundance this the being served by us;

21. we are purposing for good things not only in presence of Lord, but also in presence of men.

22. We sent together and with them the brother of us, whom we proved in many things many times diligent being, now but much more diligent, confidence great in that for you.

23. And if on behalf of Titus, partner my and for you a fellowlaborer; and if brethren of us, apostles of congregations, glory of Anointed.

24. The therefore proof of the love of you, and of us boasting on behalf of you, for them point you out in face of the congregations.

## 2 Corinthians 9

1. Concerning indeed for the service of that for the saints superfluous for me it is the to write to you.

2. I know for the readiness of mind of you, which on behalf of you I am boasting to Macedonians, because Achaia has been prepared from last year; and the from of you zeal stirred up the many.

3. I sent but the brethren, so that not the boasting of us that on behalf of you should be vain in the respect this; so that, as I said, having been prepared may be;

4. lest perhaps if should come with me Macedonians, and find you unprepared, should be ashamed we (that not we may say you) in the confident expectation this.

5. Necessary therefore I thought to exhort the brethren, that they would go before to you, and would make ready before the preannounced blessing of you, this ready to be thus as a blessing, and not as an exaction.

6. This but, the one sowing sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and the one sowing in blessings, in blessings also shall reap.

7. Each one as he purposes in the heart; not from grief, or from necessity; a cheerful for giver loves the God.

8. Powerful but the God every favor to make abound to you, that in every thing always allsufficiency having, you may abound in every work good;

9. even as it has been written: He has dispersed, he gave to the poor ones; the righteousness of him abides for the age.

10. The and one supplying seed to the one sowing and bread for food, will supply and will multiply the sowing of you, and will increase the products of the righteousness of you;

11. in every thing being enriched for all liberality, which works out through us thanksgivings to the God;

12. because the dispensing of the public service this not only is abundantly supplying the wants of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to the God;

13. on account of the proof of the service this they are glorifying the God at the subjection of the profession of you to the glad tidings of the Anointed one, and liberality of the contribution for them and for all,

14. and of them by prayer on behalf of you, ardently loving you, because of the surpassing favor of the God on you.

15. Thanks but to the God for the inexpressible of him free gift.

## 2 Corinthians 10

1. Same and I Paul beseech you on account of the meekness and gentleness of the Anointed, who according to face indeed humble among you, being absent but am bold toward you;

2. I pray but, that not being present to be bold with the confidence, with which I reckon to have daring toward some those reckoning us as according to flesh walking.

3. In flesh for walking, not according to flesh warring.

4. (the for arms of the warfare of us not fleshly, but powerful in the God for a casting down of fortresses,)

5. reasonings casting down and every height raising itself up against the knowledge of the God, and leading captive every mind into the obedience of the Anointed,

6. and in preparation having to punish every disobedience, when may be fulfilled of you the obedience.

7. The things according to face do you see? If any one has persuaded himself of Anointed to be, this let him consider again from himself that even as he of Anointed, so also we.

8. If indeed for even more abundantly somewhat I should boast concerning the authority of us, which gave the Lord to us, for building up and not for casting down of you, not I shall be ashamed.

9. So that not I may seem as I would terrify you by means of the letters;

10. (because the indeed letters, he says, weighty and powerful; the but presence of the body weak, and the word having been despised;)

11. this let consider the such an one, that such ones were by the word through letters being absent, such like ones also being present in the work.

12. Not for we dare to rank or to compare ourselves with some of those themselves commending; but they by themselves themselves measuring, and comparing themselves with themselves, not are intelligent.

13. We and not for the things unmeasured we will boast, but according to the measure of the rule, of which distributed to us the God of measure, to reach to even you.

14. Not for, as not reaching to you, we over stretch ourselves; (to for even you we came in the glad tidings of the Anointed;)

15. not for the things unmeasured boasting in others labors, a hope but having, being increased of the faith of you, by you to be enlarged according to the rule of us into superabundance,

16. to the parts beyond of you to announce glad tidings; not by another rule for the things ready to boast.

17. The but one boasting, in Lord let him boast.

18. Not for he himself commending, he is approved, but whom the Lord commends.

## 2 Corinthians 11

1. I wish you would bear with me a little in the foolishness; but even you do bear with me.

2. I am zealous for you of God with a zeal; I espoused for you to one husband, a virgin pure to present to the Anointed;

3. I fear but, lest as the serpent Eve deceived by the craft of himself, so should be corrupted the minds of you from the simplicity of that into the Anointed.

4. If indeed for the one coming another Jesus proclaims whom not we proclaimed, or spirit another you receive which not you received, or glad tidings other which not you embraced, well you might bear.

5. I reckon for nothing to have been behind those in the highest degree apostles.

6. If but even a simple person in the word, yet not in the knowledge; but in every thing having been manifested in all things among you.

7. Or sin did I commit, myself humbling, so that you might be exalted? because freely the of the God glad tidings I announced to you?

8. Other congregations I robbed, having taken wages for the of you service; and being present with you and having been in want, not did I lazily burden any one;

9. (the for want of me supplied before the brethren having come from Macedonia;) and in every thing unburdensome to you myself I kept, and I will keep.

10. It is a truth of Anointed in me, that the boasting this not shall be stopped concerning me in the regions of the Achaia.

11. Why? because not I love you? The God knows.

12. What but I do, even I will do, so that I may cut off the opportunity of those wishing an opportunity, so that in what they boast, they may be found as even we.

13. The for such ones false apostles workers deceitful, transforming themselves into apostles of Anointed.

14. And not it is wonderful; himself for the adversary is transformed into a messenger of light;

15. not great therefore, if also the servants of him are transformed as servants of righteousness; of whom the end shall be according to the works of him.

16. Again i say, not any one me should think unwise to be; if but otherwise, even as unwise do you receive me, so that even I a little somewhat may boast.

17. What I speak, not I speak according to Lord, but as in foolishness, in this the confidence of the boasting.

18. Since many boast according to the flesh, also I will boast.

19. Willingly for you bear with the unwise, wise ones being;

20. you bear for, if any one you enslaves, if any one eats you up, if any one takes you, if any one raises himself up, if any one you on face beats.

21. According to dishonor I speak, as that we were weak; in what but any one may be bold, (in foolishness I speak,) bold also I.

22. Hebrews are they? also I; Israelites are they? also I; seed of Abraham are they? also I;

23. servants of Anointed are they? (being a very fool I speak,) above I; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;

24. (by Jews five times forty except one I received,

25. thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I was shipwrecked, a night and day in the deep I have passed;)

26. in journeys often; in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from kindred, in dangers from Gentiles, in dangers in city, in dangers in desert, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brethren;

27. in labor and toil, in watchings often in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

28. Besides the outward things, the crowding of me that every day, the care of all of the congregations.

29. Who is weak, and not I am weak? who is made to stumble, and not I burn?

30. If to boast is necessary, the things of the weakness of me I will boast.

31. The God and Father of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed knows, he being blessed for the ages, that not I utter falsehood;

32. in Damascus the ethnarch Aretas of the king guarded the Damascenes city, to seize me wishing;

33. and through an opening in a rope basket I was lowered through the wall, and escaped the hands of him.

## 2 Corinthians 12

1. To boast indeed not is profitable for me; I will come for to visions and revelations of Lord.

2. I know a man in Anointed, above years fourteen, (whether with a body, not I know; or without the body, not I know; the God knows;) having been snatched away the such a one to third heaven.

3. And I know the such a man, (whether in a body, or without the body not I know; the God knows;)

4. that he was snatched away into the paradise, and heard indescribable things spoken, which not being possible for a man to speak.

5. Concerning the such a one I will boast; on behalf but of myself not I will boast; if not in the weaknesses of me.

6. If for I should desire to boast, not I shall be unwise; truth for I will say: I forbear but, lest any one to me should impute beyond what he sees me, or hears anything from of me.

7. And by the transcendency of the revelations that I not I should overelated, was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger adversary, that me it might buffet, that not I might be overelated.

8. Concerning this thrice the Lord I entreated, that it might be removed from me;

9. and he said to me: Is enough for thee the favor of me; the for power of me in weakness is perfected. Most gladly therefore rather I will boast in the weaknesses of me, so that may dwell upon me the power of the Anointed.

10. Wherefore I am wellpleased with weaknesses, with insults, with necessities, with persecutions, with distresses on behalf of Anointed; when for I may be weak, then strong I am.

11. I have become unwise; you me have constrained. I for ought by you to be commended; nothing for I was behind those in highest degree apostles, if even nothing I am.

12. The indeed signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in signs and prodigies and powers.

13. What for it is which you were inferior beyond the other congregations, if not that myself I not was burdensome to you? Forgive to me the injustice this.

14. Lo, a third time this in readiness I am to come to you, and not I will burden you; not for I seek the things of you, but you. Not for it is fitting the children for the parents to treasure up, but the parents for the children.

15. I but most gladly will spend and will be utterly spent on behalf of the souls of you; if even more abundantly you loving, less I am loved.

16. Let it be so but; I not did burden you; but being crafty, with guile you I took.

17. Not any one of whom I have sent to you, through him I overreached you?

18. I exhorted Titus, and I sent with the brother, not overreached you Titus? not in the same spirit we walked? not in the same steps?

19. Again do you think, that to you we apologize? In presence of the God, in Anointed, we speak. But all things, beloved ones, on behalf of the you build up.

20. I am afraid for, lest perhaps having come not such ones I wish I should find you, and I should found by you such a one not you wish, lest perhaps strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evilspeakings whisperings, puffings up, disturbances;

21. lest again having come me should humble the God of me before you, and I should lament over many of those having previously sinned, and not having reformed in respect to the impurity and fornication and lewdness, which they practiced.

## 2 Corinthians 13

1. Third time this I come to you; in mouth of two witnesses and of three shall be established every word.,

2. I have said before and I tell beforehand, (as being present,) the second time, (and being absent now,) to those having previously sinned and to the others to all, that if I should come to the again, not I will spare.

3. Since a proof you seek of the in me speaking Anointed, (who towards you not is weak, but is powerful in you;

4. even for if he was crucified from weakness, yet he lives from power of God; also for we are weak with him, but we shall live with him from power of God towards you;)

5. yourselves try you, if you are in the faith; yourselves prove you. Or not do you know yourselves, that Jesus Anointed in you is? if not without proof you are.

6. I hope but that you will know, that we not are without proof.

7. I wish but to the God, not to do you evil nothing; not that we approved ones may appear, but that you the good may do, we but as without proof may be.

8. Not fort we have power any against the truth, but on behalf of the truth.

9. We rejoice for, when we may be weak, you but strong ones may be; this but even we wish, the of you restoration.

10. On account of this these things being absent I write, so that being present not severity I may use, according to the authority, which gave to me the Lord for building up, and not for pulling down.

11. Lastly, brethren, rejoice you, be you restored, be you comforted, the same think you, be you at peace; and the God of the love and peace shall be with you.

12. Salute you each other with a holy kiss;

13. salute you the saints all.

14. The favor of the Lord Jesus Anointed, and the love of the God, and the joint participation of the holy spirit with all of you.
