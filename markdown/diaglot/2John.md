## 2 John 1

1. The elder to a chosen Lady, and to the children of her, whom I love in truth, (and not I only; but also all those knowing the truth,)

2. on account of the truth that abiding in us, and with us shall be for the age;

3. will be with you favor, mercy, peace from God a Father, and from lord Jesus Anointed the son of the Father, in truth and love.

4. I rejoiced greatly, because I have found of the children of thee walking in truth, as a commandment we received from her Father.

5. And now I entreat thee, Lady, not as a commandment writing to thee new, but which we had from beginning, that we should love each other.

6. And this is the love, that we should walk according to the commandment of him. This is the commandment, as you heard from beginning, that in it you should walk.

7. Because many deceivers entered into the world, who not confessing Jesus Anointed coming in flesh; this is the deceiver and the antichrist.

8. See you yourselves, that not we may lose the things we performed, but a reward full we may receive.

9. Every one the transgressing, and not abiding in the teaching of the Anointed, God not has; the one abiding in the teaching of the Anointed, this both the Father and the son has.

10. If any one comes to you, and this the teaching not brings, not you do receive him into house, and health him not says you.

11. The for one saying to him health partakes in the works of him in the evil ones.

12. Many things having to you to write, not I wished by means of paper and of ink; I hope for to come to you, and mouth to mouth speak, so that the joy of us may be having been perfected.

13. Salute thee the children of the sister of thee the chosen one.
