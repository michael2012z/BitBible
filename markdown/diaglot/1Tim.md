# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Anointed, according to an appointment of God, a saviour of us, and Anointed Jesus, of the hope of us,

2. to Timothy a genuine child in faith; favor, mercy, peace from God a Father of us, and Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.

3. As I entreated thee to remain in Ephesus, departing for Macedonia, that thou mayest charge some not other to teach,

4. nor to hold to fables and genealogies endless, which disputes occasion rather than an administration of God that by faith;

5. (the now end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and conscience good and faith unfeigned;

6. which some having missed, turned aside to foolish talking,

7. wishing to be lawteachers, not understanding neither the things they say, nor concerning certain things they positively affirm.

8. We know but, that good the law, if one it lawfully may use,

9. knowing this, that for a just one a law not is laid down, for lawless ones but and for unruly ones, for ungodly ones and sinners, for impious ones and for profane ones, for smiters of fathers and for smiters of mothers, for mankillers,

10. for fornicators, for sodomites, for manstealers, for liars, for oathbreakers, and if anything other to the sound teaching is opposed,

11. according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God, which was entrusted with I;

12. and give thanks I to the one having empowered me Anointed Jesus the Lord of us, because faithful me he regarded, placing into service,

13. him formerly being a defamer and a persecutor and a violent person; but I received mercy, because being ignorant I acted in unbelief,

14. superabounded but the favor of the Lord of us with faith and love of that in Anointed Jesus.

15. True the word, and of all reception worthy, that Anointed Jesus came into the world sinners to save, of whom first am I;

16. but through this I received mercy, that in me first might show forth Jesus Anointed the all forbearance, for an example of those being about to believe on him for life agelasting;

17. to the now King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, only God, honor and glory for the ages of the ages; so be it.)

18. This the charge I commit to thee, child O Timothy, according to the preceding in respect to thee prophecies that thou mayest war by them the good warfare,

19. holding faith and good a conscience, which some having thrust away, concerning the faith were shipwreck;

20. of whom is Hymenius and Alexander, whom I delivered up to the adversary, so that they might be taught not to revile.

## 1 Timothy 2

1. I exhort therefore first of all to make supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings in behalf of all men;

2. in behalf of kings, and of all of those in high station being; so that a tranquil and quiet life we may lead in all piety and seriousness.

3. This for good and acceptable in presence of the preserver of us God,

4. who all men wishes to be saved, and into in exact knowledge of truth to come.

5. One for God, one and mediator of God and of men, a man Anointed Jesus,

6. he having given himself a ransom in behalf of all; the testimony for seasons own,

7. for which was placed I a herald and an apostle, (truth I speak, not I speak falsely,) a teacher of nations in faith and in truth.

8. I direct therefore to pray the men in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputing.

9. In the same way and the women in apparel becoming, with modesty and soundness of mind, to adorn themselves, not with wreaths, of gold, or pearls or garment expensive,

10. but, (which in becoming for women undertaking worship of God,) by means of works good.

11. A woman in quietness let learn with all submission.

12. A women but to teach not I permit, nor to assume authority over a man, but to be in silence.

13. Adam for first was formed, then Eve.

14. And Adam not was deceived; the but woman having been deceived, in transgression became;

15. she will be preserved but through the childbearing, if they abide in faith and love and holiness with sobriety of mind.

## 1 Timothy 3

1. True the word: If any one an oversight long after, excellent a work he desires.

2. It behooves then the overseer unblamable to be, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sedate, orderly, hospitable, fit to teach;

3. not a wine drinker, not a striker, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money;

4. of the own house well presiding, children having in subjection with all dignity;

5. (if but any one of the own house to preside not knows, how a congregation of God will he take care off?)

6. not a new convert, so that not being puffed up into a judgment he may fall of the accuser;

7. it behooves but him also a testimony good to have from those outside, so that not into reproach he may fall and a snare of the accuser.

8. Servants in like manner dignified, not twoworded, not to wine much being addicted, not eager for base gain,

9. holding the secret of the faith in a pure conscience.

10. Also these but let be proved first, then let serve, unblamable being.

11. Women in like manner serious, not accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.

12. Servants let be of one wife a husband, children well presiding over and of the own houses.

13. Those for well having served, a standing for themselves honorable they acquire, and much confidence in faith in that in Anointed Jesus.

14. These things to thee I write, hoping to come to thee very soon;

15. if but I should delay, that thou mayest know, know it behooves in a house of God to conduct thyself, which is a congregation of God living.

16. A pillar and basis of the truth and confessedly great is the of the piety secret. Who was manifested in flesh, was justified in spirit, was seen by messengers, was proclaimed among nations, was believed among a world, was taken up in glory.

## 1 Timothy 4

1. The but spirit expressly says, that in subsequent seasons will fall away some from the faith, adhering to spirits wandering and to teachings of demons,

2. by hypocrisy of falsespeakers, having been cauterized the own conscience,

3. forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods, which the God created for a partaking of with thanksgiving by the faithful ones and they have known the truth.

4. Because every creature of God good, and nothing cast away, with thanksgiving being received;

5. it is sanctified for through a word of God and of prayer.

6. These things setting forth to the brethren, good thou wilt be a servant of Jesus Anointed, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teachings, which thou hast closely followed.

7. The but profane and old women fables do thou avoid; discipline but thyself for piety.

8. The for bodily discipline for a little it is profitable; the but piety for all things profitable it is, a promise having of life of the now and of that about coming.

9. True the word and of all acceptance worthy.

10. In order of this and we toil and are reproached, because we have hoped in God living, who is a preserver of all men, especially of believers.

11. Do thou enjoin these things and do thou teach.

12. No one thee the youth let despise, but a pattern become thou of the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.

13. Till I come, attend thou to the reading, to the exhorting, to the teaching.

14. Not be thou neglectful of the in thee endowment, which was given to thee through prophecy, with laying on the hands of the eldership.

15. These things do thou care for, in these things be thou; so that of thee the progress manifest may be in all things.

16. Attend thou to thyself, and to the teaching; continue thou in them; this for doing, both thyself thou wilt save and those hearing thee.

## 1 Timothy 5

1. An elderly man not thou mayest chide, but exhort as a father; younger men, as brothers;

2. elderly women, as mothers; younger women, as sisters, in all purity.

3. Widows honor, those really widows.

4. If but any widow children or grandchildren has, let them be taught first the own house to be dutiful, and a recompense to render to the progenitors; this for is acceptable in presence of the God.

5. She but really a widow and having been left alone she hoped in the God, and continues in the supplications and in the prayers night and day;

6. she but luxuriously, living has died.

7. And these things enjoin, so that unblamable ones they may be.

8. If but any one for those of own, and especially of the household, not provides, the faith has denied, and is an unbeliever worse.

9. A widow let be enrolled not less of years sixty, having become, of one husband a wife,

10. by works good being attested; if she reared a family, if she received strangers, if of holy ones feet she washed, if afflicted ones she relieved, if every work good she closely followed.

11. Younger but widows reject; when for they may be wanton towards the Anointed, to marry they wish;

12. having condemnation, because the first fidelity they violated;

13. at the same time and also idle ones they learn to go about the houses; not only but idle ones, but also praters and busy bodies, speaking the things not proper.

14. I wish therefore younger ones to marry, to bear children, to keep house, no opportunity to give to the opponent of reproach on account.

15. Already for some turned aside after the adversary.

16. If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let such support them, and not let burden the congregation, so that those really widows may be relieved.

17. The well presiding elders double honor let be esteemed worthy; especially those toiling in word and teaching.

18. Says for the writing: An ox trending not thou shalt muzzle; and, worthy the laborer of the hire of himself.

19. Against an elder an accusation not do thou receive, without if not by two or three witnesses.

20. The sinning ones, in presence of all reprove thou, so that also the remainder fear may have.

21. I solemnly enjoin in presence of the God and Lord Jesus Anointed and of the chosen messengers, that these things thou mayst keep without prejudice nothing doing by partiality.

22. Hands hastily to no one do thou put and not do thou share in sins with others. Thyself pure do thou keep.

23. No longer be thou a water drinker, but wine a little do thou use on account of the stomach of thee and the frequent of thee weaknesses.

24. Of some men the sins previously manifest are, before leading to judgment; in some but indeed they fellow after.

25. In like manner also the good works previously manifest are; and the things otherwise being, to be hidden not are able.

## 1 Timothy 6

1. As many as are under a yoke slaves, the own masters of all honor worthy let them esteem, that not the name of the God and the teaching may be reviled.

2. Those and believing having masters, not let them disregard, because brethren they are; but rather let them serve, because believing ones they are and beloved ones who of the welldoing are recipients. These thing do thou teach, and do thou exhort.

3. If any one teach differently, and not assents to being sound in words in those of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, and so that according to piety teaching;

4. he is puffed up, nothing being versed in, but being sick about questions and strifes of words, out of which arises envy, strife, evilspeakings, suspicions wicked,

5. wrangling having been corrupted of men the mind, and having been devoid of the truth, supposing gain to be the piety. withdraw thyself from of the such ones.

6. It is but gain great the piety with a competency.

7. Nothing for we brought into the world; evident, that neither to carry out any thing are we able.

8. Having and foods and coverings, with these things we shall be satisfied.

9. Those but wishing to be rich, fall into a temptation and a snare, and desires many foolish and hurtful, which sink deep the men into destruction and ruin.

10. A root for of all of the evils is the love of money; which some longing after wandered from the faith, and themselves pierced around with sorrows many.

11. Thou but, O man of the God, these things flee; pursue thou and righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, meekness;

12. contest thou the good contest of the faith, do thou lay hold of the agelasting life, for which thou wast called out, and thou didst confess the good confession in presence of many witnesses.

13. I charge thee in presence of the God, of that making alive the things all, and Anointed Jesus, of that one testifying before Pontius Pilate the good confession,

14. to keep thee the commandment spotless, blameless, till the appearance of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed,

15. which in seasons own he will show the blessed and only Potentate, the King of those being kings and Lord of those being lords,

16. the only one having deathlessness, light dwelling in inaccessible, whom saw no one of men, nor to see is able; to whom honor and might agelasting; so be it.

17. To those rich ones in the present age do thou charge not to be highmined, nor to have confidence in wealth uncertain, but in the God the living, in that offering to us all things richly for enjoyment;

18. to work good, to be rich in works good, liberal ones to be, communicative ones,

19. treasuring up for themselves a foundation good for the future, so that they may lay hold of that really life.

20. O Timothy, the trust guard thou, avoiding the profane empty sounds and oppositions of the falselynamed knowledge; which some having professed, concerning the faith missed the mark. The favor with thee.
