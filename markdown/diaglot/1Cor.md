## 1 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, called an apostle of Jesus Anointed, through will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,

2. to the congregation of the God to that being in Corinth, having been sanctified in Anointed Jesus, called saints with all those calling upon the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed in every place, of them both and of us;

3. favor to you and peace from God Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed.

4. I give thanks to the God of me always concerning you, for the favor of the God for that having been given to you in Anointed Jesus;

5. that in every thing you were enriched in him, in every word and all knowledge,

6. (when the testimony of the Anointed was confirmed among you;)

7. so that you not to be inferior in any one gracious gift, waiting for the revelation of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed;

8. who also will confirm you to an end irreproachable ones in the day of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.

9. Faithful the God, through whom you were called into fellowship of the son of him Jesus Anointed, the Lord of us.

10. I entreat and you, brethren, through the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, that the same thing you speak all, and not may be among you divisions, you may be but knit together in the same mind and in the same sentiment.

11. It was declared for to me concerning you, brethren of me, by those of Chloe, that contentions among you are.

12. I say and this, because each one of you says: I indeed am of Paul; I but, of Apollos; I and, of Cephas; I and, of Anointed.

13. Has been divided the Anointed? not Paul was crucified on behalf of you? or into the name of Paul were you dipped?

14. I give thanks to the God, that no one of you I dipped, if not Crispus and Gaius;

15. so that not any one may say, that into the my name I dipped.

16. I dipped and also the Stephanas house; remainder not I know, if any other I dipped.

17. Not for sent me Anointed to dip, but to announce glad tidings; not in wisdom of speech, so that not may be of no effect the cross of the Anointed.

18. The word for that of the cross to those indeed being destroyed foolishness is, to those but being saved to us power of God it is.

19. It has been written for: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the learning of the intelligent ones I will set aside.

20. Where a wise man? where a scribe? where a disputer of the age this? Not did make foolish the God the wisdom of the world this?

21. When for in the wisdom of the God not knew the world through the wisdom the God, was pleased the God, through the foolishness of the proclamation to save those believing.

22. Although and Jews signs are asking, and Greeks wisdom are seeking;

23. we yet proclaim an Anointed having been crucified, to Jews indeed a stumblingblock, to Gentiles and foolishness;

24. to those but to the called ones, Jews both and Greeks, Anointed of God power and of God wisdom.

25. Because the foolishness of the God, wiser of the man is; and the weakness of the God, stronger of the men is.

26. You see for the calling of you, brethren, that not many wise ones according to flesh, not many strong ones, not many wellborn;

27. but the foolish things of the world chose the God, that the wise ones he may shame; and the weak things of the world chose the God, that he may shame the powerful ones;

28. and the lowborn of the world and the things having been despised chose the God, and the things not existing, that the things existing he may bring to nothing;

29. so that not may boast all flesh in presence of the God.

30. Out of him but you are in Anointed Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness also and sanctification and redemption;

31. so that, even as it has been written: He boasting, in Lord let him boast.

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. And I having come to you, brethren, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of the God.

2. Not for I determined any thing to make known among you, if not Jesus Anointed, and this having been crucified.

3. And I in weakness, and in fear and in trembling much was with you;

4. and the speech of me and the preaching of me not in persuasive wisdom of words, but in a display of spirit and of power;

5. so that the faith of you not may be in wisdom of men, but in power of God.

6. Wisdom but we speak among the perfect ones. Wisdom but not of the age this, nor of the rulers of the age this, of those coming to an end;

7. but we speak of God wisdom in a mystery, that having been hidden, which previously marked out the God before the ages, for glory of us;

8. which no one of the rulers of the age this has known; (if for they knew, not would the Lord of the glory they crucified;)

9. but, even as it has been written: What things eye now saw, and ear not heard, and to heart of man not ascended, what prepared the God for those loving him.

10. To us but revealed the God through the spirit of himself; the for spirit all things searches, even the depths of the God.

11. Who for knows of men the things of the men, if not the spirit of the man that in him? so also the things of the God no one knows, if not the spirit of the God.

12. We but not the spirit of the world received, but the spirit that from God, that we may know the things by the God having been graciously given to us;

13. which things also we speak, not by teachings of human wisdom in words, but by teachings of spirit, to spiritual ones spiritual things explaining.

14. An animal but man not receives the things of the spirit of the God; foolishness for to him it is, and not he is able to know; because spiritually it is examined.

15. The but spiritual man examines indeed all things, himself but by no one is examined.

16. Who for knew mind of Lord, who will instruct him? We but mind of Anointed have.

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And I, brethren, not was able to speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as to fleshly ones, even as to babes in Anointed.

2. Milk you I gave to drink, not solid food; not yet were you able. But not even yet now are you able;

3. yet for fleshly ones you are. Where for among you envy and strife and divisions, not fleshly ones you are, and according to man walk you?

4. When for may say any one: I indeed am of Paul; another and: I, of Apollos; not fleshly ones are you?

5. Who then is Paul, who and Apollos? Servants, through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave.

6. I planted, Apollos watered, but the God caused to grow;

7. so neither he planting is anything, nor he watering, but he causing to grow God.

8. He planting but and he watering one are; each and the own reward will receive according to the own labor.

9. Of God for we are fellowworkers; of God a farm, of God a building you are.

10. According to the favor of the God that having been given to me, as a wise architect a foundation I have laid; another but builds up; each one but let see, how he builds up.

11. Foundation for another no one is able to have laid besides that being laid, who is Jesus Anointed.

12. If but any one builds on the foundation this gold, silver, stones costly, wood, hay, straw;

13. of each one the work manifest shall become; the for day will show, because in fire it is revealed; and of each one the work what kind it is, the fire will try.

14. If of any one the work abides which he built up, a reward he will receive;

15. if of any one the work shall be consumed, he will suffer loss; he himself but shall be saved, in this way but as through fire.

16. Not know you, that a temple of God you are, and the spirit of the God dwells in you?

17. If any one the temple of the God destroys, will destroy him the God; the for temple of the God holy is, who ever are you.

18. No one himself let deceive; if any one seems wise to be among you in the age this, a fool let him become, so that he may become wise.

19. The for wisdom of the world this, foolish with the God is; it has been written for: He is catching the wise ones in the craftiness of them;

20. and again: Lord knows the reasonings of the wise ones, that they are vain.

21. Therefore no one let boast in men; all things for of you is,

22. whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or world, or life, or death, or present things, or being about to be; all things of you is;

23. you and, of Anointed; Anointed and, of God.

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. Thus us let regard a man, as assistants of Anointed, and stewards of mysteries of God.

2. What but remaining, it required in the stewards, that faithful one should be found.

3. To me but for least thing it is, that by you I should be condemned, or by a human day; but not even myself do I condemn;

4. (nothing for in myself I am conscious, but not in this I have been justified;) he but condemning me, Lord is.

5. Therefore not before proper season any thing judge you, till may come the Lord, who both will bring to light the things hidden of the darkness, and will make manifest the purposes of the hearts; and then the praise shall be to each one from the God.

6. These and, brethren, I figuratively applied to myself and Apollos on account of you, that by us you may learn that not above what has been written to think, so that not one on behalf of the one you may be puffed up against the other.

7. Who for thee distinguishes? what and hast thou, which not thou didst receive? if and also thou didst receive, why dost thou boast as not having received?

8. Already having been filled you are, already you were rich, without us you reigned; and I wish indeed you did reign, no that also we with you might reign together.

9. I think for that the God us the apostles last set forth, as appointed to death, because a spectacle we were made to the world and messengers and to men.

10. We fools on account of Anointed, you but wise ones in Anointed; we weak ones, you but strong ones; you honorable ones, we but ignoble ones.

11. Till the present hour both we hunger, and we thirst, and we are naked, and we are beaten, and we are homeless,

12. and we labor working with the own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;

13. being blasphemed, we exhort; as purgations of the world we became, of all things offscraping till now.

14. Not shaming you I write these things, but as children of me beloved I admonish.

15. If for myriads childtenders you may have in Anointed, but not many fathers; in for Anointed Jesus through the glad tidings I you begot.

16. I exhort therefore you, imitators of me become you.

17. On account of this I sent you Timothy who is a child of me beloved and faithful in Lord, who you will remind the ways of me those in Anointed, even as every where in every congregation I teach.

18. As not coming but of me to you, were puffed up some.

19. I will come but quickly to you, if the Lord should will, and I will know not the word of those having been puffed up, but the power;

20. not for in word the kingdom of the God, but in power.

21. What do you wish? with a rod I should come to you, or in love in a spirit and of meekness?

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. Actually is heard among you fornication, and such fornication, which not even among the Gentiles, as a wife one of the father to have.

2. And you having been puffed up are? and not rather lamented, so that might be removed from midst of you he the work this having done?

3. I indeed for as being absent in the body, being present but in the spirit, already have judged as being present, him thus this having practiced,

4. in the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed (having been assembled of you and of the my spirit,) with the power of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed,

5. to deliver up that one to the adversary for destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6. Not good the boasting of you. Not know you, that a little leaven whole the mass leavens?

7. Cleanse out the old leaven, that you may be new mass, as you are unleavened; even for the paschal lamb of us on behalf of us was slain, Anointed.

8. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with leaven old, nor with leaven of vice and wickedness, but with unleavened things of sincerity and of truth.

9. I wrote to you in the letter, not to be associated with fornicators.

10. And not altogether with the fornicators of the world this, or with the covetous ones, or extortioners, or idolaters; since you are bound indeed from the world to come out.

11. Now but I wrote you, not to be associated, if any one, a brother being named, may be a fornicator, or a covetous person, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with the such like not even to eat;

12. what for to me also those without to judge? Not those within you judge?

13. Those but without the God will judge. Put out the evil one from of yourselves.

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Dare any one of you, a matter having with the other, to be judged by the unjust ones, and not by the saints?

2. Or not know you, that the saints the world will judge? and if by you is judged the world, inadequate are you for tribunals smallest?

3. not know you, that messengers we shall judge? much more then things of this life?

4. Things of this life indeed then judgments if you may have, those having been no account in the congregation, those do you cause to sit?

5. For shame to you I speak; thus not one among you wise not even one, who shall be able to decide between the brethren of himself?

6. but a brother with brother is judged, and this by unbelievers?

7. Already indeed then certainly a fault to you it is, that lawsuits you have with yourselves. Why not rather suffer injustice? why not rather be defrauded?

8. But you injure, and defraud, and these things brethren.

9. Or not know you, that unjust ones of God a kingdom not shall inherit? Not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminates, nor Sodomites,

10. nor thieves, nor covetous persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, not extortioners, a kingdom of God not shall inherit.

11. And these things some you were; but you washed yourselves, but you were separated, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, an in the spirit of the God of us.

12. All things to me is lawful, but not all things is beneficial; all things to me it lawful, but not I will be brought to subjection by any one.

13. The foods for the belly, and the belly for the foods; the but God both this and these will make useless. The and body not for the fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;

14. the and God both the Lord raised up, and us will rise up through the power of himself.

15. Not know you, that the bodies of you members of Anointed is? having taken away then the members of the Anointed, shall I make of an harlots members? not let it be.

16. Or not know you, that the one being joined to the harlot, one body is? (they shall be for, it says, the two for flesh one;)

17. the but one being joined to the Lord, one spirit is?

18. Flee you the fornication. All sins which if may do a man, outside of the body is; he but committing fornication against the own body sins.

19. Or not know you, that the body of you a temple of the in you holy spirit is, which you have from God, and not you are of yourselves?

20. You were brought for a price; glorify you therefore the God in the body of you.

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. Concerning but what things you wrote to me, good for a man a woman not to touch;

2. on account of but the fornications each man the of himself wife let have, and each woman the own husband let have.

3. To the wife the husband the debt let render; in like manner and also the wife to the husband.

4. The wife of the own body not controls, but the husband; in like manner and also the husband the own body not controls, but the wife.

5. Not do you deprive each other, if not from agreement for a season, so that you may be at leisure for the prayer; and again to the same you may be, so that not may tempt you the adversary through the incontinence of you.

6. This but I say as a concession, not as a injunction.

7. I wish for all men to be as even myself; but each own has gift from God, one indeed so, another and so.

8. I say but to the unmarried and to the widow; good for them, if they should remain as even I;

9. if but not they possess selfcontrol, let him marry; better for it is to have married, than to be inflamed.

10. To those but having been married I charge, not I, but the Lord, a wife from an husband not to be separated.

11. (if but even she should be separated, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband let her be reconciled;) and a husband a wife not to dismiss.

12. To the but remaining things I speak, not the Lord; if any brother a wife has an unbeliever, and she thinks well to dwell with him, not let him dismiss her;

13. and a wife who has a husband an unbeliever, and he thinks well to dwell with her, not let her dismiss him.

14. Has been sanctified for the husband the unbelieving in the wife, and has been sanctified the wife the unbelieving in the husband; otherwise indeed the children of you unclean is, now but holy is.

15. If but the unbelieving withdraws, let him withdraw; not is enslaved the brother or the sister with the such like. In but peace has called us the God.

16. How for knowest thou, O wife, if the husband thou shalt save? or how knowest thou, O husband, if the wife thou shalt save.

17. If not to each other as distributed the Lord, each one even as has called the God so let him walk. And thus in the congregations all I appoint.

18. Having been circumcised any one who called, not let him be uncircumcised; in uncircumcision any one was called, not let him be circumcised.

19. The circumcision nothing is, and the uncircumcision nothing is, but keeping of commandments of God.

20. Each one in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.

21. A slave wast thou called, not to thee let it be a care; but if also thou art able free to become, rather use.

22. He for in Lord being called a slave a freedman of Lord is; in like manner also the freeman being called, a slave is of Anointed.

23. For a price you were bought; not become you slaves of men.

24. Each one in which he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.

25. Concerning and the virgins, a commandment of Lord not I have; a judgment but I give, as having obtained mercy from Lord faithful to be.

26. I declare then, this well to be because of the having been present distress, that well for a man the true to be.

27. Art thou having been bound to a wife, not seek thou a release; hast thou been loosed from a wife, not seek thou a wife.

28. If but even thou shouldst have married, not thou didst sin; and if should have married the virgin, not she sinned; affliction but in the flesh shall have those such like; I but you spake.

29. This but I say, brethren, the season having been shortened the remainder is; that both those having wives, as not having should be;

30. and those weeping; as not weeping; and those rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and those buying, as not possessing;

31. and those using the world this, as not abusing. Passes by for the form of the world this.

32. I wish but you free from anxieties to be. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;

33. hew but having married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.

34. Has been divided the wife and the virgin; the unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, so that may be holy both in body and in spirit; the but one having married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please the husband.

35. This and for the of you yourselves benefit I say; not that a snare to you I may throw, but for the decorum and devotedness to the Lord without solicitude.

36. If but any one to behave indecently toward the virgin of himself thinks, if she may be beyond age, and to it is fitting to be; what he wishes let him do, not he sins; let them marry.

37. Who but he has stood settled in the heart, not having necessity control but has concerning the own will, and this has resolved in the the heart of himself the to keep the himself virgin, well does.

38. So that even he giving in marriage, well does; and he not marrying, better does.

39. A wife is bound for so long time may live the husband of her; if but should fall asleep the husband of her, free she is to whom she wills to be married, only in Lord.

40. Happier but she is, if thus she should remain according to the my judgment; I think and even I spirit of God to have.

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. Concerning and the things offered to idols, we know; (because all knowledge we have; the knowledge puffs up, the but love builds up;

2. if but any one thinks to have known something, not yet nothing he has known as it behooves to have known;

3. if but any one should love the God, this has been acknowledged by him;)

4. concerning the eating therefore of the things offered to idols, we know, that nothing an idol in world, and that no one God other, if not one.

5. Indeed for though they are being called gods, whether in heaven, or on earth, (as they are gods many, and idols many;)

6. but to us one God the Father, out of whom the all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Anointed, through whom the all things, and we through him.

7. But not in all the knowledge; some but in conscience of the idols till now as offered to an idol they eat, and the conscience of them, weak being, is defiled.

8. Food but us not brings near to the God; neither for if we should eat, do we abound; nor if not we would eat, are we deficient.

9. Look you but, least in any way the liberty of you this a stumblingblock may become to those being weak.

10. If for any one may see thee, the one having knowledge, in an idoltemple reclining, not the conscience of him, weak being, will be build up in order that the things offered to idols to eat?

11. and will be destroyed the being weak brother by the thy knowledge on account of whom Anointed died.

12. Thus but sinning against the brethren and smiting of them the conscience being weak, against Anointed you sin.

13. Wherefore if food ensnares the brother of me, not I may eat flesh to the age, so that not the brother of me I may ensnare.

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Not am I a freeman? not am I an apostle? Not Jesus Anointed the Lord of us have seen? not the work of me you are in Lord?

2. If to others not I am an apostle, at all events to you I am; the for seal of the my apostleship you are in Lord.

3. The my defence to those me condemning, this is.

4. Not not have we a right to eat and to drink?

5. Not not have we a right a sister a wife to lead about, as also the others apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

6. Or only I and Barnabas not have we a right of the not to work?

7. Who serves in war with his own wages any time? who plants a vineyard, and from of the fruit of it not eats? or who tends a flock, and from of the milk of the flock not eats?

8. Not according to man these things I speak? or not and the law these things says?

9. In for the Moses law it has been written: Not thou shalt muzzle an ox threshing. Not for the oxen cares the God?

10. or on account of us altogether he says? On account of us for it was written, because in hope it is right he plowing to plow; and he threshing, in hope of that to partake.

11. If we to you the spiritual things sowed, a great thing, if we of you the fleshly things shall reap?

12. If others of the of you right partake, not rather we? But not we did use the right this; but all things we endure, so that not hindrance any we may give to the glad tidings of the Anointed.

13. Not know you, that those the holy things performing, from of the temple eat? those to the altar attending, with the altar are partakers?

14. Thus also the Lord has appointed for those the glad tidings proclaiming, from of the glad tidings to live.

15. I but not have used not one of these things. Not I did write and these things, that thus it may be done to me; well for to me rather to die, than the boasting of me that any one should make void.

16. If for I may announce glad tidings, not it is to me a cause of boasting; necessity for to me lies on; woe for to me is if not I should preach glad tidings.

17. If for willing this I do, a reward I have; if but unwilling, a stewardship I have been entrusted with.

18. What then to me is the reward? So that announcing glad tidings without expense I will place the glad tidings of the Anointed, in order that not to fully use the authority of me in the glad tidings.

19. Free for being from all, to all myself I was enslaved, that the more I might gain;

20. and I became to the Jews as a Jew, that Jews I might gain; to those under law as under law, (not being myself under law,) that those under law I might gain;

21. to those without law as without law, (not being without law to God, but within law to Anointed,) that I might gain lawless ones;

22. I became to the weak as weak, that the weak ones I might gain; to them all I have become the all things, that by all means some I may save.

23. This but I do on account of the glad tidings, that a copartner of it I may become.

24. Not know you, that those in a racecourse running, all indeed run, one but receives the prize? Thus run you, that you may obtain.

25. Every one but the contending, all things possesses selfcontrol; they indeed therefore, that a perishable wreath they may receive; we but, an imperishable.

26. I therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; thus I box, as not air beating;

27. but I browbeat of me the body and lead it captive, lest possibly to others having proclaimed, myself without proof should become.

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. Not I wish for you to be ignorant, brethren, that the fathers of us all under the cloud were, and all through the sea, passed,

2. and all into the Moses were dipped in the cloud and in the sea,

3. and all the same food spiritual did eat,

4. and all the same drink spiritual did drink; (they drank for from spiritual following a rock; the but rock was the Anointed);

5. but not with the greater number of them was wellpleased the God; they were laid prostrate for in the desert.

6. These things but types of us were made, in order that not to be us lusters of evil things, as even they lusted.

7. Nor imageworshippers become you, as some of them; as it has been written: Sat down the people to eat and to drink, and stood up to sport.

8. Nor should we fornicate, as some of them fornicated, and fell in one day twentythree thousands.

9. Nor should we tempt the Anointed, as also some of them tempted, and by the serpents were destroyed.

10. Nor murmur you, as also some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.

11. These things and all types happened to them; was written and for admonition of us, on whom the ends of the ages met.

12. So that the one thinking to have stood, let him take care lest he should fall.

13. A temptation you not has taken if not being belonging to man; faithful but the God, who not will permit you to be tempted above what you are able, but will make you with the temptation also the way out, that you may be able to bear up under.

14. Wherefore, beloved ones of me, flee you from the imageworship.

15. As to wise men I speak, judge you what I say.

16. The cup of the blessing which we bless, not a participation of the blood of the Anointed is it? the loaf which we break, not a participation of the body of the Anointed is it?

17. Because one loaf, one body the many we are; these for all from of the one loaf partake.

18. See you the Israel according to flesh; not those eating the sacrifices partakers of the altar are?

19. because an idol anything is? or because an idol sacrifice anything is?

20. But, because what sacrifice the Gentiles, to demons they sacrifice, and not to God; not I wish and you partakers of the demons to become.

21. Not you are able a cup of Lord to drink and a cup of demons; not you are a table of Lord to partake and a table of demons.

22. Or do we provoke to jealously the Lord? not stronger of him we are?

23. All things it is lawful, but not all things are beneficial; all things it is lawful, but not all things builds up.

24. No one that of himself let him seek, but that of the other.

25. Every thing that in market is being sold eat you, not asking questions, on account of the conscience;

26. of the Lord the earth and the fulness of her.

27. If but any one invites you the unbelieving, and you wish to go, everything that is being presented to you eat you, not asking questions, on account of the conscience.

28. If but any one to you should say: This an idol sacrifice is; not eat you on account of him the one having disclosed, and the conscience.

29. Conscience now I say, not that of thyself, but that of the other. Why for the freedom of me is judged by another conscience?

30. If I by favor partake, why am I blamed on account of which I give thanks?

31. Whether then you eat, or you drink, or anything you do, all things for glory of God do you.

32. Not causes of stumbling become you both to Jews and Greeks and to the congregation of the God;

33. even as also I all things all men please, not seeking that of myself being profitable, but that of the many, that they may be saved.

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Imitators of me become you, even as also I of Anointed.

2. I praise and you, brethren, because all things of me you have remembered, and as I delivered to you the traditions you retain.

3. I wish but you to have knowledge, that of every man the head the Anointed is; head but of woman, the man; head but of Anointed, the God.

4. Every man praying or prophesying upon head having, disgraces the head of himself.

5. Every but woman praying or prophesying uncovered with the head, disgraces the head of herself; one for it is and the same with the having been shaven.

6. If for not is covered a woman, also let her hair be cut off; if but a disgrace to a woman the hair to be cut off or to be shaven let her be covered.

7. A man indeed for not it is fitting to be covered the head, a likeness and glory of God being; a woman but glory of a man is;

8. not for is man from woman, but woman from man;

9. even for not was created man on account of the woman, but woman on account of the man.

10. On account of this it is fitting the woman authority to have on the head, on account of the messengers.

11. But neither woman without man, nor man without woman, in Lord.

12. As for the woman from the man, so also the man through the woman; the but all things out of the God.

13. In yourselves judge you; becoming is it a woman uncovered to the God to pray?

14. Or not even herself the nature teaches you, that a man indeed if he should wear long hair, a disgrace to him it is?

15. A woman and if should wear long hair, a glory to her it is? because the hair instead of a cover has been given to her.

16. If but any one thinks contentious to be, we such like custom not have, nor the congregations of the God.

17. This but announcing not I praise, because not for the better, but for the worse you come together.

18. First indeed for, being come together of you in an assembly, I hear divisions among you to be; and of a part certain I believe;

19. it is necessary for also heresies among you to be, so that the approved ones manifest may become among you.

20. Coming together therefore of you to the same, not it is Lords supper to eat,

21. each one for the own supper takes before in the to eat, and one indeed is hungry, one but is filled.

22. Not for houses not have you for the to eat and to drink? or the congregation of the God despise you, and shame you those not having? What to you may I say? shall I praise you? In this not I praise.

23. I for received from the Lord, what also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took a loaf,

24. and having given thanks he broke, and said: This of me is the body that on behalf of you being broken; this do you for the my remembrance.

25. In like manner also the cup, after the to have supped, saying: This the cup the new covenant is in the my blood; this do you, as often as you may drink, for the my remembrance.

26. As often as for you may eat the loaf this, and the cup this you may drink, the death of the Lord you announce till of whom may come.

27. So that who may eat the loaf, or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, an offender against will be the body and the blood of the Lord.

28. Let examine but a man himself, and thus from of the loaf let him eat, and from of the cup let him drink;

29. the for one eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself eats and drinks, not discerning the body of the Lord.

30. Through this among you many weak ones and sickly ones, and are asleep some.

31. If for ourselves we examined, not we should be judged;

32. being judged but by Lord, we are corrected, so that not with the world we should be condemned.

33. Therefore, brethren of me, being come together for the to eat, each other you receive from.

34. If any one should be hungry, in a house let him eat; that not for judgment you may come together. The but other things, when I may come, I will arrange.

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. Concerning and the spirituals, brethren, not I wish you to be ignorant.

2. You know, that Gentiles you were, to the idols those speechless, even as you might be led, being hurried away;

3. wherefore I declare to you, that no one by spirit of God speaking, says a curse Jesus; and no one is able to say Lord Jesus, if not by a spirit holy.

4. Varieties and of gracious gifts are, the but same spirit;

5. and varieties of services are, and the same Lord;

6. and varieties of inworking are, the but same God, who is working the all things in all.

7. To each one but is given the manifestation of the spirit to the benefit;

8. to one indeed for through the spirit is given a word of wisdom, to another and a word of knowledge, according to the same spirit;

9. to another and faith, by the same spirit; to another and gracious gifts of cures, by the same spirit;

10. to another and inworkings of powers, to another and prophecy, to another and discernings of spirit, to another and kinds of tongues, to another and an interpretation of tongues.

11. All but these things works that one and the same spirit, distributing particularly to each one as it wills.

12. Just as for the body one is, and members has many, all but the members of the body of the one, many being, one is body; thus also the Anointed.

13. Even for in one spirit we all into one body were dipped; whether Jews, or Greeks, whether slaves, or freeman; and all into one spirit were made to drink.

14. Also for the body not is one member, but many.

15. If should say the foot: Because not I am a hand, not I am from of the body; not from this not is it from of the body?

16. And if should say the ear: Because not I am an eye, not I am from of the body; not from this not is it from of the body?

17. If whole the body an eye, where the hearing? if whole hearing, where the small?

18. Now but the God placed the members, one each of them in the body, as he would.

19. If but was the all one member, where the body?

20. Now but many indeed members, one but body.

21. Not is able the eye to say to the hand: Need of thee not I have; or again the head to the feet: Need of you not I have.

22. But much more the seeming members of the body more feeble to be, necessary it is;

23. and those we think less honorable to be of the body, to these honor more abundant we place around; and the uncomely parts of us comeliness more abundant has;

24. the but comely parts of us, no need has. But the God combined the body, to the part being inferior more abundant having given honor,

25. so that not many be division in the body, but the same on behalf each other may be concerned the members.

26. And whether suffers one member, suffers with all the members; or is glorified one member, rejoices with all the members.

27. You but are a body of Anointed, and members from parts.

28. And these indeed placed the God in the congregation first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that powers, then gracious gifts of cures, helpers, directors, kinds of tongues.

29. Not all, apostles? not all, prophets? not all, teachers? Not all, powers?

30. Not all, gracious gifts have of cures? not all, with tongues speak? not all interpret?

31. You earnestly desire but the gracious gifts those better. And yet a more excellent way to you, I point out.

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. If with the tongues of the men I speak and of the messengers, love but I have, I have become brass sounding or a cymbal noisy.

2. And if I have prophecy, and I know the secrets all and all the knowledge, and id I have all the faith, so that mountains to remove, love but not have, nothing I am.

3. And if I bestow all the possessions of me, and if I should give the body of me so that it should be burned, love but not have, nothing I am profited.

4. The love suffers long, is gentle; the love not envies; the love not is boastful, not is puffed up,

5. not acts unbecomingly, not seeks the things of herself, not is provoked to anger, not imputes the evil,

6. not rejoices in the iniquity, rejoices with but the truth,

7. all things covers, all things believes, all things hopes, all things endures;

8. the love not at any time falls off; whether but prophecies, they will be done away whether tongues, they will cease; whether knowledge, it will be done away.

9. From parts for we know, and from parts we prophesy;

10. when but may come the prefect, then that from parts will be done a way.

11. When I was a babe, as babe I spoke, as a babe I thought, as babe reasoned; since but I have become a man, I have put away the things of the babe.

12. We see for now through a glass in an enigma, then but face to face; now I know from parts, then but I shall know fully even as and I fully known.

13. Now but abides faith, hope, love, the three these; greater but of these the love.

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Pursue you the love; earnestly desire but the spirituals, rather but that you may prophesy.

2. The for one speaking with a tongue, not to men speaks, but to the God; no one for hears, in spirit but he speaks mysteries;

3. the but one prophesying, to men speaks edification and exhortation and consolation.

4. The one speaking with a tongue, himself build ups; the but one prophesying, a congregation builds up.

5. I wish and all you to speak with tongues, rather but that you may prophesy; greater for the one prophesying than the one speaking with tongues, unless if not he should interpret, so that the congregation edification may receive.

6. Not but, brethren, if I should come to you with tongues speaking, what you shall I profit, if not to you I shall speak either in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in a prophesy, or in teaching?

7. In like manner the things without life a sound giving, whether a flute, or a harp, if a difference to the notes not they should give, how shall be known that being played on flute or that being played on harp?

8. Also for if an uncertain sound a trumpet should give, who will prepare himself for battle?

9. So also you through the tongue if not a wellmarked word you give, how shall be know that having been spoken? you will be for into air speaking.

10. So many, if it may be, kinds of voices is in world, and no one of them unmeaning.

11. If then not I know the power of the voice, I shall be to the one speaking a barbarian; and the one speaking, to me a barbarian.

12. So also you, since zealots you are for spirits, for the building up of the congregation seek you that you may abound.

13. Wherefore the one speaking in a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.

14. If for I pray in a tongue, the spirit of me prays, the but mind of me unfruitful is.

15. What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray but also with the understanding; I will sing praise with the spirit I will sing praise but also with the understanding.

16. Otherwise, if thou shouldst bless with the spirit, the one filling the place of the private person how shall say the so be it on the thy thanksgiving? since what thou sayest not he knows.

17. Thou indeed for well givest thanks; but the other not built up.

18. I give thanks to the God, all of you more with tongues, speaking;

19. but in a congregation I wish five words through the understanding of me to have spoken, that also others I may instruct, then a myriad words in a tongue.

20. Brethren, not children become you in the mind; but in the evil be you child like, in the and minds perfect ones become you.

21. In the law it has been written: That by other tongues and by lips others I will speak to the people this, and not even so will they listen to me, says Lord.

22. So that the tongues for a sign are, not to those believing, but to the unbelievers; the but prophesies not to the unbelieving, but to those believing.

23. If therefore should come together the congregation whole to the same, and all with tongues should speak, should come in and unlearned ones, or unbelievers, not will they say, that you are mad?

24. If but all should prophesy, should come in and any one unbelieving, or unlearned, he is convinced by all, he is examined by all,

25. the secrets of the heart of him manifest become; and so falling on a face he will worship the God, announcing, that the God really among you is.

26. Why then is it, brethren? When you may come together, each one of you a psalm has, teaching has, a tongue has, a revelation has, an interpretation has; all things for building up let it be done.

27. If with a tongue any one speaks, by two, or the most three, and in succession; and one let interpret.

28. If but not may be an interpreter, let him be silent in congregation; to himself but let him speak and to the God.

29. Prophets but two or three let speak, and the others discern;

30. if but to another may be revealed sitting by, the first let be silent.

31. You are able for one by one all to prophesy, that all may learn, and all may be comforted;

32. and spirits of prophets to prophets are subject;

33. not for is of confusion the God, but of peace. As in all the congregation of the saints,

34. the women of you in the congregation let be silent; not for it has been permitted to them to speak, but to be submissive, as even the law says.

35. If and anything to learn they wish, in a house the own husbands let them ask; an indecent thing for it is women in congregation to speak.

36. Or from you the word of the God went out? or to you alone did it come?

37. If any one thinks a prophet to be or spiritual, let him acknowledge the things I write you, because of Lord they are commandments;

38. if but any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant.

39. So that, brethren, be you zealous that to prophesy, and that to speak with tongues not hinder you;

40. all things but in a becoming manner and according to order let be done.

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. I declare but to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced as glad tidings to you, which also you received, in which also you have stood,

2. through which also you are being saved; (by a certain word I announced as glad tidings to you if you retain;) except if not inconsiderately you believed.

3. I delivered for to you among first things what also I received; that Anointed died on behalf of the sins of us, according to the writings;

4. and that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day, according to the writings;

5. and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.

6. After that he was seen above by five hundred brethren at once, out of whom the greater number remain till now, some but also have fallen asleep.

7. After that he was seen by James; then by the Apostles all.

8. Last and of all, just as if by the abortion, he was seen also by me.

9. (I for am the least of the apostles; who not am fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the congregation of the God.

10. By favor but of God I am what I am; and the favor of him that to me, not vain was made, but more abundantly of them all I labored; not I but, but the favor of the God that with me.)

11. Whether therefore I, or they, thus we proclaim, and thus you believed.

12. If but Anointed is proclaimed, that out of dead ones has been raised, how say some among you, that a resurrection of dead ones not is?

13. If but a resurrection of dead ones not is, not even Anointed has been raised;

14. if but Anointed not has been raised, void then the preaching of us, void and also the faith of you.

15. We are found and even false witnesses of the God; because we testified concerning the God, that he raised up the Anointed, whom not he raised up, if indeed dead ones not are raised up.

16. If for dead ones not are raised up, not even Anointed has been raised;

17. if but Anointed not has been raised; deceptive the faith of you; still you are in the sins of you;

18. then also those having fallen asleep in Anointed, perished.

19. If in the life this having been hoping we are in Anointed alone, more pitiable of all men we are.

20. Now but Anointed has been raised up out of dead ones, a firstfruit of those having fallen asleep.

21. Since for through a man the death, also through a man a resurrection of dead ones.

22. As for in the Adam all die, so also in the Anointed all will be made alive.

23. Each one and in the own band; a firstfruit Anointed, after that those of the Anointed, in the presence of him;

24. then the end, when he should have delivered up the kingdom to the God and Father, when he should have abrogated all government and all authority and power.

25. It behooves for him to reign, till he may have placed all the enemies under the feet of him.

26. Last enemy is rendered powerless the death;

27. all things for he subjected under the feet of him. When but it may be said, that all things have been subjected, it is evident, that is excepted the one having subjected to him the all things.

28. When but may be subjected to him, the all things, then also himself the son will be subject to the one having subjected to him the all things so that may be the God the all things in all.

29. Otherwise what shall they do those being dipped on behalf of the dead ones, if at all dead ones not are raised up? why and are they dipped on behalf of them?

30. Why and we are in danger every hour?

31. Every day I die, by the your boasting, which I have in Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.

32. If according to man I fought with a wild beast in Ephesus, what to me the profit? if dead ones not are raised up, we may eat and we may drink; tomorrow for we die.

33. Not be you led astray. Corrupt habits virtuous companionships evil.

34. Awake you as it is fit, and not sin you; ignorance for of God some have; for shame to you I speak.

35. But will say some one: How are raised up the dead ones? in what and body do they come?

36. O foolish one; thou what sowest, not is made alive, if not it should die;

37. and what thou sowest, not that body that going to be born thou sowest, but a naked grain, if it may happen, of wheat, or some of the others;

38. the but God to it gives a body as he willed, and to each of the seeds the own body.

39. Not all flesh, the same flesh; but one indeed of men, another and flesh of cattle, another and of fishes, another but of birds.

40. And bodies heavenly, and bodies earthly; but one indeed that of the heavenlies glory, another and that of the earthlies.

41. One glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars; a star for from a star differs in glory.

42. Thus and the resurrection of the dead ones. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;

43. it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a body soulical, it is raised a body spiritual.

44. Is a body soulical, and is a body spiritual.

45. So and it has been written: Was made the first man Adam into a soul living; the last Adam into a spirit lifegiving.

46. But not first the spiritual, but the soulical; afterwards the spiritual.

47. The first man, from earth earthy; the second man, the Lord from heaven.

48. Of what kind the earthy, such like also the earthy ones; and of what kind the heavenly, such like also the heavenly ones;

49. and even as we bore the image of the earthy, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.

50. This and I say, brethren, that flesh and blood a kingdom of God to inherit not are able, nor the corruption the incorruption shall inherit.

51. Lo, a mystery to you I speak: All indeed not we shall be asleep; all but which we shall be changed,

52. in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, in the last trumpet. (It shall sound for, and the dead ones shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.)

53. It is necessary for the incorruptible this to be clothed with incorruption, and the mortal this to be clothed with immortality.

54. When but the corruptible this shall be clothed with incorruption, and the mortal this shall be clothed with immortality, then will happen the word that having been written: Was swallowed up the death into victory.

55. Where of thee, O death, the sting? where of thee, O unseen, the victory?

56. The but sting of the death, the sin; the and power of the sin, the law.

57. To the but God thanks, to the one having given to us, the victory through the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.

58. Wherefore, brethren of me beloved, steadfast be you, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing, that the labor of you not is vain in Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. Concerning and the collection that for the saints, as I appointed to the congregations of the Gentiles, so also you do.

2. Every first of week each one of you by itself let him place, treasuring up, what thing he may be prospered; so that not when I may come, then collections may be made.

3. When and I may arrive, whom if you may approve, by letters these I will send to carry the gift of you to Jerusalem;

4. if but it may be be worthy of the even me to go, with me they shall go.

5. I will come but to you, when Macedonia I may have passed through; (Macedonia for I pass through;)

6. with you and it may happen I will remain, or even I shall winter, so that you me may send before where if I may go.

7. Not I wish for you now in passing by to see; I hope for time some to remain with you, if the Lord should permit.

8. I shall remain but in Ephesus till the pentecost;

9. a door for to me has been opened great and effective, and opposers many.

10. If and should have come Timothy, see you, that without fear he may be to you; the for work of Lord he works as even I;

11. I not any one therefore him may despise. Send on before and him in peace, so that he may come to me; I expect for him with the brethren.

12. Concerning and Apollos the brother, much I entreated him, that he would go to you with the brethren, and at all not was will, that now he should go; he will go but, when he may find opportunity.

13. Watch you, stand you firm in the faith, be you manly, be you strong;

14. all things of you in love let it be done.

15. I entreat and you, brethren; you know the household of Stephanas, that it is a firstfruit of the Achaia, and for service to the saints they devoted themselves;

16. that also you should be submissive to the such like persons, and to every one to the one working with and laboring with.

17. I rejoice but on the presence of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because the of you want these supplied;

18. they refreshed for the my spirit and that of you. Acknowledge therefore the such like persons.

19. Salute you the congregations of the Asia. Salute you in Lord much Aquila and Priscilla, with the in house of them congregation.

20. Salute you the brethren all. Salute you each other with a kiss holy.

21. The salvation with the my hand of Paul.

22. If any one not has affection for the Lord Jesus Anointed, let him be accursed; the Lord comes.

23. The favor of the Lord Jesus Anointed, with you.

24. The love of me with all of you in Anointed Jesus. So be it.
