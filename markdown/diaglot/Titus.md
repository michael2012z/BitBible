# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul a bondman of God, an apostle but of Jesus Anointed, (according to faith of chosen ones of God and a knowledge of truth of that according to piety,

2. in hope of life agelasting, which promised the not false God before times agelasting, Titus

3. manifested but in seasons own the word of himself, by a proclamation which was entrusted with I according to an appointment of the saviour of us God,)

4. to Titus a genuine child according to common faith; favor, mercy, peace from God a Father, and Lord Jesus Anointed the saviour of us.

5. Of this cause I left thee in Crete so that the things wanting thou mightest rectify, and thou mightest constitute in each city elders, as I to thee have orders;

6. if any one is irreproachable, of one wife a husband, children having believing, not under an accusation of profligacy, or of insubordination.

7. It behooves for the overseer irreproachable to be, as of God a steward; not selfindulgent, not passionate, not a wine drinker, not a striker, not eager for base gains,

8. but a friend to strangers, a friend to goodness, prudent, just, holy, selfgoverned,

9. holding fast of the according to the teaching true word, so that able he may be both to exhort by the teaching by that sound and those speaking against to confute.

10. Are for many and unruly ones, foolish talkers and deceivers, especially those of circumcision,

11. whom it is necessary to muzzle; who whole houses overturn, teaching the things not proper, of base gain of account.

12. Said one from of them own of them a prophet; Cretans always liars, evil wild beasts, gluttons idle.

13. The testimony this is true; for which cause reprove them severely, so that they may be sound in the faith,

14. not holding to Jewish fables, and commandments of men turning away from the truth. Titus

15. All things indeed pure to the pure ones; to those but having been defiled and unfaithful ones nothing pure, but has been defiled of them both the mind and the conscience.

16. God they profess to have known, by the but works they deny, abominable ones being and disobedient ones, and as to every work good worthless ones.

## Titus 2

1. Thou but speak the things becoming to the wholesome teaching;

2. aged men vigilant ones to be, serious ones, prudent ones, sound ones in the faith, in the love, in the patience;

3. agedwomen in like manner in deportment becoming what is sacred, not accusers, not to wine much enslaved, good teachers.

4. so that they may wisely influence the young women, husbandlovers to be, childrenlovers,

5. prudent ones, pure ones, housekeepers, good ones, being submissive to the own husbands, that not the word of the God may be evil spoken of.

6. The younger men in like manner do thou exhort to be prudent;

7. concerning all things thyself exhibiting a pattern of good works, in the teaching incorruptness, seriousness,

8. speech sound, not to be condemned so that he from of opposition may be ashamed, nothing having concerning us to say evil.

9. Slaves, to own masters to be submissive, in all things wellpleasing to be, not contradicting;

10. not purloining, but fidelity entire showing good; so that the teaching of the saviour of us of God they may adorn in all things.

11. Shone forth for the favor of the God that saving for all men,

12. admonishing us, so that having renounced the impiety and the worldly desires, prudently and righteously and piously we may live in the present age;

13. waiting for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and savior of us Jesus Anointed;

14. who gave himself on behalf of us, so that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and might purify for himself a people peculiar, zealous of good works.

15. There speak thou and exhort thou and reprove thou with all strictness; no one of thee let disregard.

## Titus 3

1. Do thou remind them to governments and authorities to be submissive, to obey rulers, as to every work good ready to be,

2. no one to speak evil of, not quarrelsome to be, gentle, all showing mildness to all men. Titus

3. Were for formerly also we, senseless ones, disobedient ones, erring ones, being enslaved to inordinate desires and pleasures various, in malice and envy passing through, odious ones, hating each other.

4. When but the kindness and the love to man shone forth of the preserver of us of God, Titus

5. not from of works of those in righteousness which did we, but according to of himself mercy he saved us, through a bath of a new birth, and a renovation of spirit holy,

6. of which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Anointed the saviour of us,

7. so that having been justified by the of him favor, heirs we might become according to a hope of life agelasting.

8. True the word; and respecting these things I wish thee to affirm strongly, so that they may be careful of good works to excel those having believed in the God. These is the things good and profitable to the men;

9. foolish but questions and genealogies and strifes and fightings about law; they are for unprofitable and vain.

10. A factious man after a first and second admonition do thou reject;

11. knowing, that has been perverted the such a one, and sins, being selfcondemned.

12. When I shall send Artemas to thee or Tychicus, earnestly endeavor to come to me to Nicopolis; there for I have decided to winter.

13. Zenas the lawyer and Apollos diligently send on before, so that nothing to them may be lacking.

14. Let and also the ours of good works to excel for the pressing wants, so that not they may be unfruitful.

15. Salute thee those with me all; salute thou those loving us in faith. The favor with all of you.
