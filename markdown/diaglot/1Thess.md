# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God a Father and Lord Jesus Anointed; favor to you and peace from God a Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed.

2. We give thanks to the God always concerning all of you, a remembrance of you making in the prayers of us,

3. unceasingly recollecting of you of the work of the faith, and of the labor of the love, and of the patient endurance of the hope of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, in presence of the God and Father of us;

4. knowing, brethren beloved by God, the election of you;

5. because the glad tidings of us not came to you in word only, but also in power, even with spirit holy, and with confirmation much; as you know what we were among you on account of you.

6. And you imitators of us became and of the Lord, having received the word in affliction much with joy of spirit holy;

7. so that to have become you patterns to all to those believing in the Macedonia and in the Achaia.

8. From you for has been sounded forth the word of the Lord not only in the Macedonia and in the Achaia, but also in every place the faith of you that towards the God has gone forth; so that not necessary us to have to speak anything.

9. Themselves for congregation us declare, what kind introduction we had to you, and how you turned to the God from the idols, to serve God living and true;

10. and to wait for the son of him from the heavens, whom he raised out of the dead ones, Jesus, the one delivering us from the wrath of that coming.

## 1 Thessalonians 2

1. Yourselves for you know, brethren, the introduction of us that to you, because not in vain it has been;

2. but having previously suffered and having been injuriously treated, as you know, in Philippi, we were emboldened by the God of us to speak to you the glad tidings of the God with much striving.

3. The for exhortation of us not from error, nor from impurity, nor in deceit;

4. but as we have been approved by the God to be entrusted with the glad tidings, so we speak, not as men pleasing, but the God that one trying the hearts of us.

5. Neither for any time with a word of flattery did we come, as you know; nor with a pretence of covetousness, God a witness;

6. nor seeking from men glory, neither from you nor from others; (being able with a weight to be, as of Anointed apostles;)

7. but we were gentle in midst of you. As would cherish a nursingmother the of herself children,

8. so, being very desirous of you, we were wellpleased to have imparted to you not only the glad tidings of the God, but also the of yourselves lives, because beloved ones to us you have become.

9. You remember for, brethren, the labor of us and the toil; night and day working for the not to burden any one of you, we published to you the glad tidings of the God.

10. You witnesses and the God, how piously and justly and blamelessly with you the believers we were;

11. as also you know, how one each of you, as a father children of himself, exhorting you and consoling,

12. and testifying in order that to walk you worthily of the God, of the one calling you for the of himself kingdom and glory.

13. On account of this also we give thanks to the God unceasingly, because receiving a word of hearing from us of the God, you received, not a word of men, but, as it is truly, a word of God, which also inworks in you the believing ones.

14. You for imitators became, brethren, of the congregations of the God of those being in the Judea in Anointed Jesus, because the things same you suffered also you by the own countrymen, as also they by the Jews;

15. of those also the Lord having killed Jesus and the prophets, and us persecuted, and God not pleasing, and to all men contrary;

16. forbidding us to the Gentiles to speak that they might be saved, in order that to have filled up of themselves the sins always. Has come but on them the wrath for an end.

17. We but, brethren, having been bereaved from you for a season an hour, in face, not a heart, more earnestly we endeavored the face of you to see with much desire.

18. Therefore we wished to come to you. (I indeed Paul,) even once and twice; and the thwarted us the Adversary.

19. What for of us hope or joy or crown of boasting, or not also you, in presence of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed in the of him presence?

20. you for are the glory of us and the joy.

## 1 Thessalonians 3

1. Wherefore no longer holding out, we thought well to be left in Athens alone,

2. and we sent Timothy, the brother of us and fellowworker of the God in the glad tidings of the Anointed, in order that to confirm you and to exhort you in behalf of the faith of you,

3. that no one to be shaken by the afflictions these; (yourselves, for you know, that for this we are placed;

4. indeed for when with you we were, we previously said to you, that we are about to be afflicted, even as also it happened and you know;)

5. on account of this also I no longer holding out, I sent in order the to know the faith of you lest perhaps tempted you the tempter, and in vain should become the toil of us.

6. Just now but, having come Timothy to us from you, and having brought glad tidings to us the faith and the love of you, and because you have remembrance of us good always, longing us to see, even as also we you;

7. through this we were comforted, brethren, over you in all the affliction and distress of us, on account of the of you faith;

8. because now we live, if you stand firm in Lord.

9. What for gratitude are we able to the God to return concerning you, for all the joy with which we rejoice on account of you in presence of the God of us?

10. night and day more exceedingly entreating for the to see of you the face, and to supply the things wanting of the faith of you.

11. Himself but the God and Father of us, and the Lord of us Jesus Anointed may direct the way of us to you;

12. you but the Lord cause to be full and to overthrow with the love to each other and to all, even as also we to you;

13. in order that to be established of you the hearts blameless in holiness in presence of the God even a Father of us, at the coming of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with all of the holy ones of himself.

## 1 Thessalonians 4

1. Finally therefore, brethren, we entreat you and we exhort in Lord Jesus, as you received from us the how it behooves you to walk and to please God, so that you may abound more;

2. you know for, what commands we gave to you by the Lord Jesus.

3. This for is will of the God, the sanctification of you; to abstain you from the fornication;

4. to have known each one of you the of himself vessel to possess in satisfaction and honor,

5. not in passion of inordinate desire, as even the Gentiles those not knowing the God;

6. that not to overstep and cheat in the matter the brother of himself; because an avenger the Lord concerning all these things, as also we before said to you and fully testified.

7. Not for did call us the God for impurity, but in sanctification.

8. Therefore the one setting aside, not man sets aside, but the God, that also having given the spirit of himself the holy to us.

9. Concerning but the brotherly love, no need you have to write to you; yourselves for you God taught are into the to love each other;

10. also for you do it to all the brethren those in whole the Macedonia. We exhort but you, brethren, to abound more;

11. and to strive earnestly to be quiet, and to do the things your own, and to work with the own hands of you, as to you we commanded;

12. so that you walk becomingly towards those outside, and of nothing need may have.

13. Not we wish but you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those having fallen asleep, so that not you may grieve, as even the others those not having a hope.

14. If for we believe, that Jesus died and arose, so and the God those having slept through the Jesus will lead out with him.

15. This for to you we may say by word of Lord, that we the living ones those being left over to the coming of the Lord, not not may precede those having slept.

16. Because himself the lord with a command, with a voice of a chief messenger, and with a trumpet of God will come down from heaven, and the dead ones in Anointed will be raised first;

17. afterwards we the living ones those being left over at the same time with them shall be caught away in clouds for a meeting of the Lord into air; and so always with Lord shall we be.

18. Therefore comfort you each other in the words these.

## 1 Thessalonians 5

1. Concerning but the times and the seasons, brethren, no need you have to you to be written;

2. yourselves for accurately you know, that the day of Lord, as a thief in night, so comes.

3. When they may say: Peace and safety; then sudden to them is at hand destruction, just as the birthpang to her in womb having; and not not can they escape.

4. You but, brethren, not are in darkness, that the day you as a thief should come upon;

5. all for you sons of light are and sons of day; not we are of night, nor of darkness.

6. So then not we may sleep, as even the others, but we should watch and we should not drink;

7. those for sleeping, of night they sleep; and those getting drunk, of night they get drunk.

8. We but, of day being, should not drink, having put on a breastplate of faith and of love, and a helmet, a hope of salvation;

9. because not did set us the God for wrath, but for attaining of salvation by means of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed,

10. of that having died on behalf of us; so that, whether we may be awake or we may be asleep, together with him we may live.

11. Wherefore comfort you each other, and build you up one the other, as even you do.

12. We entreat but you, brethren, to know those toiling among you, and presiding over you in Lord, and admonishing you,

13. and to esteem them superabundantly in love, on account of the work of them; be you at peace among yourselves.

14. We exhort but you, brethren, admonish you the disorderly ones, encourage you the desponding ones, hold you on to the feeble ones, be you longsuffering towards all.

15. See you, no one evil in place of evil to any one should render; but always the good pursue you both towards each other and towards all.

16. Always rejoice you.

17. Unceasingly pray you;

18. in every thing give you thanks; this for will of God in Anointed Jesus concerning you.

19. The spirit not quench you;

20. prophecies not disregard you;

21. all things but try you; the good thing hold you fast;

22. from every form of evil do you abstain.

23. Himself but the God of the peace may sanctify you entirely; and whole of you the spirit and the life and the body blameless in the presence of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed may be preserved.

24. Faithful the one calling you, who also will perform.

25. Brethren, pray you for us.

26. Salute you the brethren all with a kiss holy.

27. I adjure you the Lord, to be read the letter to all the holy brethren.

28. The favor of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with you.
