## Hebrews 1

1. In many parts and in many ways long ago the God having spoken to the fathers by the prophets, in last of the days of these spoke to us by a son,

2. whom he appointed an heir of all things, (on account of whom also the ages he made,)

3. who (being an effulgence of the glory and an exact impress of the substance of him, sustaining and the things all by the word of the power of himself,) through himself a purification have made of the sins of us, sat down at right of the majesty in high places;

4. by so much greater having become of them messengers, by so much more excellent beyond them he has inherited a name.

5. To which for did he say ever of the messengers: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee? and again: I will be to him for a Father, and he shall to me for a son?

6. when but again he may lead in the first born into the habitable, he says: And let worship him all messengers of God.

7. And concerning indeed the messengers he says: He making the messengers of himself spirits, and the public servants of himself of fire a flame;

8. concerning but the son: The throne of thee the god for the age of the ages; a sceptre of rectitude the sceptre of the kingdom of thee.

9. Thou didst love righteousness, and thou didst hate lawlessness; on account of this anointed thee the God of thee, oil of extreme joy beyond the associates of thee.

10. And: Thou in a beginning, O Lord, the earth didst form, and works of the hands of thee are the heavens.

11. They shall perish, thou but remainest; and all as a garment shall become old,

12. and like an upper garment thou wilt fold them, and they shall be changed; thou but the same art, and the years of thee not will fail.

13. To which but of the messengers did he say ever: Do thou sit at right of me, till I may place the enemies of thee footstool for the feet of thee?

14. Not all are public serving spirits, for service being sent forth on account of those being about to inherit salvation?

## Hebrews 2

1. On account of this it behooves more earnestly us to attend to the things having been heard, lest perhaps we should glide away.

2. If for the through messengers having been spoken word was firm, and every deviation and imperfect hearing received a just retribution;

3. how we shall escape so great having disregarded a salvation? which a beginning having received to be spoken through the Lord, by those having heard for us was confirmed,

4. coattesting the God by signs both and by prodigies, and by various powers, and of spirit holy by distributions, according to the of himself will.

5. Not for to messengers he did subject the habitable that about coming, concerning which we speak.

6. Testified but somewhere one, saying: What is man, that thou dost remember him; or a son of man, that thou dost observe him?

7. Thou didst make less him a little while then messengers; with glory and with honor thou didst crown him;

8. all things thou didst place under the feet of him. In for the to be subjected to him the things all, nothing is left to him unsubjected; now but not yet we see to him the things all having been placed.

9. The but a short time than messengers having been made less we see Jesus on account of the suffering of the death with glory and with honor having been crowed; so that by favor of God on behalf of all he might taste of death.

10. It was fitting besides for him, for whom the things all and through whom the things all, many sons into glory leading the prince of the salvation of them through sufferings to perfect.

11. He both for sanctifying and those being sanctified out of one all; for which cause not he is ashamed brethren them to call,

12. saying: I will announce the name of thee to the brethren of me, in midst of a congregation I will praise thee.

13. And again: I will be having trusted in him; and again: Lo, I and the children which to me gave the God.

14. Since then the children have been sharers of flesh and blood, also he in like manner partook of the of them, so that by means of the death he might make powerless him the strength having of the death, that is the accuser,

15. and might set free them as many as by fear of death through all of the life held in were slavery.

16. Not for in any manner of messengers he takes hold, but of seed of Abraham he takes hold.

17. Hence he was obliged in all things to the brethren to be made like, so that merciful he might be and faithful highpriest the things as to the God, in order to the to expiate the sin of the people.

18. By what for he has suffered himself having been tried, he is able to those being tried to render aid.

## Hebrews 3

1. Whence, brethren holy, of a calling heavenly partakers do you attentively regard the apostle and highpriest of the profession of us, Jesus;

2. faithful being to the one having appointed him, as even Moses in (whole) the house of him.

3. Of more for this glory than Moses has been esteemed worthy, so fare as more honor he has of the house the one having built itself.

4. (Every for house is built by some one; he but the things all having built, God.)

5. And Moses indeed faithful in whole to the house of him, as a servant, for a testimony of the things going to be spoken;

6. Anointed but, as a son over the house of him; of whom a house are we, if indeed the confidence and the boasting of the hope till end firm we should hold fast.

7. Therefore, as says the spirit the holy: Today, if the voice of him you will hear,

8. not you should harden the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of the temptation in the desert,

9. not tempted me the fathers of you, proved me, and saw the works of me, forty years;

10. therefore I was provoked with the generation that, and said: Always they wander in the heart; they but not they acknowledged the ways me;

11. so I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me.

12. Take you heed, brethren, lest ever shall be in any one of you a heart evil of unbelief, in the to fall away from God living;

13. but do you exhort yourselves in each day, till of which the today it is called, so that not may be hardened from of you any one by a delusion of the sin.

14. Partakers for of the Anointed we have become, if perhaps the beginning of the confidence till an end firm we would hold fast.

15. In respect to the to be said: Today, if the voice of him you may hear; not harden you the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation.

16. Some for having heard did provoke? but not all those having come out from Egypt by means of Moses?

17. With whom but was he vexed forty years? not with those having sinned? of whom the members fell in the desert.

18. To whom but did he swear not to enter into the rest of himself, if not to those having disbelieved?

19. And we see, that not they were able to enter because of unbelief.

## Hebrews 4

1. We may fear then, lest ever, being left a promise to enter into the rest of him, should seem any one from you to have failed.

2. Also for we were having been addressed with glad tidings, even as also they; but not did profit the word of the hearing them, not having seen been mixed with the faith to those hearing.

3. We enter for into the rest those having believed, as he has said: So I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me; namely from the works from a laying down of a world having been done.

4. It has been spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh thus: And rested the God in the day the seventh from all of the works of himself;

5. and in this again: If they shall enter into the rest of me.

6. Since then it is left some to enter into her, and those formerly having received glad tidings not entered on account of unbelief;

7. again certain he defines a day, Today by David, saying, after so long a time; (as it has been said;) Today, if the voice of him you may hear, not harden you the hearts of you.

8. If for them Jesus caused to rest, not would concerning another have spoken after these of a day.

9. Therefore remains a keeping of a sabbath for the people of the God.

10. The for one having entered into the rest of him, also himself caused to rest from the works of himself, like as from the own the God.

11. We should earnestly endeavor therefore to enter into that the rest, so that not by the same any one example may fail of the unbelief.

12. Living for the word of the God, and energetic, and more cutting beyond every sword twomouthed, even cutting through to a division of life both and of breath, of joints both and of marrows, and able to judge of thoughts and of intentions of heart;

13. and not is a creature out of sight in presence of him, all things but naked and having been laid open to the eyes of him, with whom for us the word.

14. Having therefore a highpriest great, having passed through the heavens, Jesus the son of the God, we should lay hold of the profession.

15. Not for we have a highpriest not being able to suffer with the weaknesses of us, having been tempted but in all things according to a likeness, apart from sin.

16. We should come therefore with confidence to the throne of the favor, so that we may receive mercy, and favor we may find for seasonable help.

## Hebrews 5

1. Every for highpriest from men having been taken, on behalf of men is placed over the things relating to the God, so that he may offer gifts both and sacrifices on behalf of sins;

2. to suffer a measure being able with the ignorant ones and erring ones, since also himself surrounds weakness;

3. and on account of this it is fitting, as concerning the people, so also concerning himself to offer on behalf of sins.

4. And not to himself any one takes the honor, but he being called by the God, as even Aaron.

5. Thus and the Anointed not himself did glorify to become a high priest, but the one having spoken to him: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee;

6. as also in another he says: Thou a priest for the age, according to the order of Melchizedek.

7. Who in the days of the flesh of himself, prayers both and supplications to him being able to deliver him out of death, with a cry strong and tears having offered, and having been heard from the piety,

8. (though being a son, learned, from what things he suffered, the obedience;

9. and having been perfected he became to those obeying him to all a cause of salvation agelasting,

10. having been declared by the God a highpriest according to the order of Melchizedek.

11. Concerning whom great to us the word and hard to be explained to say, since sluggish ones you have become in the hearing.

12. Even for being obligated to be teachers on account of the time, again need you have of the to teach you, certain the elements of the beginning of the oracles of the God; and you have become need having of milk, and not of solid food.

13. Every one for the partaking of milk, unskilled of a word of righteousness; a babe for he is;

14. for perfect ones but is the solid food, for those by the habit the perceptions having been exercised having for a discrimination of good both and evil.

## Hebrews 6

1. Therefore leaving the of the beginning of the Anointed word, towards the perfection we should progress; not again a foundation laying down for reformation from dead works, and of faith in God,

2. of dippings teaching, of laying on and of hands, of a resurrection and of dead ones, and of a judgment agelasting.

3. And this we will do, if may permit the God.

4. Impossible for, those once having been enlightened, having tasted and of the gift of the heavenly, and partakers having become of spirit holy,

5. and good having tasted of God word, powers and about coming of an age,

6. and having fallen away, again to renew for reformation, having crucified again for themselves the son of the God and exposing to shame.

7. Earth for that having drunk the on her often coming rain, and producing herbage useful to them, for whom also it is tilled, receives a blessing from the God;

8. producing but thorns and thistles, rejected and a curse near, of which the end for burning.

9. Having been persuaded but concerning you, beloved ones, the things better and being possessed of salvation, through even thus we speak.

10. Not for unjust the God, to be forgetful of the work of you and of the love, which you manifested for the name of him, having ministered to the holy ones and are ministering.

11. We desire but, each of you the same to show diligence for the full assurance of the hope till an end;

12. so that not sluggish ones you may become, imitators but of those through faith and long endurance are inheriting the promises.

13. To the for Abraham having promised the God, since by no one he had greater to swear, he swore by himself,

14. saying: Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

15. And so having waited long he obtained the promise.

16. Men indeed for by the greater swear, and all to them contradiction and end for confirmation the oath.

17. In which more abundantly wishing the God to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of the purpose of himself, interposed with an oath,

18. so that by two transactions unalterable, in which impossible to deceive God, strong consolation we might have those having fled away to lay hold of the being placed before hope;

19. which as an anchor we have of the life sure both and firm, and entering into the within the vail,

20. where a forerunner on behalf of us entered Jesus, according to the order of Melchizedek a highpriest having become for the age.

## Hebrews 7

1. This for the Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the God of the most high, (the one having met Abraham returning from the smiting of the kings and having blessed him,

2. to whom also a tenth from of all divided Abraham,) first indeed being translated a king of righteousness, then and also a king of Salem, (which is, a king of peace,)

3. without a father, without a mother, without a genealogy, neither a beginning of days nor of life an end having, having been made like but to the son of the God, remains a priest for the continuance.

4. Consider you but, how great this, to whom even a tenth Abraham gave out of the choice spoils, the patriarch.

5. And those indeed from the sons of Levi the priesthood receiving, a commandment have to tithe the people according to the law, this is, the brethren of them, though having come out of the loins of Abraham;

6. he but not deriving an origin from them, has tithed the Abraham, and the one having the promises he has blessed.

7. Without but all contradiction, the less by the greater is blessed.

8. And here indeed tithes dying men receives; there but, being testified that he lives.

9. And so a word to speak, through Abraham even Levi the tithes receiving has been tithed;

10. yet for in the loins of the father he was, when met him the Melchizedek.

11. If indeed then perfection through the Levitical priesthood was; (the people for with her law had received;) what yet need, according to the order of Melchizedek another to arise a priest, and not according to the order of Aaron to be named?

12. Being changed for the priesthood, from necessity also of law a change occurs.

13. Concerning whom for is spoken these things, of a tribe another has been a partaker, from which no one has attended to the altar;

14. evident for, that from Juda has sprung the Lord of us, respecting which tribe nothing concerning priesthood Moses spoke.

15. And more yet evident it is, if according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises a priest another,

16. who not according to a law of a commandment fleshly has become, but according to a power of life enduring.

17. It testifies for: That thou a priest for the age according to the order of Melchizedek.

18. An abrogation indeed for takes places of a preceding commandment, on account of the her weakness and unprofitableness;

19. (nothing for perfected the law;) after introduction but of a better hope, through which we draw near to the God.

20. And in as much as not without swearing; (they indeed for without swearing are priests having become;

21. he but with swearing through the one saying to him: Swore a Lord, and not will change; Thou a priest for the age according to the order of Melchizedek;)

22. by so much better a covenant has become a surety Jesus.

23. And they indeed, many are having become priests, on account of the death to be hindered to continue;

24. he but, on account of the to continue him for the age, unchangeable he has the priesthood;

25. hence and to save for the completely is able those drawing near through him to the God, always living, in order to the interpose in behalf of them.

26. Such for to us was proper a highpriest, holy, free from sin, unstained, having been separated from the sinners, and more exalted of the heavens having become;

27. who not has every day necessity, as the highpriests, first on behalf of the own sins sacrifices to offer, then for those of the people; this for he did at once, himself offered.

28. The law for men appoints highpriests, having weakness; the word but of the swearing of that after the law, a son for to the age having been perfected.

## Hebrews 8

1. A head thing but to those being spoken, such we have a highpriest, who sat down at right of the throne of the majesty in the heavens,

2. of the holy things a public servant, and of the tabernacle of the true, which fixed the Lord, and not man.

3. Every for highpriest in order to the to offer gifts both and sacrifices is appointed; hence necessary, to have something also this which he might offer.

4. If indeed for he was on earth, not even could he be a priest, being of the priests those offering according to the law the gifts;

5. who in an example and in a shadow serve of the heavenlies, even as had been divinely warned Moses, being about to finish the tabernacle: See thou for, he says, thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that having been shown to thee in the mount;)

6. now but more excellent he has obtained a service by as much also of a better he is covenant a mediator, which on better promises has been instituted.

7. If for the first that was faultless, not would a second be seeking a place.

8. Finding fault for to them he says: Lo, days are coming, says a Lord, and I will finish with the house Israel and with the house of Judah a covenant new;

9. not according to the covenant which I made with the fathers of them, in a day having laid hold of me of the hand of them, to lead out them out of land of Egypt; because they not did abide in the covenant of me, and I cared not for them, says a Lord.

10. For this the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after the days those, says Lord, giving laws of me into the mind of them, and on hearts of them I will write them; and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to me for a people.

11. And not not they may teach each one the fellowcitizen of himself, and each one the brother of himself, saying: Know you the Lord; because all shall know me, from least of them even to greatest of them.

12. Because merciful I will be to the unrighteousnesses of them, and of the sins of them and of the iniquities of them not not I will remember more.

13. By the to say new, he has declared old the first; that but becoming old and advancing in age, near disappearing.

## Hebrews 9

1. Had indeed then both the first ordinances of service, the, and holy furnitures.

2. A tabernacle for was prepared the first, in which indeed both a lamp stand and the table and the setting forth of the loaves, which is named holies;

3. behind but the second vail a tabernacle, that being named holies of holies;

4. a golden having censer, and the ark of the covenant having been covered on all sides with gold, in which a pot golden having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that having budded, and the tablets of the covenant;

5. above but her cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercyseat; concerning which things not it is now to speak in part.

6. Of these now thus having been prepared, into indeed the first tabernacle always goes in the priests, the services performing;

7. into but the second once of the year alone the highpriest, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and for the of the people ignorances;

8. this showing of the spirit of the holy, not yet to have been manifested the of the holies way, while of the first tabernacle having a standing;

9. which a parable for the season that having been present, according to which gifts both and sacrifices are offered not being able according to conscience to perfect the one serving,

10. only as to foods and drinks, and various dippings, righteousness, of flesh, till a season of correction is being imposed.

11. Anointed but being come, a highpriest of the future good things, by means of the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made by hand, (that is, not of this the creation,)

12. not indeed by means of blood of goats and young bullocks, by means of but of the own blood entered once for all into the holies, agelasting redemption having found.

13. If for the blood of bulls and of goats, and ashes of a heifer sprinkling the polluted ones, cleanses for the of the flesh purification;

14. how much more the blood of the Anointed one, who by means of a spirit agelasting himself offered spotless to the God, shall cleanse the conscience of you from of death works, for the to serve God living.

15. And on account of this of a covenant new a mediator he is, so that of a death having taken place, for a redemption of the under the first covenant transgressions, the promise might receive those having been called of the agelasting inheritance.

16. Where for a covenant, death necessary to be produced of that having been appointed;

17. a covenant for over dead ones firm, since never it is strong when lives that having been appointed.

18. Hence not even the first without blood has been dedicated.

19. Having spoken for every commandment according to law by Moses to all the people, having taken the blood of the young bullocks and of goats with water and wool scarlet and hyssop, itself both the book and all the people he sprinkled,

20. saying: This the blood of the covenant, which enjoined on you the God;

21. also the tabernacle and and all the vessels of the public service with the blood in like manner he sprinkled.

22. And almost by blood all things are cleansed according to the law, and without bloodshedding not takes place forgiveness.

23. A necessity then the indeed copies of those in the heavens, by these to be cleansed; themselves but the things heavenly with better sacrifices than these.

24. Not for into made by hands holies entered the Anointed, representations of the true ones, but into itself the heaven, now to appear in the presence of the God on behalf of us.

25. Not indeed, that often he should offer himself, even as the highpriest goes into the holies every year with blood other;

26. (since it was necessary him often to have suffered from a laying down of a world;) now but once for all at an end of the ages, for a removal of sin by means of the sacrifice of himself he has been manifested.

27. And as it awaits the men once to die, after but this a judgment;

28. so also the Anointed once for all having been offered for the of many to carry away sins, a second time without sins will be seen, by those him expecting for salvation.

## Hebrews 10

1. A shadow for having the law of the about coming good things, not very the image of the things, every year by the same sacrifices which they offer for the continuance, never is able the ones drawing near to perfect.

2. Otherwise not would they cease to be offered, because that no one to have longer a consciousness of sins those publicly serving, once having been cleansed?

3. but in these a remembrance of sins every year.

4. Impossible for blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins.

5. Therefore coming into the world, he says: Sacrifice and offering not thou didst desire, a body but thou didst provide for me;

6. whole burnt offerings even for sin not thou didst delight in.

7. Then I said: Lo I come, (in a head of a book it has been written concerning me,) of the to do, the God, the will of thee.

8. Above saying: That a sacrifice and offering and whole burnt offerings even for sin not thou didst desires, nor didst delight in; (which according to the law are offered;)

9. then he said: Lo, I come of the to do the will of thee. He takes away the first, so that the second he may establish.

10. By which will having been sanctified we are through the offering of the body of Jesus Anointed once for all.

11. And every indeed priest has stood every day publicly serving, and the same often offering sacrifices, which never are able to take away sins.

12. He but one on behalf of sins having offered a sacrifice, for the continuance sat down at right of the God,

13. thenceforth waiting till may be placed the enemies of him a footstool for the feet of him.

14. By one for offering he has perfected for the continuance those being sanctified.

15. Testifies but to us also the spirit the holy. After for that to have said before;

16. this the covenant, which I will ratify to them after the days those; says a Lord: Giving laws of me in hearts of them, and on the minds of them I will write them,

17. and of the sins of them and of the iniquities of them not not I may remember more.

18. Where now forgiveness of these, no longer offering for sin.

19. Having therefore, brethren, confidence for the entrance of the holies by the blood of Jesus,

20. which he consecrated for us a way recently killed and yet living, through the vail, (that is, the flesh of himself,)

21. and a priest great over the house of the God;

22. let us approach with a true heart in full conviction of faith, having been sprinkled the hearts from a consciousness of evil;

23. and having been bathed the body in water pure, we should hold fast the confession of the hope without declining; (faithful for the one having promised;)

24. and we should bear in mind each other for an excitement of love and of good works,

25. not leaving off the assembling together of ourselves, as a custom with some, but exhorting; and by much more, by so much you see drawing near the day.

26. Voluntarily for sinning of us after the to have received the knowledge of the truth, no longer respecting sins is left a sacrifice;

27. fearful but some expectation of judgment, and of a fire of indignation, to eat up being about the opponents.

28. Having violated any one a law of Moses, without mercies by two or three witnesses dies;

29. by how much, think you, worse will he be deserving punishment he the son of the God having trampled on, and the blood of the covenant a common thing having esteemed, by which he was sanctified, and the spirit of the favor having insulted?

30. We know for the one saying: To me vengeance, I will repay, says Lord; and again: Lord will judge the people of himself.

31. A fearful thing the to fall into hands of God living.

32. Remember you but the former days, in which having been enlightened a great contest you endured of sufferings;

33. this indeed, by reproaches both and by afflictions being made a spectacle; this but, partners of those thus being overturned having become.

34. And for with the prisoners you sympathized, and the seize of the goods of you with joy you submitted to, knowing to have for yourselves better property in heavens and abiding.

35. Not do you cast away therefore the confidence of you, which has a reward great.

36. Of patience for you have need; so that the will of the God having done, you may receive the promise.

37. Yet for a little while very very, the the coming one will come and not will delay.

38. The but just one by faith shall live; and if he should draw back, not delights the soul of me in him.

39. We but not are for shrinking back, to destruction; but for faith, to a saving of life.

## Hebrews 11

1. Is but faith, of things being hoped for a basis, of things a conviction not being seen.

2. By this for were attested the ancients.

3. In faith we perceive to have been adjusted the ages by a word of God, in order that not out of things appearing the things being seen to have happened.

4. In faith more sacrifice Abel than Cain offered to the God, through which he was attested to be righteous, testifying on the gifts of him of the God; and through her having died yet speaks.

5. In faith Enoch was translated, of the not to see death; and not he was found, because translated him the God; before for the translation of him he had obtained testimony to have well pleased the God.

6. Without but faith impossible to have pleased; to believe for it is necessary the one coming near to the God, because he is, and to those seeking him a rewarder he becomes.

7. In faith being divinely Noah concerning the not yet things being seen, having been piously afraid built an ark for a preservation of the house of himself; through which he condemned the world, and of the according to faith righteousness became an heir.

8. In faith being called Abraham was obedient to go forth into the place, which he was about to receive for an inheritances, and he went forth, not knowing where he was going.

9. In faith he sojourned in the land of the promise as a stranger, in tents having dwelt, with Isaac and Jacob of the jointheirs of the promise of the same;

10. was waiting for that the foundations having city, of which a designer and architect the God;

11. In faith also herself Sarah power for a laying down of seed received, even beyond a proper time of life, since faithful she regarded the one promising.

12. Therefore even from one were born, and these things having been dead, like the stars of the heaven for the multitude, and like the sand that by the shore of the sea the innumerable,

13. In faith died these all, not having received the promises, but far distant them having seen and having saluted, and having confessed, that strangers and sojourners they are on the earth.

14. Those for such things saying make known that a country they seek.

15. And if indeed that they remembered from which they came forth, they would have had a season to have returned;

16. now but a better they long after, this is, heavenly. Therefore not is ashamed of them the God, a God to be called of them; he prepared for for them a city.

17. In faith offered up Abraham the Isaac being tried, and the onlybegotten was offering up he the promise having received,

18. to whom it was said: That in Isaac shall be called to thee a seed;

19. inferring, that even out of dead ones to raise up is able the God; whence him also in a similitude he recovered.

20. In faith concerning things being to come blessed Isaac the Jacob and the Esau.

21. In faith Jacob dying each of the sons of Joseph blessed; and bowed down on the top of the staff of himself.

22. In faith Joseph ending concerning the going out of the sons of Israel reminded, and concerning the bones of himself gave charge.

23. In faith Moses being born was hidden three months by the parents of himself, because they saw beautiful the babe; and not they did fear the mandate of the king.

24. In faith Moses great having become refused to be called a son of a daughter of Pharaoh,

25. rather choosing to suffer evil with the people of the God, than for a season to have of sin enjoyment;

26. greater wealth having regarded of the Egypt treasures the reproach of the Anointed; he looked away for towards the reward.

27. In faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; the for unseen one as seeing he was strong.

28. In faith he has made the passover and the pouring on of the blood, so that not the one destroying the firstborns, might touch of them.

29. In faith they passed through the red sea as through a dry place; which a trial attempting the Egyptians, were swallowed up.

30. In faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encompassed for seven days.

31. In faith Rahab the harlot not was destroyed with those unbelieving, having received the spies with peace.

32. And what further may I say? Will fail for me relating the time concerning Gideon, Barak also and Samson, and Jepthah, David also and Samuel, and the prophets;

33. who by means of faith subdued kingdoms, performed righteousness, obtained promises, closed up, mouths of lions,

34. quenched power of fire, escaped mouths of sword, were made strong from weakness, became mighty ones in war, camps overturned of foreigners;

35. received women from a resurrection the dead ones of themselves; others but were beaten to death, not having accepted the redemption, so that a better resurrection they might obtain.

36. Others but of mockings and of scourges a trial received, further but of bonds and of imprisonment;

37. they were stoned, they were sawn a sunder, they were tempted, by slaughter of sword they died; they went about in sheepskins, in goat skins, being in want, being afflicted, being illtreated,

38. (of whom not was worthy the world,) in deserts wandering and in mountains, and in caves and in the holes of the earth.

39. And these all having been attested by means of the faith, not did obtain the promise,

40. the God concerning us a better thing having foreseen, so that not apart from us they might be made perfect.

## Hebrews 12

1. Therefore also we, such having surrounding us a cloud of witnesses, encumbrance having laid aside every, and the closegirding sin, by means of patient endurance we should run the being laid out for us course;

2. looking away to the of the faith leader and perfecter Jesus, who in return for the being placed before him joy, endured a cross, shame disregarding, at right and of the throne of the God has sat down.

3. Attentively consider you for the such one having endured from the sinners towards himself opposition, no that not you may be wearied in the souls of you being discouraged.

4. Not yet even to blood you resisted with the sin contending against;

5. and you have forgotten the exhortation, which with you as with sons reasons: O son of me, not do not slight discipline of Lord, neither be thou discouraged by him being reproved;

6. whom for loves Lord, he disciplines; he scourges and every son whom he receives.

7. If discipline you endure, as with sons with you deals the God; any for is son, whom not disciplines a father?

8. If but without you are discipline, of which partakes have become all, certainly bastards you are and not sons.

9. Then those indeed of the flesh of us fathers we have disciplinarians, and we reverenced; not by much more shall we be submissive to the Father of the spirits, and we shall live?

10. They indeed for for a few days, according to that seeming right to them, disciplined; he but for that being profitable, in order that to partake of the holiness of him.

11. All but discipline as to indeed that being present not seems of joy to be but of grief; afterwards but fruit peaceful to those through her having been trained it returns of righteousness.

12. Therefore the having been wearied hands and the having been enfeebled knees do you brace up;

13. and paths level do you make for the feet of you, so that not the lame may be turned out, may be healed but rather.

14. Peace do you pursue with all, and the holiness, which without no one shall see the Lord.

15. Looking carefully, lest any one falling back from the favor of the God; lest any root of bitterness upward springing may disturb, and by means of this may be polluted many;

16. lest any fornicator, or profane person like Esau, who on account of eating of one sold the birthrights of himself.

17. You know for, that even afterwards wishing to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for a change of mind for a place not he found, through with tears having earnestly sought her.

18. Not for you have approached being touched a mountain, and having been hurt with fire, and to a thick cloud, and to darkness, and to tempest,

19. and of a trumpet to a sound, and to a voice of words of which those having heard entreated, not to be added to them a word;

20. (not they endured for that being enjoined. If even a wildbeast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;

21. and, so fearful was that being seen, Moses said: Affrighted I am and tremble;)

22. but you have approached Zion a mountain; and to a city of God living, Jerusalem heavenly; and to myriads, of messengers an entire assembly;

23. and to a congregation of firstborns, having been enrolled in heavens; and to a judge God of all; and to spirits of just ones having been perfected;

24. and of a covenant new to a mediator, Jesus; and of blood of sprinkling, a better thing speaking than the Abel.

25. Beware you, not you should refuse the one speaking. If for those not escaped, him on earth having refused divinely admonishing, by now much more we who him from heavens are turning away from;

26. of whom the voice the earth shook then; now but it has been announced, saying: Yet once for all I shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.

27. The but, yet once for all denotes of the things being shaken the removal, as of things having been made, so that may remain the not things being shaken.

28. Therefore kingdom unshaken receiving, may we hold fast favor, by means of which we may serve acceptably to the God, with reverence and piety.

29. Even for the God of us a fire consuming.

## Hebrews 13

1. The brotherly love let continue.

2. Of the kindto strangers not be you neglectful; through this for without knowing some having entertained messengers.

3. Be you mindful of the prisoners, as if having been bound together; of those being illtreated, as also yourselves being in body.

4. Honorable the marriage among all, and the bed undefiled; fornicators but and adulterers will judge the God.

5. Not a love of money the turn of mind; being satisfied with the things being present; he for has said: Not not thee may I leave, not even thee may I forsake;

6. so that being confident us to say: A Lord for me a helper, and not I will fear; what shall do to me a man?

7. Remember you of those leading of you, who spoke to you the word of the God; of whom viewing attentively the result of the mode of life, imitate you the faith.

8. Jesus Anointed yesterday and today the same, and for the ages.

9. By teachings various and strange not be you lead away; good for by favor to be established the heart, not by provisions, by which not were profited those having walked about.

10. We have an altar, from which to eat not they have authority those in the tabernacle serving.

11. Of whom for is brought animals the blood concerning sin into the holies by means of the highpriest, of these the bodies are burned outside of the camp.

12. Therefore also Jesus, so that he might sanctify through the own blood the people, outside of the gate suffered.

13. Now then let us go forth to him outside of the camp, the reproach for him bearing;

14. not for we have here abiding a city, but the one being about to come we seek.

15. Through him therefore may we offer a sacrifice of praise continually to the God, this is, fruit of lips ascribing praise to the name of him.

16. Of the but doing good and fellowship not be you neglectful; with such for sacrifices is wellpleased the God.

17. Be you obedient to those leading you, and he you subject; they for watch on behalf of the souls of you, as an account going to render; so that with joy this they may do, and not groanings; disastrous for to you this.

18. Pray you for us; we have confidence for, because a good conscience we have, in all things well wishing to conduct ourselves;

19. more earnestly but I entreat this to do, so that more quickly I may be restored of you.

20. The now God of the peace, the one having led up out of dead ones the shepherd of the sheep the great by blood of a covenant agelasting, the Lord of us Jesus,

21. knit together you in every work good, in order the to do the will of him; doing in you the wellpleasing thing in presence of himself, through Jesus Anointed; to whom the glory for the ages of the ages; so be it.

22. I entreat now you, brethren, bear you with the word of the exhortation; indeed for in few words I sent to you.

23. You know the brother Timothy having been sent away, with whom, if quickly he comes, I shall see you.

24. Salute you all the leaders of you, and all the holy ones. Salute you those from the Italy.

25. The favor with all of you. So be it.
