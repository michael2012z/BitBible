## Romans 1

1. Paul, a servant of Jesus Anointed, called an apostle, having been set apart for glad tidings of God,

2. (which he promised before through the prophets of himself in writings holy,)

3. concerning the son of himself, (that having been born from a seed of David according to flesh;

4. that having been distinctly set forth a son of God in power, according to spirit of holiness, from a resurrection of dead ones,) Jesus Anointed of the Lord of us,

5. (through whom we received favor and apostleship for obedience of faith in all the nations, in behalf of the name of him;

6. among whom are also you, called ones of Jesus Anointed;)

7. to all those who are in Rome beloved ones of God called saints; favor to you and peace from God Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed.

8. First indeed I give thanks to the God of me through Jesus Anointed on account of all of you, because the faith of you is celebrated in whole the world.

9. A witness for of me is the God, to whom I am a servant in the spirit of me in the glad tidings of the son of him, how unceasingly remembrance of you I make,

10. always on the prayers of me asking, if possibly now at length I shall have a prosperous journey by the will of the God to come to you.

11. I long for to see you, that some I may impart gift to you spiritual, for the to be established you;

12. this and is, to be comforted together, among you through the in each other faith, of you and also of me.

13. Not I wish but you to be ignorant, brethren, that many times I purposed to come to you, (and was hindered till the present,) that some fruit I might have also among you, as even among the other nations.

14. to Greeks both and to barbarians, to wise ones both and to simple ones a debtor I am;

15. thus, that according to me, I am eager even to you to those in Rome to announce glad tidings.

16. Not for I am ashamed the glad tidings; power for of God is for salvation to all to the believing, to Jew both first and to Greek.

17. Righteousness for of God in it is revealed from faith in order to faith, as it has been written: The and just by faith, shall live.

18. Is revealed besides wrath of God from heaven on all impiety and injustice of men, of those the truth by injustice holding down.

19. Because that known of the God manifest is among them; the God for to them showed,

20. (the things for unseen of him from creation of the world, in the things made being perceived is clearly seen, the both eternal of him power and deity;) in order that to be them inexcusable.

21. Because having known the God, not as God they glorified or they gave thanks; but were vain in the reasonings of them, and was darkened the perverse of them heart;

22. asserting to be wise ones, they were foolish,

23. and changed the glory of the incorruptible God in a likeness of an image of corruptible man, and birds and of fourfooted beasts and creeping things.

24. There fore also delivered them the God in the lusts of the hearts of them to impurity, of the to be dishonored the bodies of them in themselves;

25. who exchanged the truth of the God in the falsehood and reverenced and served the created thing more than him having created, who is worthy of praise into the ages; so be it.

26. On account of this delivered them the God to passions of infamy. The even for females of them changed the natural use into that in violation of nature.

27. In like manner and also the males having left the natural use of the female, were inflamed with the lust of them for for each other, males with males the indecency working out, and the recompence, which it was proper, of the error of them in themselves receiving back.

28. And as not they did try the God to have in knowledge, delivered them the God to a worthless mind, to do the things not fitting;

29. having been filled with all iniquity, in wickedness, in covetousness, in malignity; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, bad disposition, whisperers;

30. revilers, Godhaters, insolent ones, proud ones, boasters, inventors of evils, to parent disobedient,

31. obstinate ones, covenantbreakers, unaffectionate ones, implacable ones, unmerciful ones;

32. who the ordinance of the God having known, (that those the things such doing worthy of death are,) not only them they do; but even are well pleased to those doing.

## Romans 2

1. Wherefore inexcusable thou art, O man every one who art judging. In which for thou judgest the other, thyself thou condemnest; the things for same thou doest who art judging.

2. We know but, that the sentence of the God is according to truth upon those the things such doing.

3. Thinkest thou and this, O man who art judging those the things such doing, and art doing them, that thou shalt escape the sentence of the God?

4. Or of the wealth of the goodness of him and of the forbearance and of the patience thinkest thou wrong, being ignorant, that the goodness of the God to reformation thee leads?

5. According to but the hardness of thee and unchanged heart, thou treasurest to thyself wrath in a day of wrath and of a revelation of righteous judgment of the God,

6. who will render to each according to the works of him;

7. to those indeed by perseverance of a work good, glory and honor and incorruptibility are seeking, life agelasting;

8. to those but from a party spirit, and disobeying indeed the truth, obeying but the unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.

9. Affliction and distress on every soul of man of the working the evil, of Jew both first and of Greek;

10. glory but and honor and peace to every one the working the good, to Jew both first and to Greek.

11. Not for is respect of persons with the God.

12. As many as for without law sinned, without law also shall perish; and as many as under law sinned, by law shall be judged,

13. (not for the hearers of the law just ones with the God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

14. When for Gentiles those not a law having, by nature the things of the law may do, these a law not having, to themselves are a law;

15. who show plainly the work of the law written in the hearts of them, testifying with them the conscience, and between each other of the reasonings accusing or even defending,)

16. in a day when shall judge the God the things secrets of the men, according to the glad tidings of me, through Jesus Anointed.

17. If but thou a Jew art named, and doest rest in the law, and doest boast in God,

18. and knowest the will, and discernest the things differing, being instructed out of the law;

19. hast believed and thyself a guide to be of blind ones, a light of those in darkness,

20. an instructor of simple ones, a teacher of babes, having the form of the knowledge and of the truth in the law;

21. who then art teaching another, thyself not doest thou teach; who art preaching not to steal, doest thou steal?

22. who art saying not to commit adultery, doest thou commit adultery? who art detesting the idols, doest thou rob temples?

23. who in a law boastest, through the violation of the law the God doest thou dishonor?

24. The for name of the God through you is blasphemed among the nations, even as it has been written.

25. Circumcision indeed for profits, if law thou practisest; if but a violator of law thou mayest be, the circumcision of thee uncircumcision has become.

26. If therefore the uncircumcision the ordinances of the law may keep, not the uncircumcision of him for circumcision will be counted?

27. and will judge the from nature uncircumcision, the law perfecting, thee who through letter and circumcision a violator of law?

28. Not for he in the outward appearance, a Jew is, nor that in the outward appearance, in flesh, circumcision;

29. but he in the hidden a Jew, even circumcision of heart, in spirit, not letter; of whom the praise not from men, but from the God.

## Romans 3

1. What then the preeminence of the Jew? or what the profit of the circumcision?

2. Much, according to every mode. First indeed for, because they were entreated with the oracles of the God.

3. What for? if believed not some, not the unbelief of them the faith of the God will make void?

4. Not let it be; let it be but the God true, every but man a liar, even as it has been written: That thou mayest be justified in the words of thee, and mayest conquer in the to be judged thee.

5. If but the unrighteousness of us of God righteousness establishes, what shall we say? not unrighteous the God that inflicting wrath? (according to man I speak.)

6. Not let it be; otherwise how will judge the God the world?

7. If for the truth of the God by the my falsehood abounded to the glory of him, why yet also I as a sinner am judged?

8. And not (as we are falsely accused, and as affirm some of us to say,) that we may do the evil things, so that may come the good things? of whom the judgment just is.

9. What then? do we excel? Not at all; we before convicted for, Jews both and Greeks all under sin to be?

10. even as it has been written: That not is just not even one;

11. not is he understanding, not is he seeking out the God;

12. all turned aside, together they were unprofitable; not is doing goodness, not is even one.

13. A sepulchre having been opened the throat of them; with the tongues of them they deceived. Venom of asps under the lips of them;

14. Of whom the mouth of cursing and bitterness is full.

15. Swift the feet of them to pour out blood;

16. ruin and misery in the ways of them;

17. and a way of peace not they knew.

18. Not is fear of God before the eyes of them.

19. We know and, that what things the law says, to those under the law it speaks; that every mouth may be stopped, and liable to penalty may become all the world to the God.

20. Therefore from works of law not shall be justified all flesh before him; through for law an acknowledgment of sin.

21. Now but without law a righteousness of God has been made manifest, being attested by the law and the prophets,

22. a righteousness even of God through faith of Jesus Anointed, to all and upon all the believing; not for is a distinction.

23. All for sinned, and come short of the glory of the God,

24. being justified freely, by the of him favor, through the redemption that in Anointed Jesus;

25. whom set forth the God a mercyseat through the faith by the of him blood, for a pointing out of the righteousness of himself, through the passing by of the formerly committed sins in the forbearance of the God;

26. to a point out of the righteousness of himself in the present time, in order that to be him righteous, and justifying him of faith of Jesus.

27. Where then the boasting? it is shut out. Through what kind of law? of the works? no, but through a law of faith;

28. we reckon for, to be justified by faith a man, without works of law.

29. Or of Jews the God alone? not and of Gentiles? yes also of Gentiles.

30. Since one the God, who will justify circumcision from faith, and uncircumcision through the faith.

31. Law then do we nullify through the faith? Not let it be; but law we establish.

## Romans 4

1. What then shall we say Abraham the father of us to have found according to flesh?

2. If for Abraham from works was justified, he has boasting, but not towards the God.

3. What for the writings says? Believed and Abraham the God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.

4. To him but working the reward not is counted according to favor, but according to debt;

5. to him but not working, believing but on the one justifying the ungodly, is counted the faith of himself for righteousness;

6. even as and David speaks the blessedness of the man, to whom the God counts righteousness without works;

7. blessed ones, of whom are forgiven the iniquities, and of whom are covered over the sins;

8. blessed man, to whom not not may count Lord sin.

9. The blessedness then this, on the circumcision or also on the uncircumcision? We say for, that was counted to the Abraham the faith for righteousness.

10. How then was it counted? in circumcision being, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;

11. and a sign he received of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith of that in the uncircumcision; in order that to be him a father of all of those believing through uncircumcision, (in order that to be counted also to them the righteousness,)

12. and a father of circumcision, to those not from circumcision alone, but also to those treading in the footsteps of the in uncircumcision faith of the father of us Abraham.

13. Not for through law the promise to the Abraham, or the seed of him, that a possessor him to be of a world, but through a righteousness of faith.

14. If for those of law, possessors, has been made void the faith, and has been multiplied the promise;

15. the for law wrath works out; where for not is law, neither transgression.

16. On account of this from faith, so that according to favor; in order that to be sure the promise to all the seed, not to that from the law alone, but also to that from faith Abraham who is a father of all of us;

17. even as it has been written: That a father of many nations I have placed thee;) in presence of whom he believed of God, of that making alive the dead ones, and calling the things not being as being.

18. Who contrary to hope in hope believed, in order that to have become him a father of many nations, (according to that having been spoken: Thus shall be the seed of thee;)

19. and not having grown weak in the faith, not he regarded the of himself body already having been deadened, an hundred years old thereabouts being, and the deadness of the womb of Sarah;

20. against and the promise of the God not he disputed in the unbelief, but was made strong in the faith, giving glory to the God,

21. and having been fully assured, that what has been promised, able he is also to do.

22. Wherefore also it was counted to him for righteousness.

23. Not it was written but on account of him alone, that it was counted to him;

24. but also on account of us, to whom it is about to be counted, to those believing on the one having raised up Jesus the Lord of us out of dead ones;

25. who was delivered up on account of the offences of us, and was raised up on account of the justification of us.

## Romans 5

1. Having been justified therefore by faith, peace we have with the God through the Lord of us Jesus Anointed;

2. through whom also the introduction we have (by the faith) into the favor this, in which we have stood; and we boast in hope of the glory of the God.

3. Not alone and, but also we boast in the afflictions, knowing that the affliction endurance works out,

4. the and endurance approbation, the and approbation hope,

5. the and hope not is put to shame, because the love of the God has been poured out in the hearts of us through spirit holy of that having been given to us.

6. Yet for an Anointed one, being of us without strength still, according to a season in behalf of impious ones he died.

7. Scarcely for in behalf of a just person any one will die; in behalf of though the good possibly some one even might dare to die;

8. recommends but the of himself love to us the God, because, still sinners being of us, Anointed one in behalf of us died.

9. By much then more, having been justified now in the blood of him, we shall be saved through him from the wrath.

10. If for enemies being we were reconciled to the God through the death of the son of him, by much more having been reconciled we shall be saved in the life of him.

11. Not only and, but also boasting in the God through the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, through whom now the reconciliation we received.

12. On account of this as through one man the sin into the world entered, and through the sin the death; and thus to all men the death passed through, in which all sinned.

13. Till for law sin was in world; sin but not is counted not being law.

14. But reigned the death from Adam till Moses and over those not having sinned in the likeness of the transgression of Adam; who is a type of the one being about to come.

15. But not as the fall, so also the gracious gift. If for by the of one one fall the many died, by much the favor of the God and the gift by favor by that of the one man Jesus Anointed to the many abounded.

16. And not as through one having sinned, the free gift. The indeed for sentence, from one to condemnation; the but gracious gift, from many offences to righteousness.

17. If for by the of the one fail the death reigned through the one, by much more those the abundance of the favor and of the gift of the righteousness having received, in life shall reign through one Jesus Anointed.

18. Indeed then as through one offence, on all men to condemnation; so also through one righteousness, on all men to a justification of life.

19. As for through the disobedience of the one man sinners were constituted the many; so also through the obedience of the one righteous person shall be constituted the many.

20. Law but supervened, so that might abound the offence; where but abounded the sin, superabounded the favor;

21. that as reigned the sin in the death, so and the favor might reign through righteousness into life agelasting, through Jesus Anointed the Lord of us.

## Romans 6

1. What then shall we say? ought we to continue in the sin, so that the favor may abound?

2. Not let it be. Who we died by the sin, how still shall we live in it?

3. Or are you ignorant, that as many as were dipped into Anointed Jesus, into the death of him were dipped?

4. We were buried together therefore with him through the dipping into the death, that as was raised up Anointed out of dead ones through the glory of the Father, so also we in newness of life should walk.

5. If for planted together we have become in the likeness of the death of him, certainly also of the resurrection we shall be;

6. this knowing, that the old of us man was crucified with, that might be rendered powerless the body of the sin, of the no longer to be enslaved us in the sin;

7. he for having died has been justified from the sin.

8. If but we died with Anointed, we believe, that also we shall live with him,

9. knowing, that Anointed having been raised out of dead ones, no longer dies; death of him no longer lords over.

10. Which for he died, by the sin he died once for all; which but he lives, he lives by the God.

11. So also you count yourselves dead ones indeed by the sin, living ones but by the God, in Anointed Jesus.

12. Not therefore let reign the sin, in the mortal of you body, in order that to obey;

13. nor present you the members of you weapons of unrighteousness to the sin; but present you yourselves to the God, as out of dead ones living, and the members of you weapons of righteousness to the God.

14. Sin for to you not shall lord over; not for you are under law, but under favor.

15. What then? shall we sin, because not we are under law, but under favor? Not let it be.

16. Not you know, that to whom you present yourselves slaves for obedience, slaves you are to whom you are obedient, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?

17. Thanks but to the God, that you were slaves of the sin, you obeyed yet from heart into which you were delivered a form of teaching.

18. Having been freed and from the sin, you were enslaved to the righteousness.

19. (According to man I speak, on account of the weakness of the flesh of you.) As for you presented the members of you slaves to the uncleanness and to the iniquity for the iniquity; so now present you in members of you slaves to the righteousness for sanctification.

20. When for slaves you were of the sin, free you were to the righteousness.

21. What therefore fruit had you then? in the things now you are ashamed; the for end of those, death.

22. Now but having been freed from the sin, having been enslaved and to the God, you have the fruit of you in sanctification; the and end, life agelasting.

23. The for wages of the sin, death; the but gracious gift of the God, life agelasting in an Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.

## Romans 7

1. Or are you ignorant, brethren, (to those knowing for law I speak,) that the law lords over the man, for as long as a time he lives?

2. The for bound to a man woman to the living husband is bound by law; if but may die the husband, she is freed from the law of the husband.

3. So then living the husband an adulteress she will be called, if she should be to a man another; if but should die the husband, free she is from law, of the not to be her an adulteress, having become to a man another.

4. Therefore brethren of me, also you were put to death by the law through the body of the Anointed, in order that to become you to another, to him out of dead ones having been raised, so that we should bring forth fruit to the God.

5. When for we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins, those through the law, worked in the members of us, in order that to bring forth fruit to the death.

6. Now but we were freed from the law, having died, in which we were held; so that to serve us in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.

7. What then shall we say? the law sin? Not let it be; but the sin not I knew, if not through law; the even for strong desire not I knew, if not the law said: Not thou shalt lust.

8. Opportunity and having taken the sin, through the commandment worked out in me all strong desire; apart from for law sin dead.

9. I and was alive apart from law then; having come but the commandment, the sin lived again, I and died;

10. and was found by me the commandment that for life, same for death.

11. The for sin opportunity having taken, through the commandment deceived me, and through it killed.

12. So that the indeed law holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.

13. That then good thing, to me has become death? Not let it be; but the sin; so that it might appear sin, through the good to me working out death, so that might become in excess a sinner the sin through the commandment.

14. We know for, that the law spiritual is; I but fleshly am, having been sold under the sin.

15. What for I work out, not I know; not for what I wish, this I practice; but what I hate, this I do.

16. If but what not I wish, this I do, I assent to the law, that excellent.

17. Now but no longer I work out it, but the dwelling in me sin.

18. I know for, that not dwells in me, this is in the flesh of me, a good thing; the for to will is present with me, the but to work out the excellent, not I find.

19. Not for what I wish, I do a good thing; but what not I wish an evil thing, this I practice.

20. If but what not wish I, this I do, no longer I work out it, but the dwelling in me sin.

21. I find therefore the law in the wishing to me to do the excellent, because with me the evil thing lies near.

22. I am pleased for wish the law of the God according to the inside man;

23. I see but another law in the members of me warring against the law of the mind of me, and making a captive me to the law of the sin to that existing in the members of me.

24. Wretched I man; who me will rescue from the body of the death this?

25. I thank the God by means of Jesus Anointed of the Lord of me. So then myself I with the indeed mind am in servitude to a law of God; with the but flesh, to a law of sin.

## Romans 8

1. No therefore now condemnation to those in an Anointed Jesus.

2. The for law of the spirit of the life by an Anointed Jesus freed me from the law of the sin and of the death.

3. The for inability of the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, the God the of himself son having sent in a form of flesh of sin, and on account of sin, condemned the sin in the flesh;

4. so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled by us, by those not according to flesh walking, but according to spirit.

5. Those for according to flesh being, the things of the flesh are minding; those but according to spirit, the things of the spirit.

6. The for mind of the flesh, death; the but mind of the spirit, life, and peace.

7. Because the mind of the flesh, enmity to God; to the for law of the God not it is subject, neither for it is able;

8. those and in flesh being, to God to be pleasing not they are able.

9. You but not are in flesh, but in spirit, if indeed spirit of God dwells in you. If and any one spirit of an Anointed one not has, he not is of him.

10. If but an Anointed in you, the indeed body dead with respect to sin; the but spirit life with respect to righteousness.

11. If but the spirit of him having raised up Jesus out of the dead ones dwells in you, he having raised the Anointed out of dead ones, will make alive also the mortal bodies of you, through the indwelling of him spirit in you.

12. So then, brethren, debtors we are not to the flesh, of the according to flesh to live.

13. If for according to flesh you live, you are about to die; if but by spirit the practices of the body you put to death, you shall live.

14. As many as for by spirit of God are led, these are sons of God.

15. Not for you received a spirit of bondage back to fear, but you received a spirit of sonship, by which we cry: Abba, the Father.

16. Itself the spirit testifies together with the spirit of us, that we are children of God.

17. If and children, also heirs; heirs indeed of God, jointheirs and of an Anointed; if indeed we suffer with, so that also we may be glorified with.

18. I reckon for, that not comparable the sufferings of the now season with the being about glory to be revealed in us.

19. The for earnest desire of the creation the revelation of the sons of the God looks for.

20. To the for vanity the creation was placed under, (not voluntarily but through him having placed under,) in hope,

21. that even itself the creation will be freed from the bondage of the corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of the God.

22. We know for, that all the creation groan together and travails together till the now;

23. not only and, but also ourselves the firstfruit of the spirit having, and we ourselves in ourselves groan, a sonship looking for, the redemption of the body of us.

24. By the for hope we were saved. A hope but being seen, not is a hope; what for sees one, why also hopes?

25. If but what not we see, we hope, with patience we wait.

26. In like manner and also the spirit helps the weaknesses of us; the for what we should pray as it behooves, not we know, but itself the spirit intercedes on behalf of us with groans unspoken.

27. He but searching the hearts, knows what the mind of the spirit, because according to God it intercedes on behalf of holy ones.

28. We know and, that to those who love the God all things work together for good, to those according to a purpose called being.

29. Because whom he foreknew, also he before marked out copies of the likeness of the son of himself for the to be him a firstborn among many brethren.

30. Whom and he before marked out, those also he called; and whom he called, those also he justified whom and he justified, those also he glorified.

31. When then shall we say to these things? If the God on behalf of us, who against us?

32. Who indeed of the own son not spared, but on behalf of us all delivered up him; how not also with him the things all to us will he graciously give?

33. Who will bring a charge against chosen ones of God? God that justifying.

34. Who he condemning? Anointed that having died, still more and also having been raised, who also is on right of the God, who and intercedes on behalf of us.

35. Who us will separate from the love of the Anointed? Affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

36. (as it has been written: That on a account of thee we are put to death whole the day; we were accounted as sheep of slaughter.)

37. But in these all we more than conquer through the one having loved us.

38. I am persuaded for, that neither death nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor things being present, nor things being about to come, nor powers,

39. nor height, nor depth, nor any creation other will be able us to separate from the love of the God, of that in Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.

## Romans 9

1. Truth I speak, in Anointed; not I utter falsehood, (bearing testimony together to me the conscience of me,) in a spirit holy;

2. that grief to me it is great, and unceasing anguish in the heart of me.

3. Was wishing for myself I an accursed thing to be from the Anointed one on behalf of the brethren of me, of the relatives of me according to flesh;

4. who are Israelites, of whom the sonship, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the religious service, and the promises,

5. of whom the fathers, and from whom the Anointed that according to flesh, he being over all God worthy of praise into the ages. So be it.

6. Not so as but, that has fallen off the word of the God; not for all those from Israel, these Israel.

7. Nor because they are seed of Abraham, all children, but in Isaac shall be called to thee a seed,

8. this is, not the children of the flesh, these children of the God; but the children of the promise are counted for seed.

9. Of promise for the word this: According to the season this I will come, and shall be to the Sarah a son.

10. Not only and, but also Rebecca, from one conception having Isaac the father of us.

11. Not yet for they having been born, nor having done anything good or bad, (so that the according to an election purpose of the God might abide, not from works, but from the one calling.)

12. it was said to her: That the greater shall be subject to the lesser;

13. as it has been written: The Jacob I loved, the but Esau I hated.

14. What then shall we say? not injustice with the God? Not let it be.

15. To the for Moses he says: I will pity whom I pity, and compassionate whom I should compassionate.

16. So then not of the one willing, nor of the one running, but of the pitying God.

17. Says for the writing to the Pharaoh: That for same this I raised up thee, that I might show in thee the power of me, and that may be declared the name of me in all the earth.

18. So then whom he wills, he pities; whom and he wills, he hardens.

19. Thou wilt say then to me: Why still does he find fault? to the for will of him who has been opposed?

20. But indeed, O man, thou who art, the one answering again to the God? Not shall say the thing formed to the one having formed: Why me madest thou thus?

21. Or not has authority the potter of the clay, out of the same mixture to make, this indeed for honor a vessel, that and for dishonor?

22. If but wishing the God to show the wrath, and make known the power of himself, bore in much longsuffering vessels of wrath having been fitted for destruction;

23. and that he might make known the wealth of the glory of himself on vessels of mercy, which were previously prepared for glory;

24. whom even he called us, not only from Jews, but also from Gentiles.

25. As also in the Hosea he says: I will call that not a people of me, a people of me; and her not beloved, beloved.

26. And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them: Not a people of me you, there they shall be called sons of God living.

27. Esaias but cries on behalf of the Israel: If should be the number of the sons of Israel as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.

28. An account for he is finishing and cutting short in righteousness because an account having been cut short will make a Lord on the earth.

29. And as before said Esaias: If not Lord of hosts left to us a seed, as Sodom we should have become, and as Gomorrah we should have been made like.

30. What then shall we say? That Gentiles those not pursuing righteousness, laid hold on righteousness, a righteousness even that from faith;

31. Israel but pursuing a law of righteousness, to a law of righteousness not attained.

32. Why? Because not from faith, but as it were from works of law. They struck against for the stone of the stumbling;

33. even as it has been written: Lo, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; and every one the relying on it, not shall be disappointed.

## Romans 10

1. Brethren, the indeed goodwill of the my heart, and the prayer that to the God, on behalf of them for salvation.

2. I testify for to them, that a zeal for God they have, but not according to knowledge.

3. Being ignorant for the of the God righteousness, and the own seeking to establish, to the righteousness of the God not they were brought under.

4. An end for a law Anointed, for righteousness to every one to the believing.

5. Moses for writes the righteousness that from the law: That the having done those things man, shall live in them.

6. The but from faith righteousness thus speaks: Not thou myself say in the heart of thee: Who shall ascend into the heaven? this is, an Anointed to lead down.

7. Or, who shall go down into the abyss? this is, an Anointed out of dead ones to lead back.

8. But what says it? Near thee the word is, in the mouth of thee, and in the heart of thee; this is, the word of the faith which we publish;

9. that if thou wilt confess with the mouth of thee Lord Jesus, and thou wilt believe in the heart of thee, that the God him raised out of dead ones, thou shalt be saved.

10. (In heart for it is believed for righteousness; with mouth and it is confessed for salvation.)

11. Says for the writing: Every one the believing on him, not shall be ashamed.

12. Not for is a distinction of Jew both and of Greek; the for same Lord of all, being rich towards all those calling upon him.

13. Every one for who may call on the name of Lord, shall be saved.

14. How then shall they call on, into whom not they believed? how and shall they believe, where not they heard? how and shall they hear without one proclaiming?

15. How and shall the proclaim, if not they should be sent; as it has been written: How beautiful the feet of those announcing glad tidings of peace, of those announcing glad tidings the things good.

16. But not all obeyed the glad tidings. Esaias for says: O Lord, who believed the hearing of us?

17. (Then the faith from hearing; the and hearing through a word of God.)

18. But I say: Not not they heard? Yes indeed into all the earth went out the sound of them, and into the ends of the inhabited earth the words of them.

19. But I say: Not Israel now knew? First Moses says: I will provoke to jealousy you by not a nation, by a nation unenlightened I will provoke to anger you.

20. Esaias but is very bold, and says: I was found by those me not seeking, manifest I became to those me not asking.

21. In respect to but the Israel he says: Whole the day I stretched out the hands of me to a people disobeying and contradicting.

## Romans 11

1. I say then: Not did put away the God the people of himself? Not let it be; and for I an Israelite I am, of seed of Abraham, of tribe of Benjamin.

2. Not did put away the God the people of himself, whom he before knew. Or not know you, in Elijah what says the writing? as he complains to the God against the Israel:

3. O Lord, the prophets of thee they killed, and the altars of thee they drug down; and I was left alone, and they are seeking the life of me.

4. But what says to him the dive oracle? I left to myself seven thousand men, who not bent a knee to the Baal.

5. Thus then even in the present season a remnant according to an election of favor, has been made.

6. If but by favor no longer from works; otherwise the favor no longer is favor.

7. What then? What seeks Israel, this not he obtained, the but chosen obtained; the and remaining ones were hardened,

8. (as it has been written: Gave to them the God a spirit of deep sleep, eyes of the not to see, and ears of the not to hear,) till the today day.

9. And David says: Let be made the table of them into a snare, and into a trap and into a stumbling block, and into a recompence to them;

10. let be darkened the eyes of them, of the not to see; and the back of them always bow down.

11. I say then: Not did they stumble, so that they might fall? Not let it be; but by the of them fall the salvation to the nations, in order that to excite to emulation them.

12. If but the fall of them wealth of a world, and the failure of them wealth of nations; how much more the full acceptance of them?

13. To you for I speak the Gentiles; in so much indeed am I of Gentiles an apostle, the service of me I shall glorify,

14. if possibly I may excite to emulation of me the flesh, and I may save some from of them.

15. If for the casting off of them a reconciliation of a world; what the receiving, if not life out of dead ones?

16. If and the firstfruit holy, also the mixture; and if the root holy, also the branches.

17. If but some of the branches were broken off, thou and a wild olive being wast ingrafted instead of them, and a partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive thou didst become,

18. not do thou boast of the branches; if but thou doest boast, not thou the root sustainest but the root thee.

19. Thou wilt say then: Were broken off branches, so that I might be grafted in.

20. True; by the unbelief they were broken off, thou and by the faith hast been standing; not behighminded, but fear.

21. If for the God those according to nature branches not spared, perhaps not even thee will he spare.

22. See then kindness and severity of God; towards indeed those having fallen, severity; towards but thee, kindness, if thou shouldst remain in the kindness; otherwise even thou shalt be cut off.

23. Also they but, if not they should remain in the unbelief, shall be ingrafted; able for is the God again to graft them.

24. If for thou out of the according to nature wast cut off wild olive, and in violation of nature thou wast ingrafted into a good olive, by how much more these who according to nature, shall be ingrafted in the own olive.

25. Not for I wish you to be ignorant, brethren, the secret this, (that not you may be with yourselves wise, that hardness from a part to the Israel has happened, till the fulness of the Gentiles may come in;

26. and then all Israel shall be saved, as it has been written: Shall come out of Zion the deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.

27. And this with them the from me covenant, when I may take away the sins of them.

28. According to indeed the glad tidings, enemies on account of you; according to but the election, beloved on account of the fathers.

29. Things not to be repented of for the gracious gifts and the calling of the God.

30. As for you once disobeyed the God, now but obtained mercy by the of these disobedience;

31. thus also these now disobeyed, in the your mercy that also they may obtain mercy.

32. Shut up for the God the all for disobedience, so that the all he might compassionate.

33. O depth of wealth and of wisdom and of knowledge of God. How unsearchable the judgments of him, and untraceable the ways of him.

34. Who for knew mind of Lord? or who a counsellor of him became?

35. or who first gave to him, and it shall be given in return to him?

36. Because out of him, and through him, and for him the things all; to him the glory for the ages. So be it.

## Romans 12

1. I entreat therefore you, brethren, through the tender compassion of the God, to present the bodies of you a sacrifice living, holy, wellpleasing to the God, the rational religious service of you;

2. and not conform yourselves to take age this, but transform yourselves by the renovation of the mind of you, in order that to prove you, what the will of the God, the good and wellpleasing and perfect.

3. I say for through the favor of that having been given to me, to all to him being among you, not to think above beyond what it behooves to think, but to think in order that to be of sound mind, to each one as the God divided a measure of faith.

4. Just as for in one body members many we have, the but members all not the same has operation;

5. thus the many one body we are in Anointed, the but each one, of each other members.

6. Having but gracious gifts according to the favor the having been given to us of different kinds; if prophets, according to the analogy of the faith.

7. If service, in the service; if the teaching, in the act of teaching;

8. if the exhorting, in the exhortation; the one giving, with simplicity; the one presiding, with diligence; the one pitying, with cheerfulness.

9. The love, unfeigned detesting the evil, adhering to the good;

10. in the brotherly kindness, towards each other tender affection; in the honor each other going before;

11. in the study not idle ones; in the spirit being fervent; to the Lord serving;

12. in the hope rejoicing; in the affliction being patient; in the prayer constantly attending;

13. to the wants of the holy ones contributing; the kindness to strangers following.

14. Bless you those persecuting you; bless you, and not curse you.

15. To rejoice with rejoicing ones, and to weep with weeping ones.

16. The same for each other minding; not the things high minding, but to the low ones conform yourselves. Not become wise with yourselves.

17. To no one evil in return for evil giving back; providing honorable things in presence of all men;

18. if able that from of you, with all men being at peace;

19. not yourself avenging, beloved ones; but give you a place to the wrath; it has been written for: To me vengeance; I will repay, says Lord.

20. If therefore may hunger the enemy of thee, do thou feed him; if he may thirst give drink to him. This for doing, coals of fire thou wilt pile on the head of him.

21. Not be overcome by the evil, but overcome by the good the evil.

## Romans 13

1. Every soul to authorities being above let be submissive. Not for is authority if not from God; those and being, under God having been arranged are.

2. So the one setting himself in opposition to the authority, to the of the God institution has been opposed; they but having been set in opposition, to themselves judgment will receive.

3. The for rulers not are a terror of the good works, but of the evil ones. Wishest thou and not to fear the authority? the good do thou; and thou wilt have praise from her;

4. of God for a servant he is to thee for the good. If but the evil thou shouldst do, fear thou; not for in vain the sword he bears; of God for a servant he is, an avenger for wrath to him the evil practising.

5. Wherefore necessity to be submissive, not only on account of the wrath, but also on account of the conscience.

6. On account of this for also taxes pay you; public ministers for of God they are, to same this constantly attending.

7. Render therefore to all the dues; to him the tax, the tax; to him the custom, the custom; to him the fear, the fear; to him the honor, the honor.

8. To no one nothing owe you, if not that each other you should love; the for loving the other, a law has fulfilled.

9. That for: Not thou shalt commit adultery. Not thou shalt commit murder. Not thou shalt steal. Not thou shalt covet; and if any other commandment, in this the word it is brought under one head, in this: Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee as thyself.

10. The love to the neighbor evil not works; a fulfilling then of law the love.

11. And this, knowing the season, that an hour us already out of sleep to be aroused; (now for nearer of us the salvation, than when we believed;

12. the night is far advanced, the and day has approached;) we should put off therefore the works of the darkness, and should put on the weapons of the light.

13. As in day, decently we should walk, not in revelings and in drinkings, not in whoredoms and in debaucheries, not in strife and envyings;

14. but put you on the Lord Jesus Anointed, and of the flesh provision not make you for lusts.

## Romans 14

1. The but weak to the faith, take to yourselves, not for differences of reasoning.

2. Who indeed believes to eat all things; the but one being weak herbs eats.

3. The one eating, the not one eating not despise; and the not eating, the one eating not judge; the God for him received to himself.

4. Thou who art the judging belonging to another household servant? to the own Lord he stands or he falls; he shall be made to stand and; able for is the God to make stand.

5. Indeed esteems a day from a day, another but esteems every day; each in the own mind let be fully assured.

6. He minding the day, to Lord minds; and he not minding the day, to Lord not minds. And he eating, to Lord eats, he gives thanks for to the God; and he not eating, to Lord not eats, and he gives thanks to the God.

7. No one for of you to himself lives, and no one to himself dies.

8. If both for we live, to the Lord we live; if and we die, to the Lord we die. If both therefore we live, if and we die, of the Lord we are.

9. To this for Anointed both died and lived, so that both of dead ones and living he might be lord.

10. Thou but, why judgest the brother of thee? or also thou, why settest at nought the brother of thee? all for shall stand before the judgment seat of the Anointed.

11. It has been written for: Live I, says Lord, because to me shall bend every knee, and every tongue shall confess to the God.

12. So then each one of us concerning himself an account shall give to the God.

13. No longer therefore each other we should judge; but this judge you rather, that not to place a stumblingblock to the brother or a cause of fall.

14. I know, and have been persuaded in Lord Jesus, that nothing common through itself, if not to him regarding anything common to be, to him common;

15. If but through food the brother of thee is grieved, no longer according to love dost thou walk. Not with the food of thee him do thou destroy, on behalf of whom Anointed died.

16. Not let be evil spoken of therefore of you the good.

17. Not for is the kingdom of the God eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in spirit holy;

18. he for in this doing service for the Anointed, wellpleasing to the God, and approved by the men.

19. So then the things of the peace we should pursue, and the things of the building up of that for each other.

20. Not on account of food demolish the work of the God. All things indeed you pure; but evil for the man for that through a stumblingblock eating.

21. Good the not to eat flesh, not to drink wine, nor by which the brother of thee stumbles, or in ensnared, or in weakened.

22. Thou faith hast; according to thyself hold it in presence of the God. Blessed he not judging himself in what he approves.

23. He but discerning a difference, if he should eat, has been condemned, because not from faith; every thing and which not from faith, sin is.

## Romans 15

1. Are bound and we the strong ones the infirmities of those without strength to bear, and not ourselves to please;

2. each one of us to the neighbor let please for the good to building up.

3. Also for the Anointed one not himself pleased, but, as it has been written: The reproaches of those reproaching thee, fell on me.

4. As many things as for was fore written, for the our instruction was fore written; so that through the patience and of the consolation of the writings, the hope we might have.

5. The and God of the patience and of the consolation may give to you the same to be minded among each other, according to Anointed Jesus;

6. that with one mind with one mouth you may glorify the God and Father of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.

7. Wherefore take to yourselves each other, as also the Anointed took to himself us for glory of God.

8. I say but, Jesus Anointed a servant became of circumcision, on behalf of truth of God, in order that to confirm the promises of the fathers;

9. the and nations on account of mercy to praise the God, as it has been written: Because of this I will confess to thee among nations, and to the name of thee sing praises.

10. And again it says: Rejoice you nations, with the people of him.

11. And again: Praise you the Lord all the nations, and extol you him all the peoples.

12. And again Esaias says: Shall be the root of the Jesse, and he standing up to rule nations, on him nations shall hope.

13. The and God of the hope to fill you all of joy and of peace in the believing, in order that to abound, you in the hope, in power of spirit holy.

14. I have been persuaded but, brethren of me, and myself I concerning you, that also yourselves full you are of goodness, having been filled all of knowledge, being able also reach other to admonish.

15. More boldly but I wrote to you, brethren, from of a part, as reminding you, through the favor that having been given to me by the God,

16. in order that to be me a public servant of Jesus Anointed for the nations, administering a priest the glad tidings of the God, so that may be the oblation of the nations wellpleasing, having been sanctified by spirit holy.

17. I have then a ground for boasting in Anointed Jesus the things to God;

18. not for I will dare to speak any of those things not worked out Anointed through me, for obedience of nations, in word and work; by power of signs and of wonders,

19. by power of spirit holy; so that me from Jerusalem and in a circuit, even to the Illyricum, to have fully set forth the glad tidings of the Anointed;

20. thus and being ambitious to announce glad tidings, not where was named Anointed, so that not on another foundation I should build;

21. but as it has been written: To those not it was told concerning him, shall see; and those not had heard, shall understand.

22. Wherefore also I was hindered the things many of the to come to you.

23. Now but no longer a place having in the regions these, a great desire and having of the to come to you from many years.

24. Whenever I may go to the Spain, I hope passing through to see you, and by you to be sent on my way there, if of you first from a part I should be filled.

25. Now but I am going to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints.

26. Were pleased for Macedonia and Achaia contribution some to make for the poor ones of the saints of those in Jerusalem.

27. They were pleased for, and debtors of them they are. If for in the spiritual things of them became sharers the Gentiles, they are bound also in the fleshly things to render service to them.

28. This then having finished, and having sealed to them the fruit this, I will go through of you into the Spain.

29. I know and, that coming to you, in fullness of blessing of Anointed I will come.

30. I entreat and you, brethren, by the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, and by the love of the spirit to strive together with me in the prayers on behalf of me to the God;

31. that I may be delivered from those being disobedient in the Judea, and that the service of me, that for Jerusalem, well pleasing may be to the saints;

32. so that with joy I may come to you through will of God, and may take rest together with you.

33. The and God of the peace with all of you. So be it.

## Romans 16

1. I recommend and to you Phebe, the sister of us, being a servant of the congregation of that in Cenchrea;

2. that her you may receive in Lord worthily of the saints, and you may assist her in which of you she may need business; also for she a patroness of many became, and myself of me.

3. Salute you Prisca and Aquila, the fellowworkers of me in Anointed Jesus;

4. (who on behalf of the life of me the of themselves neck they placed under; to whom not I alone give thanks, but also all the congregations of the Gentiles;)

5. also the in house of them congregation. Salute you Epenetus, the beloved one of me, who is a firstfruit of the Asia into Anointed.

6. Salute you Mary, who much labored for us.

7. Salute you Andronicus and Junias, the relatives of me and fellowprisoners of me, who are noted among the apostles, who and before me have been in Anointed.

8. Salute you Amplias, the beloved one of me in Lord.

9. Salute you Urbanus, the fellowworker of us in Anointed, and Stachys, the beloved one of me.

10. Salute you Apelles, the approved one in Anointed. Salute you those from of the Aristobulus.

11. Salute you Herodian, the relative of me. Salute you those from of the Narcissus, those being in Lord.

12. Salute you Tryphenna and Tryphosa, those laboring in Lord. Salute you Persis, the beloved one, who much labored in Lord.

13. Salute you Rufus, the chosen in Lord, and the mother of him and of me.

14. Salute you Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the with them brethren.

15. Salute you Philologus and Julia, Nereus and the sister of him, and Olympas, and the with them all saints.

16. Salute you each other with a kiss holy. Salute you the congregations all of the Anointed.

17. I entreat now you, brethren, to watch those the separations and the stumblingblocks, contrary to the teaching which you learned, are making; and turn away from them.

18. They for such like ones to the Lord of us Anointed not are in subjection, but to the of themselves belly; and through the fair speaking and good speaking they deceive the hearts of the simple ones.

19. The for you obedience for all went abroad. I rejoice therefore that in respect to you; I wish but you wise ones indeed to be in respect to the good, blameless ones but in respect to the evil.

20. The and God of the peace will crush the adversary under the feet of you in a short time. The favor of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with you.

21. Salute you Timothy, the fellowworker of me, and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, the relatives of me.

22. Salute you I Tertius, the one having written the letter, in Lord.

23. Salute you Gaius, the host of me and of the congregation whole. Salute you Erastus, the treasurer of the city, and Quartus the brother.

24. The favor of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with all of us. So be it.

25. To him now being able you to establish according to the glad tidings of me and the proclaiming of Jesus Anointed, according to a revelation of a secret in times of ages has been concealed;

26. having been manifested nut now, through and writings prophetic, according to an appointment of the agelasting God, for obedience of faith, to all the nations having been made known;

27. to only wise God, through Jesus Anointed, to him the glory for the ages. So be it.
