# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Anointed through will of God, according to a promise of life of that by Anointed Jesus,

2. to Timothy beloved a child; favor, mercy, peace from God a Father, and Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.

3. Gratitude I have to the God, to whom I offer homage from ancestors with pure conscience, as unceasingly I have the concerning thee remembrance in the prayers of me night and day,

4. longing thee to see, remembering of thee the tears, so that joy I may be filled with;

5. a remembrance taking of the in thee unfeigned faith, which dwelt first in the grandmother of thee Lois, and in the mother of thee Eunice; I have confidence and, that also in thee.

6. Through which cause I remind thee to kindle up the free gift of the God, which is in thee through the putting on of the hands of me;

7. not for gave to us the God a spirit of timidity, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

8. Not therefore thou mayest be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord of us, nor me the prisoner of him; but participate in suffering evil for the glad tidings according to power of God,

9. of the one having saved us and having called with a calling holy, not according to the works of us, but according to own purpose and favor that having been given to us in Anointed Jesus before times agelasting,

10. having been manifested but now through the appearance of the savior of us Jesus Anointed, having rendered powerless indeed the death, having illuminated but life and incorruptibility by means of the glad tidings,

11. for which was appointed I a herald and an apostle and a teacher of nations;

12. through which cause also these things I suffer, but not I am ashamed; I know for in whom I have believed, and I have confided in, because powerful he is the trust of me to guard to that the day.

13. An outline hold thou of sound words, of which from me thou didst hear, in faith and love in that in Anointed Jesus;

14. the good trust do thou guard through spirit holy, of that dwelling in us.

15. Thou knowest this, that turned away me all those in the Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16. May grant mercy the Lord to the of Onesiphorus house; because often me he refreshed, and the chain of me not he was ashamed,

17. but having been in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found;

18. (may grant to him the Lord to find mercy from Lord in that the day;) and what things in Ephesus he served, very well thou knowest.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Thou therefore, child of me, be strong in the favor in that in Anointed Jesus;

2. and the things thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things entrust thou to faithful men, who competent shall be also others to teach.

3. Thou therefore endure evil as good a soldier of Jesus Anointed.

4. No one serving as a soldier involves himself with the of the life occupations, so that the one having enlisted he may please.

5. If but also may contend any one, not is crowned, if not lawfully he may have contented.

6. The toiling husbandman it behooves first of the fruits to partake.

7. Consider thou, the things I say; may give for to thee the Lord understanding in all things.

8. Do thou remember Jesus Anointed having been raised out of dead ones, from seed of David, according to the glad tidings of me;

9. in which I suffer evil even to chains, as an evil doer; but the word of the God not is chained.

10. On account of this all things I undergo on account of the chosen ones, so that also they salvation may obtain of that in Anointed Jesus, with glory agelasting.

11. True the word; if for we died with, also we shall live with;

12. if we endure patiently, also we shall reign with; if we deny also he will deny us;

13. if faithless, he faithful remains; to deny himself not he is able.

14. These things do thou put in mind, earnestly testifying in presence of the Lord, not to dispute about words, for nothing useful, to a subversion of those hearing.

15. Be thou diligent thyself approved to present to the God, a workman unashamed, cutting straight the word of the truth.

16. The but profane empty sounds do thou avoid; to more for they will proceed impiety,

17. and the word of them as a mortifying sore pasture will have; of whom is Hymenius and Philetus,

18. who concerning the truth missed the mark, saying the resurrection already to have happened, and overturn the of some faith.

19. The however firm foundation of the God stands, having the zeal this: Knew Lord the being of himself; and: Let depart from injustice every one who is naming the name of Lord.

20. In great but a house not is only vessels golden and made of silver, but also wooden and earthen; and some indeed for honor, some and for dishonor.

21. If therefore any one should well cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, having been cleansed, and of good use to the master, for every work good having been prepared.

22. The now youthful desires flee thou; pursue thou but righteousness, faith, love, peace with those calling on the Lord out of pure a heart.

23. The but foolish and uninstructive questions do thou avoid, knowing, that they beget contests;

24. a bondman but of lord not it behooves to quarrel, but gentle to be to all, fit to teach, enduring evil,

25. in meekness admonishing those being opposed; perhaps may give to them the God a change of mind to a knowledge of truth,

26. and they may be recovered from the of the accuser snare having been taken alive by him for the of him will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. This but know thou, that in latter days will be present seasons trying.

2. Will be for the men selflovers, moneylovers, boasters, haughty ones, revilers, to parents disobedient, unthankful ones, unholy ones,

3. void of natural affection, implacable, accusers, without selfcontrol, fierce ones, without love to good men,

4. betrayers, rash ones, having been puffed up, pleasurelovers rather than Godlovers;

5. having a form of piety, the but power of her having denied. Also these turn away from.

6. Out of these for are those entering into the houses and leading captive little women having been laden with sins, being led away by inordinate desires various,

7. always learning, and never into a knowledge of truth to come are able.

8. Which way but Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these are opposed to the truth, men having corrupted the mind, disapproved ones concerning the faith.

9. But not they shall proceed to more; the for folly of them very plain shall be to all, as also that of those became.

10. Thou but hast closely followed of me the teaching, the conduct, the purpose, the fidelity, the forbearance, the love, the patience,

11. the persecutions, the sufferings, what things to me happened in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all me delivered the Lord.

12. Indeed all but those wishing piously to live in Anointed Jesus, will be persecuted.

13. Evil but men and jugglers will progress to the worse, deceiving and being deceived.

14. Thou but able in the things thou didst learn and wast convinced of, knowing, from whom thou didst learn,

15. and that from a babe the holy writings thou knowest, those being able thee to make wise for salvation, through faith of that in Anointed Jesus.

16. All writing inspired of God and profitable for teaching, for proof, for correction, for turning up that in righteousness;

17. so that complete may be the of the God man, for every work good having been thoroughly fitted,

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I solemnly charge in presence of the God, and Jesus Anointed of that one being about to judge living ones and dead ones, and the appearing of himself and the kingdom of himself;

2. publish thou the word, be thou urgent seasonably unseasonably, confute thou, rebuke thou, exhort thou with all long suffering and teaching.

3. Will be for a season, when of the wholesome teaching not they will endure, but according to the own desires of themselves they will heap up teachers, tickling the ear;

4. and from indeed of the truth the hearing they will turn away, to but the fables they will be turned aside.

5. Thou but be sober in all things, suffer thou evil, work do thou of a proclaimer of glad tidings, the service of thee do thou fully perform.

6. I for already and being poured out, and the season of the of my dissolution has come near;

7. the contest the good I have contested, the race I have finished, the faith I have guarded;

8. remaining is laid up for me the of the righteousness crown, which will give to me the Lord in that the day, the righteous judge, not only but to me, but also to all to those having loved the appearance of him.

9. Earnestly endeavor to come to me soon.

10. Demas for me forsook, having loved the present age, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia;

11. Luke is alone with me. Mark having taken up do thou bring with thyself; he is for to me very useful for service.

12. Tychicus but I sent to Ephesus.

13. The cloak, which I left in Troas with Carpus, coming bring thou, and the written rolls, especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith many to me evil things openly showed; may give to him the Lord according to the works of him;

15. whom also thou beware, greatly for he has opposed the our words.

16. In the first of me defense no one by me stood, but all me forsook; (not to them may it be imputed;)

17. the but Lord by me stood, and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully established, and might hear all the nations; and I was delivered out of mouth of a lion;

18. and will deliver me the Lord from every work evil, and will save for the kingdom of himself the heavenly; to whom the glory for the ages of the ages; so be it.

19. Salute thou Prisca and Aquila, and the of Onesiphorus house.

20. Erastus remained in Corinth; Trophimus but i left in Miletus being sick.

21. Earnestly endeavor before winter to come. Salute thee Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and the brethren all.

22. The Lord Jesus Anointed with the spirit of thee. The favor with you.
