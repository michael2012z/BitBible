## 3 John 1

1. The elder to Gaius the beloved one, whom I love in truth.

2. O beloved one, concerning all things I wish thee to prosper and to be in health, even as prospers thee the life.

3. I rejoiced for greatly, coming brethren and testifying of the in the truth, even as thou in truth walkest.

4. Greater of these not I have joy, that I hear the my children in truth walking.

5. O beloved one, faithfully thou doest whatever thou mayest work for the brethren and in the strangers,

6. these bore testimony of thee to the love in presence of congregation; whom well thou wilt do having sent forward worthily of the God.

7. On behalf for of the name they went forth, nothing receiving from the Gentiles.

8. We therefore ought to receive the such like ones, that coÂ–workers we may become in the truth.

9. I wrote to the congregation; but the one loving to be first of them Diotrephes not receives us.

10. On account of this, if I come, I will remember of him the works which he does, with words evil prating against us; and not being satisfied in these things, not even he receives the brethren, and those wishing he forbids, and out of the congregation he casts.

11. O beloved one, not do thou imitate the evil thing, but the good thing. The one doing good, of the God is; the one doing evil, not has seen the God.

12. Demetrius has been testified to by all, and by herself the truth; also we and testify, and you know, that the testimony of us true is.

13. Many things I had to write, but not I wish by means of ink and pen to thee to write;

14. I hop but immediately to see thee, and mouth to mouth we will speak.

15. Peace to thee. Salute thee the friends; do thou salute the friends by name.
