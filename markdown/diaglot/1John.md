## 1 John 1

1. What was from a beginning, what we have heard, what we have see with the eyes of us, what we gazed on, and the hands of us felt, concerning the Word of the life;

2. (and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and we bear testimony, and we declare to you the life the agelasting, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)

3. what we have seen and we have heard, we declare to you, so that also you fellowship may have with us; indeed the fellowship and the our with the Father and with the son of him Jesus Anointed.

4. And these things we write to you, so that the joy of you may be complete.

5. And this is the message, which we have heard from him and announce to you, that the God light is, and darkness in him not is any.

6. If we should say, that fellowship we have with him and in the darkness we should walk, we speak falsely, and not we do the truth;

7. if but in the light we should walk, as he is in the light, fellowship we have with each other, and the blood of Jesus Anointed the son of him cleanses us from all sin.

8. If we should say, that sin not we have, ourselves we deceive, and the truth not is in us.

9. If we confess the the sins of us, faithful he is and just so that he may forgive to us the sins, and he may cleanse us from all righteousness.

10. If we should say, that not we have sinned, a liar we make him, and the word of him not is in us.

## 1 John 2

1. Dear children of me, these things I write to you, so that not you may sin; and if any one should sin, a helper we have with the Father, Jesus Anointed a just one;

2. and he a propitiation is on account of the sins of us, not on account of the ours but only, but also on account of whole of the world.

3. And by this we know, that we have known him, if the commandment of him we keep.

4. The one saying: I have known him, and the commandments of him not keeping, a liar he is, and in this one the truth not is.

5. Who but may keep of him the word, truly in this one the love of the God has been perfected. By this we know, that in him we are.

6. The one saying in him to abide, is bound, as he walked, also himself thus to walk.

7. Beloved ones, not a commandment new I write to you, but a commandment old, which you had from a beginning; the commandment the old, is the word which you heard from a beginning.

8. Again a commandment new I write to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the light the true now shines.

9. The one saying in the light to be, and the brother of himself hating, in the darkness he is till now.

10. The one loving the brother of himself, in the light abides, and a stumblingblock in him not is;

11. the but one hating the brother of himself, in the darkness is, and in the darkness walks, and not knows where he goes, because the darkness blinded the eyes of him.

12. I write to you, O dear children, because are forgiven to you the sins through the name of him.

13. I write to you, O fathers, because you have known him from a beginning; I write to you, O young men, because you have overcome the evil one; I write to you, children, because you have known the Father.

14. I wrote to you, O fathers, because you have known him from a beginning. I wrote to you, O young men, because strong ones you are, and the word of the God in you abides, and you have overcome the evil one.

15. Not do you love the world, not the things in the world. If any one should love the world, not is the love of the Father in him;

16. because all that in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pomp of the life, not is from the Father, but from the world is.

17. And the world passes away, and the lust of it; the but one doing the will of the God, abides for the age.

18. Children, last hour is it; and as you heard, that the antichrist is coming, even now antichrists many have become; whence we know, that last hour it is.

19. From of us they went out, but not they were of us; if for they were of us, they would have remained with us; but so that they might be manifested, that not they are all of us.

20. And you an anointing have from the holy, and you know all things.

21. Not I wrote to you, because not you know the truth, but because you know her, and because every lie from the truth not is.

22. Who is the lair, if not the one denying, that Jesus not is the Anointed one? this is the antichrist, the one denying the Father and the son.

23. Every one the denying the son, not even the Father has; the one confessing the son, also the Father has.

24. You therefore what heard from a beginning, in you let abide; if in you should abide what from a beginning you heard, also you in the son and in the Father will abide.

25. And this is the promise, which he promised to us, the life the agelasting.

26. These things I wrote to you concerning those deceiving you.

27. And you the anointing which received from him, in you abides, and not need you have, so that any one may teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and true is, and not is a lie; and as it taught you, do you abide in him.

28. And how, dear children, do you abide in him; so that when he may appear, we may have boldness, and not we may be put to shame from him, in the presence of him.

29. If you may know, that righteous he is, you know, that every one the doing the righteousness, by him has been begotten.

## 1 John 3

1. See you, what love has given to us the Father, so that children of God we should be called. On account of this the world not knows us, because not it knew him.

2. Beloved ones, now children of God we are, and not yet was it brought to light, what we shall be; we know but, that if he should appear, like to him we shall be; because we shall see him, as he is.

3. And every one the having the hope this in him, purifies himself, as he pure is.

4. Every one the doing the sin, also the lawlessness does; and the sin is the lawlessness.

5. And you know, that he was manifested, so that the sins of us he might take away; and sin in him not is.

6. Every one the in him abiding, not sins; every one the sinning, not has seen him, nor has known him.

7. Dear children, no one let deceive you; the one doing the righteousness, righteous is, as he righteous is.

8. The one doing the sin, from the accuser is; because from a beginning the accuser sins. For this was manifested the son of the God, so that he might destroy the works of the accuser.

9. Every one the having been begotten of the God, sin not does, because seed of him in him abides; and not is able to sin, because by the God he has been begotten.

10. In this manifest is the children of the God and the children of the accuser. Every one the not doing righteousness, not is of the God, and the not one loving the brother of himself.

11. Because this is the message, which you heard from beginning, that we should love each other;

12. not as Cain of the evil one was, and killed the brother of himself; and on account of what killed he him? because the works of him evil was, those but of the brother of him righteous.

13. Not do you wonder, brethren of me, if hates you the world.

14. We know, that we have passed over from the death into the life, because we love the brethren; the not loving the brother, abides in the death.

15. Every one the hating the brother of himself, a man killer is; and we know, that every man killer not has life agelasting in him abiding.

16. By this we have known the love, because he on behalf of us the life of himself laid down; and we ought on behalf of the brethren the lives to lay down.

17. Who but may have the substance of the world, and may see the brother of himself need having, and may close the bowels of himself from him, how the love of the God abides in him?

18. Dear children of me, not we should love in word nor in the tongue, but in work and in truth.

19. And by this we know, that of the truth we are, and in presence of him we shall assure the hearts of us,

20. because, if should condemn us the heart, that greater is the God of the heart of us, and knows all things.

21. Beloved ones, if the heart of us not should condemn us, boldness we have towards the God,

22. and whatever we may ask, we receive from him, because the commandments of him we keep, and the things pleasing in presence of him we do.

23. And this is the commandment of him, that we should believe in the name of the son of him Jesus Anointed, and should love each other, as he gave commandment to us.

24. And the one keeping the commandments of him, in him abides, and he in him; and by this we know, that he abides in us, from the spirit, of which to us he gave.

## 1 John 4

1. Beloved ones, not every spirit do you believe, but do you prove the spirits, if from of the God is; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

2. By this you know the spirit of the God; every spirit which confesses Jesus Anointed in flesh having come, from of the God is.

3. And every spirit who not confesses the Jesus, from the God not is; and this is that of the antichrist, which you heard that it comes, and now in the world is already.

4. You of the God are, dear children, and have overcome them; because greater is he in you, than he in the world.

5. They from the world are; on account of this of the world they speak, and the world them hears.

6. We of the God are; the one knowing the God, hear us; who not is of the God, not hears us. By this we know the spirit of the truth and the spirit of the error.

7. Beloved ones, we should love each other; because the love of the God is, and every one the loving, by the God has been begotten, and knows the God;

8. he not loving, not knew the God, because the God love is.

9. in this was manifested the love of the God in us, because the son of himself the onlybegotten sent forth the God into the world, so that we might live through him.

10. In this is the love, not that we loved the God, but that he loved us, and sent forth the son of himself a propitiation respecting the sins of us.

11. Beloved ones, if thus the God loved us, also we ought each other to love. God no one at any time has seen.

12. If we love each other, the God in us abides, and the love of him having been perfected it is in us.

13. By this we know, that in him we abide, and he in us, because out of the spirit of himself he has given us.

14. And we have seen and we testify, that the Father sent forth the son a savior of the world.

15. Whoever may confess, that Jesus is the son of the God, the God in him abides, and he in the God.

16. And we have known and we have believed the love, which has the God in us. The God love is, and the one abiding in the love, in the God abides, and the God in him.

17. By this has been perfected the love with us, so that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because as he is, also we are in the world this.

18. Fear not is in the love, but the perfect love outside casts the fear; because the fear a restraint has; the but one fearing not has been perfected in the love.

19. We love him, because he first loved us.

20. If any one may say: That I love the God, and the brother of himself he may hate, a liar he is; the for not one loving the brother of himself, whom he has seen, the God, whom not he has seen, how is he able to love?

21. And this the commandment we have from him, that the one loving the God should love also the brother of himself.

## 1 John 5

1. Every one the believing, that Jesus is the Anointed, by the God has been begotten; and every one the loving the one having begot, love also the one having been begotten by him.

2. By this we know, that we love the children of the God, when the God we may love and the commandments of him we may keep.

3. This for is the love of the God, that the commandments of him we may keep; and the commandments of him burdensome not are,

4. because all that having been begotten by the God, overcomes the world; and this is the victory that having overcome the world, the faith of us.

5. Who is the one overcoming the world, if not the one believing, that Jesus is the son of the God?

6. This is the one having come by means of water and blood, Jesus the Anointed; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood; and the spirit is the one testifying, because the spirit is the truth.

7. Because three are those testifying;

8. the spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three for the one are.

9. If the testimony of the men we receive, the testimony of the God greater is; because this is the testimony of the God, which he has testified concerning the son of himself.

10. The one believing into the son of the God, has the testimony in himself; the not one believing the God, a liar has made him, because not he has believed in the testimony, which has testified the god concerning the son of himself.

11. And this is the testimony because life agelasting gave to us the God, and this the life in the son of him is.

12. The one having the son, has the life; the not one having the son of the God, the life not has.

13. These things I wrote to you, so that you may know, that life agelasting you have those believing into the name of the son of the God.

14. And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if anything we may ask according to the will of him, he hears us;

15. and if we know, that he hears us, whatever we may ask, we know, that we have the petitions which we have asked from him.

16. If any one should see the brother of himself sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask, and he will give to him life, for those sinning not to death. It is a sin to death; not concerning that I say that he should ask.

17. All unrighteousness sin is; and it is a sin not to death.

18. We know, that every one the having been begotten by the God, not sins; but the one having been begotten by the God, keeps himself, and the evil one not lays hold of him.

19. We know, that from the God we are, and the world whole in the evil one lies.

20. And we know, that the son of the God is come, and has given to us an understanding, so that we might know the true one; and we are in the true one, in the son of him Jesus Anointed. This is the true God, and the life agelasting.

21. Dear children, do you keep yourselves from the idols.
