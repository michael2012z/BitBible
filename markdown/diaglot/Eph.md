## Ephesians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Anointed through will of God, to the saints to those being in Ephesus even to believers in Anointed Jesus;

2. favor to you and peace from God a Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed. Ephesians

3. Worthy of praise the God and Father of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, he having blessed us with every blessing spiritual in the heavenlies in Anointed;

4. even as he chose us in him before a casting down of a world, to have us holy ones and blameless ones in sight of him;

5. in love having previously marked out us for sonship through Jesus Anointed for himself, according to the good pleasure of the will of himself,

6. for a praise of glory of the favor of himself, with which he favored us in the one having been beloved,

7. by whom we have the redemption through the blood of him, the forgiveness of the faults, according to the wealth of the favor of him,

8. which he caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence,

9. having made known to us the secret of the will of himself according to the good pleasure of himself, which he before purposed in himself,

10. for an administration of the fulness of the seasons, to reduce under one head the things all in the Anointed, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in him,

11. by whom also we obtained a portion, having been previously marked out according to a design of the the things all operating according to the counsel of the will of himself,

12. in order that to be us for a praise of the glory of him, those having been before hopers in the Anointed;

13. in whom also you (having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of the salvation of you,) in whom also having believed you were sealed with the spirit of the promise with the holy,

14. which is a pledge of the inheritance of us in a redemption of the possession, for a praise of the glory of him.

15. On account of this even I having heard the in you faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love that for all the holy ones,

16. not I cease giving thanks on behalf of you, a remembrance of you making in the prayers of me;

17. that the God of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, the Father of the glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in full knowledge of him.

18. Having been enlightened the eyes of the heart of you, for the to know you, what is the hope of the calling of you, and what the wealth of the glory of the inheritance of him in the holy ones,

19. and what the surpassing greatness of the power of him towards us, those believing according to the operation of the strength of the might of him,

20. which he exerted in the Anointed, having raised up him out of dead ones; and seated at right of himself in the heavenlies,

21. far above every government and authority and power and lordship, and every name being named not only in the age this, but also in the one about coming;

22. and all things placed under the feet of him; and him he gave a head over all things for the congregation,

23. which is the body of him, the completeness of him the things all with all things is filling;

## Ephesians 2

1. and you being dead ones in the faults and the sins;

2. (in which once you walked according to the age of the world this, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit of that now operating in the sons of the disobedience;

3. among whom also we all lived once in the desires of the flesh of us, doing the wishes of the flesh and of the thoughts, and we were children by nature of wrath, as also the others;

4. the but God, rich being in mercy, through the much love of himself, with which he loved us,)

5. and being us dead ones in the faults, he quickened together with the Anointed; (by favor you are having been saved;)

6. and raised up together, and seated together in the heavenlies by Anointed Jesus, Ephesians

7. that he may point out in the ages those coming the surpassing wealth of the favor of himself, by kindness towards us in Anointed Jesus.

8. By the for favor you are having been saved through the faith; and this not from you; of God the gift,

9. not from works; so that not any one should boast.

10. Of him for we are a work having been formed in Anointed Jesus for works good, in which before prepared the God that in them we should walk.

11. Therefore remember, that you once Gentiles in flesh, (those being called uncircumcision by the being called circumcision in flesh done by hand,)

12. that you were in the season that, without Anointed, having been aliens from the common wealth of the Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, a hope not having, and godless, in the world;

13. now but, in Anointed Jesus, you those once being far off, near were made by the blood of the Anointed.

14. He for is the peace of us, the one having made the things both one, and the middle wall of the fence having broken up,

15. the enmity; by the flesh of himself the law of the commandments in ordinances having made powerless; so that the two he might form in himself into one new man, making peace;

16. and he might reconcile the both in one body to the God through the cross, having killed the enmity by it.

17. And having come he announced as glad tidings peace to you to those far off and to those near,

18. because through him we have the access the both with one spirit to the Father. Ephesians

19. So then no longer you are strangers and sojourners, but fellowcitizens of the holy ones and familymembers of the God,

20. having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, being a cornerfoundation of it Jesus Anointed;

21. on which all the building being fitly compacted together grows up into the temple holy in Lord;

22. on which also you are built up together, for salvation of the God in spirit.

## Ephesians 3

1. For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of the Anointed Jesus because of you of the Gentiles;

2. if indeed you heard the administration of the favor of the God of that having been given to me for you,

3. because according to a revelation he made known to me the secret; (as I wrote before in brief,

4. by which you are able reading to perceive the intelligence of me in the secret of the Anointed;)

5. which in other generation not was made known to the sons of the men, as now it was revealed to the holy ones apostles of him and prophets by spirit;

6. to be the Gentiles jointheirs and jointbody and jointpartakers of the promise of him in the Anointed, through the glad tidings;

7. of which I became a servant according to the gift of the favor of the God, of that having been given to me according to the operation of the power of him;

8. to me the far inferior of all holy ones; was given the favor this, among the nations to announce glad tidings the unsearchable wealth of the Anointed,

9. and to enlighten all, what the administration of the secret of that having been hidden from the ages in the God in that the all things having created;

10. so that might be made known now to the governments and to the authorities in the heavenlies, through the congregation, the manifold wisdom of the God;

11. according to a plan of the ages, which he formed in Anointed Jesus the Lord of us; Ephesians

12. by whom we have the freedom of speech and the access with confidence, through the faith of him.

13. Therefore I ask not to faint in the afflictions of me on behalf of you, which is glory of you.

14. For this cause I bend the knees of me to the Father of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed,

15. from whom whole family in heavens and on earth is named,

16. so that he may give to you according to the wealth of the glory of himself, with power to be strengthened through the spirit of himself, in the within men;

17. to have dwelt the Anointed through the faith in the hearts of you,

18. in love having been rooted and having been founded so that you may be fully able to understand with all the holy ones, what the breadth and length and depth and height,

19. to have known even the surpassing of the knowledge love of the Anointed; that you may be filled up to all the fulness of the God.

20. To the now one being powerful above all to have done far exceeding what things we ask or we think, according to the power that operating in us,

21. to him the glory in the congregation by Anointed Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. So be it.

## Ephesians 4

1. I exhort therefore you, I the prisoner in Lord, worthily to walk of the calling with which you were called,

2. with all humility and gentleness, with patience; bearing with each other in love, Ephesians

3. using diligence to keep the oneness of the spirit by the uniting bond of the peace. Ephesians

4. One body and one spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of the calling of you;

5. one Lord, one faith, one dipping,

6. one God and Father of all, he over all and through all and in all to us.

7. To one but each one of us was given the favor according to the measure of the free gift of the Anointed.

8. (Therefore it says: Having ascended on high he captivated captivity, and he gave gifts to the men.

9. This but, he ascended, what is it, if not that also he descended into the lower parts of the earth?

10. The one having descended, he is also the one having ascended far above all of thew heavens, so that he might fill the all things).

11. And he gave the indeed apostles, the and prophets, the and evangelists, the and shepherds and teachers,

12. for the complete qualification of the holy ones for a work of service, for a building up of the body of the Anointed;

13. till we may attain the all to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of the God, to a man perfect, to a measure of stature of the fulness of the Anointed;

14. so that no longer we may be babes, being tossed and being whirled about with every wind of the teachings, in the trickery of the men, by cunning with the method of the deceit;

15. being truthful but in love, we may grow into him the all things, who is the head, the Anointed;

16. from whom all the body, (being fitly joined together and being compacted by means of every joint of the supply according to inworking,) by a measure of one of each part the growth of the body makes, for a building up of itself in love.

17. This then I say, and testify in Lord, no longer you to walk, as also the others Gentiles walks in vanity of the mind of them,

18. having been darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of the God, through the ignorance that being in them, through the stupidity of the heart of them; Ephesians

19. who having become callous, themselves gave over to the lewdness for a work of impurity all with eagerness.

20. You but not thus learned the Anointed,

21. if indeed him you heard and by him were taught, as is truth in the Jesus; Ephesians

22. to put from you, according to the former course of life, the old man, that being corrupt according to the inordinate desires of the deceit;

23. to be renewed and in the spirit of the mind of you,

24. and be you clothed with the new man, that according to God having been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.

25. Therefore putting away the falsehood, speak you truth, each one with the neighbor of himself; because we are of each other members.

26. Be you angry and not do you sin; the sun not let it set on the wrath of you;

27. not even give you a place for the accuser.

28. The one stealing no longer let him steal, rather but let him toil working the good thing with the hands, so that he may have to give to the one want having.

29. Every word rotten out of the mouth of you not let go forth, but, if anything good for a building up of the use, that it may give benefit to those hearing;

30. and not grieve you the spirit the holy of the God, by which you were sealed for a day of redemption.

31. All bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evilspeaking let be taken from you, with all malice;

32. become you and towards each other kind ones, tender hearted ones, showing favor to others, even as also the God in Anointed showed favor to you.

## Ephesians 5

1. Become you therefore imitators of the God, as children beloved;

2. walk you in love, even as also the Anointed loved us, and delivered up himself on behalf of us an offering and a sacrifice, to the God for an odor of a sweet smell.

3. Fornication but and all impurity or unbridled lust not even let it be named among you, (as it becomes holy ones,)

4. also indecency, and foolish talking or loose jesting, the things not becoming; but rather thanksgiving.

5. This for you know knowing, that every fornicator or impure person or lascivious person, who is an idol worshipper, not has an inheritance in the kingdom of the Anointed one and of God.

6. No one you let deceive with empty words; on account of these things for comes the wrath of the God on the sons of the disobedience.

7. Not therefore become you associates of them.

8. You were indeed once darkness, now but light in Lord; as children of light walk you;

9. (the for fruit of the light in all goodness and truth;)

10. searching out what is wellpleasing to the Lord;

11. and not be you jointpartakers with the works with those unfruitful of the darkness, rather but even do you reprove.

12. The things for in secret being done by them, indecent it is even to say.

13. The but all things, being exposed by the light, are manifested; every thing for that is being manifested, light is.

14. Therefore it says: Awake thou the one sleeping, and arise thou out of the dead ones, and will shine on thee the Anointed.

15. See you then, how accurately you walk; not as unwise ones, but as wise ones;

16. buying for yourselves the season, because the days evil are.

17. Because of this not become you simple ones, but understanding what the will of the Lord.

18. And not be you drunk with wine, in which is profligacy, but be you filled with spirit,

19. speaking yourselves in psalms and hymns and songs spiritual singing and making music in the heart of you to the Lord;

20. giving thanks at all times on behalf of all, in name the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, to the God and Father;

21. submitting yourselves to each other in fear of Anointed;

22. the wives to the own husbands be you submissive, as to the Lord; Ephesians

23. because a husband is a head of the wife, as even the Anointed a head of the congregation; he is a preserver of the body.

24. But even as the congregation is subjected to the Anointed, thus also the wives to the own husbands in everything.

25. The husbands, love you the wives of yourselves, even as also the Anointed loved the congregation, and himself delivered up on behalf of her,

26. so that her he might sanctify, having cleansed in the bath of the water by a word; Ephesians

27. that might place beside he himself glorious the congregation, not having a spot or blemish or any of such like things, but that she might be holy and blameless.

28. Thus are obligated the husbands to love the of themselves wives, as the of themselves bodies. He loving the of himself wife, himself loves;

29. no one for ever the of himself flesh hated, but nourishes and cherishes her; as even the Anointed the congregation;

30. because members we are of the body of him, out of the flesh of him, and out of the bones of him.

31. On account of this shall leave a man the father of himself and the mother, and shall be closely joined to the wife of himself, and will be the two into flesh one.

32. The secret this great is; I but speak about Anointed, and about the congregation.

33. But also you the every one, each one the of himself wife thus let love as himself; the and wife so that she may reverence the husband.

## Ephesians 6

1. The children, be you subject to the parents of you in Lord; this thing for is just. Ephesians

2. Honor the father of thee and the mother; (which is a commandment first, with a promise;)

3. that well with thee it may be, and thou mayest be longlived on the land; Ephesians

4. and the fathers, not irritate you the children of you, but bring you up them in disciples and instruction of Lord.

5. The slaves, be you submissive to the lords according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of the heart of you, at to the Anointed;

6. not by eyeservice as menpleasers, but as slaves of the Anointed, doing the will of the God from soul,

7. with goodwill serving, as to the Lord and not to men;

8. knowing, that whatever any each one may do good thing, this he will receive from Lord, whether a slave, or a freeman.

9. And the lords, the same things do you to them, omitting the treat; knowing, that also of you of them the Lord is in heavens, and respect of persons not is with him.

10. The rest, brethren of me, strengthen yourselves in Lord and in the power of the might of him.

11. Put you on the complete armor of the God, for that to enable you to stand against the crafty ways of the accuser;

12. because not is to us the comfort with blood and flesh, but with the governments, with the authorities, with the worldrulers of the darkness of this, with the spiritual things of the evil one, in the heavenlies.

13. Because of this take you up the complete armor of the God, so that you may be able to stand against in the day the evil, and all things having worked out to stand.

14. Stand you therefore having girded the loins of you with truth, and having put on the breastplate of the righteousness,

15. and having shod the feet with a preparation of the glad tidings of the peace; Ephesians

16. besides all having taken up the shield of the faith, by which you will be able all the darts of the evil one the having been kindled to quench;

17. also the helmet of the salvation take you, and the sword of the spirit, which is a word of God;

18. by means of every prayer and supplication praying in every season in spirit; and for it this watching with all perseverance and supplication for all of the holy ones,

19. and on behalf of me, that to me may be given a word in opening of the mouth of me, with boldness to make known the secret of the glad tidings,

20. on account of which I am on an embassy in a chain, that in it I may speak boldly, as it behooves me to speak.

21. That but may know also you the things concerning me, what I am doing, all things to you will make known Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful servant in Lord;

22. whom I sent to you for same this thing, that you may know the things concerning us, and he might comfort the hearts of you.

23. Peace to the brethren and love with faith from God a Father and Lord Jesus Anointed.

24. The favor with all of the ones loving the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with incorruptness.
