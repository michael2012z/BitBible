25. but not he knew her till she brought forth the a son of her the first born; and called the name of him Jesus.

## Matthew 2

1. The and Jesus being born in Bethleem of the Judea, in days of Herod the king, lo, wiseman from an east country came into Jerusalem, saying:

2. Where is the newborn king of the Jews? we saw for of him the star in the rising, and are come to do homage of him.

3. Having heard and Herod the king was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him;

4. and having called together all the chiefpriests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Anointed should be born.

5. They and said to him: In Bethleem of the Judea; thus for is written by the prophet;

6. And thou Bethleem, land of Juda; by no means least art among the princes of Juda; out of thee for shall come forth a prince, who shall govern the people of me, the Israel.

7. Then Herod privately having called the wisemen, learned exactly from them the time of the appearing a star,

8. and sending them into Bethleem, he said: Passing on your way, exactly inquire about the infant; as soon as and you have found, bring word to me, that I also going pay homage to him.

9. They and having heard the king departed. And lo, the star, which they saw in the rising, went before them, till going it stood over where was the infant.

10. Seeing and the star, they rejoiced a joy very great;

11. and being come into the house, they saw the infant with Mary the mother of it, and falling down did homage to it, and opening the treasuries of them, they offered to it gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

12. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, by another way they withdrew into the country of them.

13. Having withdrawn but of the, lo, a messenger of a Lord appears in a dream to the Joseph, saying: Arising take the infant and the mother of it, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there, till I speak to thee; is about for Herod to seek the infant, to kill it.

14. He then arising took the infant and the mother of it by night, and went into Egypt;

15. and he was there till the death of Herod; that might be fulfilled the word spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt I called the son of me.

16. Then Herod seeing that he was mocked by the wisemen, was enraged much; and sending forth he slew all the boys the in Bethleem and in all the borders of her, from two years and under, according to the time which he exactly learnt from the wisemen.

17. Then was fulfilled the word spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

18. A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and weeping and mourning great; Rachel bewailing the children of her; and not is willing to be comforted because not they are.

19. Having died and of the Herod, lo, a messenger of a Lord in a dream appears to the Joseph in Egypt, saying:

20. Arising take the infant and the mother of it, and go thou into land Israel; they are dead for the seeking the life of the infant.

21. He and arising took the infant and the mother of it, and came into land Israel.

22. Hearing and, that Archelaus was reigning over the Judea instead of Herod the father of him, he was afraid there to go; being warned and in a dream, he withdrew into regions of the Galilee.

23. And coming he dwelt into a city named Nazareth; that might be fulfilled the words spoken through the prophets, that a Nazarene he will be called.

## Matthew 3

1. In now the days those comes John the dipper, proclaiming in the desert of the Judea, and saying:

2. Reform ye; has come nigh for the majesty of the heavens.

3. This for is he spoken of by Esaias the prophet, saying: A voice crying out in the desert; make you ready the way of a Lord, straight make ye the beaten tracks of him.

4. He and the John had the outer garment of him from hairs of a camel, and a belt made of skin around the loins of him; the and food of him was locusts and honey wild.

5. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all the Judea, and all the country about of the Jordan;

6. and were dipped into the Jordan by him, confessing the sins of them.

7. Seeing and many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the dipping of him, he said to them: O broods of venomous serpents, who pointed out to you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Bring forth then fruit worthy of the reformation,

9. and not think to say in yourselves: A father we have the Abraham; I say for to you, that is able the God out of the stones these to raise up children to the Abraham.

10. Now and even the axe to the root of the trees lies; every therefore tree not bearing fruit good, is cut down, and into a fire cast.

11. I indeed dip you in water, into reformation; he but after of me coming, mightier of me is, of whom not I am worthy the sandals to carry; he you will dip in spirit holy and fire.

12. Of whom the winnowing shovel in the hand of him, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing floor of him; and he will gather the wheat of him into the storehouse, the but chaff he will burn up in fire inextinguishable.

13. Then comes the Jesus from the Galilee to the Jordan to the John, of the to be dipped by him.

14. The but John refused him saying: I need to have by thee to be dipped, and thou comest to me?

15. Answering and the Jesus said to him: Permit now; thus for coming it is to us, to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.

16. And having dipped the Jesus went up immediately from the water; and lo, were opened to him the heavens, and was seen the spirit of the God descending like a dove, and coming on him.

17. And lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying: This is the son of me the beloved, in whom I delight.

## Matthew 4

1. Then the Jesus was led into the desert by the spirit, to be tempted by the accuser.

2. And fasting days forty and nights forty, after he was hungry.

3. And coming to him the temper, said: If a son thou be of the God, speak, that the stones these loaves may become.

4. He but answering said: It is written: Not by bread alone shall live a man; but by every word proceeding from mouth of God.

5. Then takes him the accuser into the holy city, and places him on the wing of the temple,

6. and saying to him: if a son thou be of the God, cast thyself down; it is written for: That to the messengers of him he will give charge of thee; and on hands they shall raise thee, lest thou strikes against a stone the foot of thee.

7. Said to him the Jesus: Again it is written: Not thou shalt put to the proof Lord the God of thee.

8. Again takes him the accuser into a mountain high exceedingly, and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,

9. and says to him: These all to thee I will give, if falling down thou wilt do homage to me.

10. Then says to him the Jesus: Go thou behind of me, adversary; it is written for: Lord the God of thee thou shalt worship, and to him only thou shalt render service.

11. Then leaves him the accuser; and lo, messengers came and ministered to him.

12. Hearing now the Jesus, that John was delivered up, he withdrew into the Galilee.

13. And having left the Nazareth, coming dwelt at Capernaum the by the seaside, in borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;

14. that might be fulfilled the word spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying:

15. Land of Zabulon and land Nephthalim way of the sea by the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

16. The people who are sitting in darkness saw a light great; and to those sitting in a region even a shade of death, a light has arisen to them.

17. From that time began the Jesus to proclaim, and to say: Reform; has come nigh for the royal dignity of the heavens.

18. Walking and by the sea of the Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon the called Peter, and Andrew the brother of him, casting a fishingnet into the sea; they were for fishers.

19. And he says to them: Come behind of me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. They and immediately leaving the nets, followed him.

21. And going on from thence, he saw other two brothers, James the of the Zebedee and John the brother of him in the ship with Zebedee of the father of them, mending the nets of them; and called them.

22. They and forthwith leaving the ship and the father of them, followed him.

23. And went about all the Galilee the Jesus, teaching in the synagogues of them, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every malady among the people.

24. And went the report of him into all the Syria; and they brought to him all the sick having, various diseases and torments seized with, and demoniacs, and lunaties, and paralytics; and he cured them.

25. And followed to him crowds great from the Galilee, and Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond of the Jordan.

## Matthew 5

1. Seeing and the multitudes, he went up to the mountain; and having seated himself, came to him the disciples of him;

2. and opening the mouth of him, he taught them, saying:

3. Blessed the poor to the spirit; because of them is the kingdom of the heavens.

4. Blessed the mourners, for they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

6. Blessed the hungering and thirsting the righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

7. Blessed the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.

8. Blessed the clean to the heart, for they the God shall see.

9. Blessed the peacemakers, for they sons of God shall be called.

10. Blessed those being persecuted on account of righteousness, for of them is the kingdom of the heavens.

11. Blessed are ye, whenever they reproach you and persecute, and say every evil word against you, speaking falsely, because of me.

12. Rejoice ye and exult ye, for the reward of you great in the heavens; in this way for they persecuted the prophets those before you.

13. You are the salt of the earth. If but the salt become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? for nothing is it of service any more, except to be cast out, and trodden under foot by the men.

14. You are the light of the world. Not possible a city to hide upon a hill being situated;

15. nor they light a lamp, and place him under the measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to all those in the house.

16. Thus let it shine the light of you in the presence of the men, that they may see of you the good works, and may praise the Father of you that in the heavens.

17. Not think ye, that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; not I have come to destroy, but to fulfill.

18. Indeed for I say to you, till pass away the heaven and the earth, iota one or one fine point in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

19. Whoever therefore breaks one of the commandments of these of the least, and teach thus the men, least he shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens; who but ever shall do and teach, the same great shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens.

20. I say for to you that except abound the righteousness of you more of the scribes and Pharisees, by no means you may enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

21. You have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou kill; who ever shall kill, liable shall be to the tribunal.

22. I but say to you, that all the being angry to the brother of him, without cause, liable shall be to the tribunal: who and ever shall say to the brother of him, Vile fellow, liable shall be to the Sanhedrim; who and ever shall say: O fool, liable shall be to the Gehenna of the fire.

23. If therefore thou bring the gift of thee of the altar and there remember, that the brother of thee has somewhat against thee,

24. leave there the gift of thee before the altar, and go, first be thou reconciled to the brother of thee, and then coming offer the gift of thee.

25. Be thou willing to agree with the opponent of thee quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest thee deliver up the opponent to the judge, and judge thee deliver up to the officer, and into prison thou shalt be cast.

26. Indeed I say to thee, by no means thou wilt come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.

27. You have heard, that it was said: Not thou shalt commit adultery.

28. I but say to you, that all who looking at a woman in order to lust after her, already has debauched her in the heart of him.

29. If and the eye of thee the right ensnare thee, tear out it, and cast it from thee, it is profitable for to thee, that should perish one of the members of thee, and not whole the body her, and cast from thee;

30. it is profitable for the right of thee hand ensnare thee, cut off her, and cast from thee; it is profitable for to thee that should perish one of the members of thee, and not whole the body of thee should be cast into Gehenna.

31. It was said and: that whoever shall release the wife of him, let him give her a bill of divorce.

32. I but say to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except on account of fornication, makes her to commit adultery; and whoever her being divorced, may marry, commits adultery.

33. Again you have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou shall swear falsely; shalt perform but to the Lord the oaths of thee.

34. I but say to you not swear at all; not even by the heaven, for a throne it is of the God;

35. nor by the earth, for a footstool it is of the feet of him; neither by Jerusalem, for a city it is of the great king;

36. nor by the head of thee shalt thou swear, for not thou art able one hair white or black to make.

37. Let be but the word of you; yes yes; no no; that for over and above of these, of the evil is.

38. You have heard, that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

39. I but say to you, not resist the evil; but whoever thee shall slap upon the right of thee cheek, turn to him also the other;

40. and to the purposing thee to sue at law, and the tunic of thee to take, give up to him also the mantle;

41. and whoever thee shall force to go mile one, go with him two.

42. To the asking thee do thou give; and the wishing from thee to borrow money, not do thou repulse.

43. You have heard, that it was said: Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee, and hate the enemy of thee.

44. I but say to you, love the enemies of you, bless those cursing you, good do to those hating you and pray for those injuring you and persecuting you;

45. that you may be sons of the Father of you, of the in heavens; for the sun of him it rises on evil and good, and it rains on just and unjust.

46. If for you love those loving you, what reward have you? not even the taxgatherers the same to do?

47. and if you salute the brothers of you only, what more do you? not even the Gentiles so do?

48. Shall be therefore you perfect, as the Father of you, who in the heavens, perfect is.

## Matthew 6

1. Take heed the righteousness of you not to do in the presence of the men, so as to be exhibited to them; if but otherwise, reward not you have with to the Father of you, to the in the heavens.

2. When then thou doest alms, not sound a trumpet in the presence of thee, like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have praise of the men. Indeed I say to you, they obtain the reward of them.

3. Of thee but doing alms giving, not let it know the left of thee, what does the right of thee,

4. that maybe of thee the alms giving in the secret; and the Father of thee, who seeing in the secret, himself will give back to thee.

5. And when thou prayest, not thou shalt be like the hypocrites; for they love in the synagogues and Matthew in the corners of the wide places standing to pray, that they may appear to the men. Indeed I say to you, that they have in full the reward of them.

6. Thou but, when thou prayest, enter into the retired place of thee, and locking the door of thee, pray thou to the Father of thee, to the in the secret; and the Father of thee, who seeing in the secret place, will give to thee in the clearlight.

7. Praying but not babble, like the Gentiles; they imagine for that in the wordiness of them they shall be heard.

8. Not therefore you may be like to them; knows for the Father of you, of what things need you have, before of the you ask him.

9. In this way then pray you: Father with us, who in the heavens, reverenced the name of thee;

10. let come the kingdom of thee; let be done the will of thee, as in heaven, also on the earth;

11. the bread of us the sufficient give thou to us today;

12. and discharge to us the debts of us, as even we discharge to the debtors of us

13. and not bring us into temptation, but save us from the evil.

14. If for you forgive to the men the faults of them, will forgive also you the Father of you the heavenly;

15. if but not forgive to the men the faults of them, neither the Father of you will forgive the faults of you.

16. When and you fast, not be, like the hypocrites, of a sad face; they disfigure for the faces of them; so that they may seem to the men to be fasting. Indeed I say to you, that they obtain the reward of them.

17. Thou but fasting anoint of thee the head, and the face of thee wash,

18. so that not thou mayest seem to the men fasting, but to the Father of thee, that in the secret; and the Father of thee, who seeing in the secret, will give to thee.

19. Not lay up to you treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroys, and where thieves dig through and steal;

20. lay up but to you treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves not dig through nor steal.

21. Where for is the treasure of you, there will be also and the heart of you.

22. The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore the eye of thee sound may be, whole the body of thee enlightened will be.

23. If but the eye of thee evil may be, whole the body of thee darkness will be. If then the light; that in thee, darkness is, the darkness how great?

24. No one is able two lords to serve; either for the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or one he will cling to, and the other he will slight. Not you are able God to serve and mammon.

25. For this I say to you: Not be over careful the life of you, what you may eat, and what you may drink; nor to the body of you, what you may put on. Not the life more is the food, and the body the clothing?

26. Look attentively at the birds of the heaven, for not they sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and the Father of you the heavenly feeds them. Not you greatly excel them?

27. Which and by of you being over careful is able to add to the age of him span one?

28. And about clothing why be over careful? Consider the lilies of the field how it grows; not it labors, nor spins;

29. I say but to you, that not even Solomon in all the glory of him was clothed like one of these.

30. If then the grass of the field, today existing and tomorrow into an oven is being cast, the God so clothes, not much more you, O you of weak faith?

31. Not therefore you may be over careful, saying: What may we eat, or what may we drink, or what may we put on?

32. All for these the Gentiles seeks; knows for the Father of you the heavenly, that you have need of these all.

33. Seek you but first the kingdom of the God and the righteousness of him, and these all shall be superadded to you.

34. Not therefore be over careful for the morrow; the for morrow will be over careful of the herself. Enough to the day the trouble of her.

## Matthew 7

1. Not do you judge, that not you may be judged.

2. In what for judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and in what measure you measure, it shall measured to you.

3. Why and seest thou the splinter, that in the eye of the brother of thee, that but in thineown eye beam not perceivest?

4. or how will thou say to the brother of thee: Allow me, I can pull the splinter from the eye of thee; and lo, the beam in the eye of thee?

5. O hypocrite, pull first the beam out of the eye of thee, and then thou shalt see clearly to pull the splinter out of the eye of the brother of thee.

6. Not you may give the holy to the dogs, neither cast the pearls of you before the swine; lest they should trample them under the feet of them, and turning they should rend you.

7. Ask, and it shall be given to you; and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.

8. All for the asking receives; and the seeking finds; and to the knocking it shall be opened.

9. Or what is there of you a man, who if ask the son of him bread, not a stone will give to him?

10. or if a fish he asks, not a serpent will give to him?

11. If then you, bad ones being, know gifts good to give to the children of you, how much more the Father of you, that in the heavens, give good to those asking him?

12. All therefore, as much so ever you may will that should do to you the men, even so also you do to them; this for is the law and the prophets.

13. Enter you in through the strait gate; for wide the gate, and broad the road that leading into the perdition; and many are those entering through her.

14. How strait the gate, and difficult the road that leading into the life; and few are they finding her.

15. Beware ye and of the false prophets, who come to you in clothing of sheep, within but they are wolves ravenous.

16. By the fruits of them you shall know them. What do they gather from thorns a cluster of grapes, or from thistles figs?

17. So every tree good fruits good bears; the but corrupt tree fruits evil bears.

18. Not is possible tree good fruits evil to bear, neither tree corrupt fruits good to bear.

19. Every tree, not bearing fruit good, is cut down and into a fire is cast.

20. Therefore by the fruits of them you shall know them.

21. Not all who saying to me; O Lord, O Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but he doing the will of the Father of me, of that in heavens.

22. Many shall say to me in that the day; O Lord, O Lord, not to the thy name have we prophesied, and to the thy name demons have we cast out, and to the thy name wonders many have we done?

23. And then I will declare to them; Because never knew you; depart from me those working the lawlessness.

24. All therefore whoever hears of me the words these, and does them, I will compare him to a man prudent, who will built the house of him upon the rock;

25. and fell down the rain, and came the floods, and blew the winds, and beat against the house that; and not it fell; it was founded for on the rock.

26. And all who hearing of me the words these and not doing them, shall be compared to a man foolish, who built the house of him upon sand;

27. and fell down the rain, and came the floods, and blew the winds, and dashed against the house that, and it fell; and was the fall her great.

28. And it came to pass, when had finished the Jesus the words these, were astounded the crowds at the teaching of him.

29. He was for teaching them as authority having, and not as the scribes.

## Matthew 8

1. Coming down and to him from the mountain, followed after him crowds great.

2. And lo, a leper coming prostrated to him, saying: O sir, if thou wilt, thou art able me to cleanse.

3. And putting forth the hand, he touched him the Jesus, saying: I will, be thou cleaned. And immediately was cleaned of him the leprosy.

4. And says to him the Jesus: See no one thou tell; but go, thyself show to the priest, and offer the gift, which commanded Moses, for a witness to them.

5. Having entered and to him into Capernaum, came to him a centurion, addressing him,

6. and saying: O sir, the boy of me is laid in the house a paralytic, greatly being afflicted.

7. And says to him the Jesus: I coming will heal him.

8. And answering the centurion said: O sir, not I am fit that of me under the the roof thou shouldst enter; but only speak a word, and will be healed the boy of me.

9. Even for I am a man am under authority, having under myself soldiers; and I say to this: Go, and he goes; and to another; Come, and he comes; and to the slave of me; Do this, and he does.

10. Hearing and the Jesus, was astonished, and said to those following: Indeed I say to you, not even in the Israel so great faith I have found.

11. I say but to you, that many from east and west will come, and will lie down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.

12. The but sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the darkness the outer; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

13. And said the Jesus to the centurion: Go and as thou hast believed let it be done to thee. And was healed the boy of him in the hour that.

14. And coming the Jesus into the house of Peter, saw the motherinlaw of him being laid down and burning with fever.

15. And he touched the hand of her, and left her the fever; and arose, and ministered to them.

16. Evening now being come, they brought to him being possessed many; and he cast out the spirits by a word, and all those sickness having he healed;

17. that might be fulfilled the words spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying: Himself the weakness of us he took away, and the diseases he removed.

18. Seeing and the Jesus great multitudes about him, he gave orders to depart to the other side.

19. And coming one scribe, said to him: O teacher, I will follow thee, where ever thou goest.

20. And says to him the Jesus: The foxes dens they have, and the birds of the heaven nests; the but son of the man not he has, where the head he may rest.

21. Another and of the disciples of him said to him: O master, permit thou me first to go, and to bury the father of me.

22. The but Jesus said to him: Follow me, and leave the dead ones to bury the of themselves dead ones.

23. And entering to him into the ship, followed to him the disciples of him.

24. And lo, a commotion great arose in the sea, so as the ship to cover by the waves; he but was asleep.

25. And coming the disciples awoke him, saying: O master, do thou save us we perish.

26. And he says to them: How timid you are, O you of weak faith? Then arising he rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a calm great.

27. The and men were astonished, saying: What is this, that even the winds and the sea hearken to him?

28. And coming to him to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, met him two being demonized, out of the sepulchres coming forth, fierce very, so that not to be able any one to pass along by the way that.

29. And lo, they cried out saying: What to us and to thee, O son of the God? Comest thou there before a destined time to torment us?

30. There was now at some distance from them a herd of swine many feeding.

31. The and demons implored him, saying: If thou cast out us, send us to the herd of the swine.

32. And he said to them: Go. They and coming out they went to the swine. And lo, rushed whole the herd down the steep place into the lake, and died in the waters.

33. They and feeding them fled, and arriving at the city, related all, and that of those being demonized.

34. And lo, whole the city went out to a meeting to the Jesus; and seeing him, they entreated, that he would depart from the coast of them.

## Matthew 9

1. And stepping into the boat, he passed over, and came to the own city.

2. And lo, they brought to him, a paralytic, upon a bed lying. And seeing the Jesus the faith of them, he said to the paralytic: Take courage, son; are forgiven thee the sins of thee.

3. And lo, some of the scribes said among themselves: This blasphemes.

4. And knowing the Jesus the thoughts of them, says: Why you think evils in the hearts of you?

5. Which for is easier? to say: Are forgiven of thee the sins? or to say: Arise and walk?

6. That but you may know that authority has the son of the man on the earth to forgive sins; (then he says to the paralytic:) Arising take up of thee the bed, and go into the house of thee.

7. And arising he went to the house of him.

8. Seeing and the crowds wondered, and glorified the God, that having given authority so great to the men.

9. And passing on the Jesus from thence, he saw a man sitting at the customhouse, Matthew being named; and he says to him: Follow me. And rising up he followed him.

10. And it happened, of him reclining at table in the house, and lo, many publicans and sinners coming reclined with the Jesus and the disciples of him.

11. And seeing the Pharisees said to the disciples of him: Why with the publicans and sinners eats the teacher of you?

12. The Jesus hearing, says to them: No need have those being well of a physician, but those sick being.

13. You are going but learn, what is; Mercy I wish, and not a sacrifice. Not for I am come to call just persons, but sinners.

14. Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why we and the Pharisees fast much, the but disciples of thee not fast?

15. And says to them the Jesus: Not are able the sons of the bridal chamber to mourn, in as much with them is the bridegroom? Shall come but days, when may be taken from them the bridegroom, and then they shall fast.

16. No one now puts a patch of cloth unfulled on to a mantle old; takes away for the patch of it from the mantle, and worse a rent becomes.

17. Nor do they put wine new into bottles old; if but not, burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are destroyed; but they put wine new into bottles new, and both are preserved together.

18. These of him speaking, of them, lo, a ruler certain coming prostrated to him, saying: That the daughter of me now is dead; but coming lay the hand of thee upon her, and she shall live.

19. And arising the Jesus went after him, and the disciples of him.

20. And lo, a woman having a flow of blood twelve years, approaching behind, touched the tuft of the mantle of him.

21. She said for within herself: If only I can touch the mantle of him, I shall be healed.

22. The but Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Take courage, daughter; the faith of thee has saved thee. And she was well the woman from the hour of that.

23. And coming the Jesus into the house of a ruler, and seeing the fluteplayers, and the crowd making noise,

24. says to them: Withdraw; not for is dead the girl, but sleeps. And they derided him.

25. When but they put out the crowd, he entering took hold of the hand of her; and was raised the girl.

26. And went forth the report this into all the land that.

27. And passing on from there the Jesus, went after him two blind men, crying out and saying: Have pity on us, O son of David.

28. Being come and into the house, came to him the blind men, and says to them the Jesus: Do you believe, that I am able this I do? They say to him: Yes O master.

29. Then he touched the eyes of them, saying: According to the faith of you be it done to you.

30. And were opened of them the eyes. And strictly charged them the Jesus, saying: See, no one knows.

31. They but having gone published him in all the land that.

32. These and going away, lo, they brought to him a man dumb, being demonized.

33. And having cast out the demon, spoke the dumb. And were astonished the crowds, saying: Never was it seen thus in to the Israel.

34. The but Pharisees said: By the prince of the demons he cast out the demons.

35. And went about the Jesus the cities all and the villages, teaching in the synagogues of them, and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every malady.

36. Seeing and the crowds, he moved with pity for them, because they were jaded and scattered, like sheep not having a shepherd.

37. Then he says to the disciples of him: The indeed harvest plenteous, the but laborers few.

38. Implore then the Lord of the harvest, that he would send out laborers into the harvest of him.

## Matthew 10

1. And having called the twelve disciples of him, he gave to them authority spirits unclean, so as to cast out them, and to heal every disease and every malady.

2. Of the now twelve apostles the names are these: First, Simon that being called Peter, and Andrew the brother of him; James that of the Zebedee, and John the brother of him;

3. Phillip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the taxgatherer; James that of the Alpheus, and Lebbeus the surnamed Thaddeus;

4. Simon the Canaanite, and Judas that Iscariot, who even delivered up him.

5. These the twelve sent forth the Jesus, commanding them, saying: Into a road of Gentiles not you may go, and into a city of Samaritans not you may enter.

6. Go you but rather to the sheep the perishing house of Israel.

7. Passing on your way and preach you, saying: That has come nigh the kingdom of the heavens.

8. Those being sick heal, dead ones raise up, lepers cleanse, demons cast out; freely you have received, freely give.

9. Not provide gold, nor silver, nor copper in the belts of you;

10. not a bag for a journey nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff. Worthy for the laborer of the food of him is.

11. Into what and ever city or countrytown you may enter, search out, who in her worthy is; and there abide, till you go thence.

12. Entering and into the house, salute her.

13. And if indeed may be the house worthy, let come the peace of you on her; If but not may be worthy, the peace of you to you let it turn.

14. And who if not may receive you, nor hear the words of you, coming out of the house or of the city that, shake off the dust of the feet of you.

15. Indeed I say to you, more tolerable will be land of Sodom and Gomorrah in a day of trial, than the city that.

16. Lo, I send you as sheep in midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as the serpents, and artless as the doves.

17. Take heed and of the men. They will hand over for you to sanhedrims, and in the synagogues of them they shall scourge you;

18. and before governors and also kings you shall be led on account of me, for a witness to them and to the nations.

19. When but they shall deliver up you, not you may be anxious, how or what you must speak; it shall be given for to you in that the hour, what you shall speak.

20. Not for you are the speaking, but the spirit of the Father of you, that is speaking in you.

21. Will give up and a brother a brother to death them; and you will be being hated by rise up children against parents, and deliver to death them;

22. and you will be being hated by all for the name of me. The but persevering to end, the same shall be saved.

23. When but they persecute you in the city this, flee into the other; and if out of this they persecute you, flee into the other. Indeed for I say to you, in no wise you may finish the cities of the Israel, till may come the son of the man.

24. Not is a disciple above the teacher, nor a slave above the lord of him.

25. Sufficient to the disciple that he be as the teacher of him, and the slave as the lord of him. If the master of the house Beelzebul they have named, how much more the domestics of him?

26. Not therefore you may fear them. Nothing for is having been covered, which not shall be uncovered; and secret, which not shall be known.

27. What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what in the ear you hear, preach you on the housetops.

28. And not be afraid of those killing the body, the but life not being able to kill; be afraid but rather that being able both life and body to destroy in Gehenna.

29. Not two sparrows an assarius are sold? and one of them not shall fall upon the earth without the Father of you.

30. Of you and even the hairs of the head all being numbered are.

31. Not therefore fear you; many sparrows are better you.

32. All therefore whoever shall confess to me in presence of the men, I will confess even I to him in presence of the Father of me, of that in heavens.

33. Whoever but if may deny me in presence of the men, I will deny him even I in presence of the Father of me, of that in heavens.

34. Not must you suppose that I am come to send peace upon the earth; not I am come to send peace, but a sword.

35. I am come for to set a man against the father of him, and a daughter against the mother of her, and a daughterinlaw against the motherinlaw of her;

36. and enemies of the man, the household of him.

37. He loving father or mother above me, not is of me worthy; and he loving son or daughter above me, not is of me worthy;

38. and who not takes the cross of himself, and follows after me, not is of me worthy.

39. He finding the life of himself, shall lose her; and he having lost the life of himself on account of me, shall find her.

40. He receiving you, me receives; and he me receiving, receives him sending me.

41. He receiving a prophet in a name of a prophet, a reward of a prophet shall obtain; and he receiving a just man in a name of a just man, a reward of a just man shall obtain.

42. And who ever may give to one of the littleones these a cup of cold only, in a name of a disciple, indeed I say to you, not not may lose the reward of himself.

## Matthew 11

1. And it happened, when has finished the Jesus charging to the twelve disciples of himself, he departed thence, of the to teach and to preach in the cities of them.

2. The and John having heard in the prison the works of the Anointed, having sent two of the disciples of himself,

3. said to him: Thou art the coming one, or another are we to look for?

4. And answering the Jesus said to them: Going away relate to John what you hear and see;

5. blind ones see again, and lame ones are walking about, lepers are cleansed, and deaf ones are hearing, dead ones are raised up, and poor ones are addressed with joyful news;

6. and blessed is, whoever not may offended in me.

7. These and going away, began the Jesus to say to the crowds concerning John: What went you out in the desert to see? a reed by wind being shaken?

8. But what went you out to see? a man in soft garments having been clothed? Lo, those the soft (garments) wearing, in the houses of the kings are.

9. But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more of a prophet.

10. This for is, concerning whom it is written: Lo, I send the messenger of me before the face thee, who shall prepare the way of thee in presence of thee.

11. Indeed I say to you, not has risen among born of woman greater, of John the dipper; the but less in the kingdom of the heavens, greater of him is.

12. From and the days of John the dipper till now, the kingdom of the heavens has been invaded, and invaders seize on her.

13. All for the prophets and the law till John, prophesied.

14. And if you are willing to receive, this is Elias, that being about to come.

15. He having ears to hear let him hear.

16. To what but shall I compare the generation this? Like it is boys in markets sitting, and calling to the companions of them,

17. and saying: We have played on the flute to you, and not you have danced; We have mourned to you, and not you have lamented.

18. Came for John, neither eating nor drinking; and they say: A demon he has.

19. Came the son of the man, eating and drinking; and they say: Lo, a man glutton and a wine drinker, of taxgatherers a friend and sinners. But is justified the wisdom by the children of her.

20. Then he began to reproach the cities, in which were done the most mighty works of him, because not they reformed;

21. Woe to thee, Chorazin, Woe to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works, those being performed in you, long ago would in sackcloth and ashes they have reformed.

22. But I say to you: Tyre and Sidon more tolerable will be in a day of trial, than you.

23. And thou, Capernaum, which even to the heaven art being exalted, to invisibility shalt be brought down; for if in Sodom had been done the mighty works, those being done in thee, it had remained till this day.

24. But I say to you, that land of Sodom more tolerable will be in a day of trial, then thee.

25. On that the occasion answering the Jesus said: I adore thee, O Father, O Lord the heaven and of the earth, because thou hast hid these from wise men and discerning men, and thou hast revealed them to babes.

26. Yes, the Father, for even so it was good in presence of thee.

27. All to me are given by the Father of me; and no one knows the son, if not the Father; neither the Father any one knows, if not the son, and to whom may be willing the son to reveal.

28. Come to me all the toiling and being burdened, and I will cause to rest you.

29. Take the yoke of me upon you, and be informed by me; for meek I am, and humble to the heart and you shall find a rest to the lives of you.

30. The for yoke of me easy, and the burden of me light is.

## Matthew 12

1. At that the season passed the Jesus to the sabbaths through the cornfields; the and disciples of him were hungry, and began to pluck ears of corn, and to eat.

2. The and Pharisees seeing, said to him: Lo, the disciples of thee are doing, that is not lawful to do in a sabbath.

3. He but said to them: Not have you known, what did David, when he was hungry, and those with him?

4. how he entered in the house of the God, and the loaves of the presence did eat, which not lawful was to him to eat, neither to those with him, except the priests alone?

5. Or not have you read in the law, that to the sabbaths the priests in the temple the sabbath violate, and blameless are?

6. I say but to you, that of the temple greater is here.

7. If but you had known, what is; Mercy I desire, and not a sacrifice; not would you have condemned the blameless.

8. A lord for is of the sabbath the son of the man.

9. And passing on from thence, he came into the synagogue of them.

10. And lo, a man there was the hand having withered. And they asked him, saying: If it is lawful to the sabbaths to heal? that they might accuse him.

11. He but said to them: What shall be among you a man, who shall have sheep one, and if should fall this to the sabbath into a pit, not seize it, and raise it up?

12. How much then is superior a man of a sheep? So that it is lawful to the sabbath good to do.

13. Then he says to the man: Stretch out the hand of thee. And he stretched it out; and it was restored whole, as the other.

14. The then Pharisees a council held against him going out, how him they might destroy.

15. The but Jesus knowing withdrew from thence; and followed him crowds great; and he healed them all,

16. and charged them that not known him they should make;

17. so that it might be fulfilled the word spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying:

18. Lo, the servant of me, whom I have chosen, the beloved of me, in whom takes delight the soul of me: I will put the spirit of me upon him, and judgment to the nations he shall declare.

19. Not he shall strive, nor cry out, nor shall hear any one in the wide places the voice of him;

20. a reed having been bruised not he shall break, and flax smoking not shall quench; till he bring forth to a victory the judgment.

21. And to the name of him nations will hope.

22. Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both to speak and to see.

23. And were amazed all the crowds, and said: Not this is the son of David?

24. The and Pharisees hearing, said: This not casts out the demons, if not by the Beelzebul, a prince of the demons.

25. Knowing but the Jesus the thoughts of them, said to them: Every kingdom being divided against itself, is laid waste; and every city or house being divided against itself, not will stand.

26. And if the adversary the adversary casts out, with himself he is at variance; how then will stand the kingdom of him?

27. And if I by Beelzebul cast out the demons, the sons of you by whom do they cast out? In this they of you shall be judges.

28. If but by spirit of God I cast out the demons, then has suddenly come among you the majesty of the God.

29. Or how is able any one to enter into the house of the strong man, and the household stuff of him to plunder, if not first he should bind the strong man? and then the house of him he shall plunder.

30. He not being with me, against me is; and he not gathering with me, scatters.

31. Therefore this I say to you: All sin and evilspeaking shall be forgiven to the men; the but of the spirit evilspeaking not shall be forgiven to the men;

32. and who ever may speak a word against of the son of the man, it shall be forgiven to him; who but ever may speak against of the spirit of the holy, not it shall be forgiven to him, neither in this the age, nor in the coming.

33. Either make you the tree good, and the fruits of him good; or make you the tree corrupt, and the fruits of him corrupt; by for the fruit the tree is known.

34. O broods of venomous serpents, how are you able good (things) to speak, evil (men) being? out of for the fulness of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. The good man out of the good treasure bring forth the good (things); and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil (things).

36. I say but to you, that every word idle, which if may speak the men, they shall give account, concerning this word in a day of trial.

37. By for the words of thee thou shalt be acquitted, and by the words of thee thou shalt be condemned.

38. Then answered some of the scribes and Pharisees, saying: O teacher, we wish from thee a sign to see.

39. He but answering said to them: A generation evil and adulterous a sign demands; and a sign not shall be given to her, if not a sign of Jonas the prophet.

40. Like as for was Jonas in the belly of the fish three days and three nights; so shall be the son of the man in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.

41. Men Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment against the generation of this, and shall give judgment against her; for they reformed at the preaching of Jonas; and lo, a greater of Jonas here.

42. Queen of south shall rise up in the judgment against the generation of this, and shall give judgment against her; for she came from the ends of the earth to her the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, a greater of Solomon here.

43. When but the unclean spirit may come out from the man, it wanders about through dry places seeking a restingplace, and not it finds.

44. Then it says: I will return into the house of me, whence I came. And coming it finds it being empty, having been swept, and having been set in order.

45. Then it goes, and takes with itself seven other spirits, more wicked of itself, and they entering finds an abode there; and becomes the last (state) of the man that worse of the first. Thus will be and the generation this the wicked.

46. While and he is talking to the crowds, lo, the mother and the brothers of him stood without, seeking to him to speak.

47. Said then one to him: Lo, the mother of thee and the brothers of thee without stand, seeking to thee to speak.

48. He but answering said to the man informing him: Who is the mother of me? and who are the brothers of me?

49. And stretching out the hand of him towards the disciples of him, said: Lo, the mother of me, and the brothers of me.

50. Whoever for may do the will of the Father of me, that in heavens, the same of me a brother and a sister and a mother is.

## Matthew 13

1. In but the day that departing the Jesus from the house, he sat by the sea;

2. and were gathered to him crowds great, so that he into the ship entering to be seated; and all the crowds on the shore stood.

3. And he spake to them much in parables, saying: Lo, went out the sower of the (seed) to sow.

4. And in the sowing it, some indeed fell on the path; and came the birds, and ate them.

5. Others and fell on the rocky ground where not it had earth much; and immediately sprung up, through the not to have a depth of earth;

6. sun and having arisen, it was scorched; and through the not have a root, was dried up.

7. Others and fell among the thorns; and sprung up the thorns, and coked them.

8. Others and fell on the ground the good; and bore fruit, the one a hundred, the other sixty, the other thirty.

9. He having ear to hear, let him hear.

10. And coming the disciples said to him: Why in parables speakest thou to them?

11. He and answering said to the: Because to you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of the heavens; to them but not it is given.

12. Whoever for has, it shall be given to him, and he will be gifted with abundance; Whoever but not has, even what he has, shall be taken from him.

13. Therefore this in parables to them I speak, for seeing not they see, and hearing not they hear, neither do they understand.

14. And is fulfilled to them the prophecy of Esaias, that saying: By hearing you shall hear, and not not may you understand; and seeing you will see, and not not you may see.

15. Has grown fat for the heart of the people this, and with the ears heavily they hear, and the eyes of them they shut, lest they should see with the eyes, and with the ears they should hear, and with the heart should understand, and they should turn, and I should heal them.

16. Of you but blessed the eyes for they see; and the ears of you for they hear.

17. Indeed for I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see, what you see, and not saw; and to hear, what you hear, and not heard.

18. You therefore hear the parable of the sower.

19. Any one hearing the word of the kingdom, and not understanding, comes the wicked (one), and snatches that having been sown in the heart of him; this is, that on the path being sown.

20. That but on the rocky ground being sown, this, who the word hearing and forthwith with joy receiving it;

21. not he has but a root in himself, but transient is; arising and trial or persecution through the word, immediately he is offended.

22. That but into the thorns being sown, this is, who the word hearing, and the care of the age this, and the delusion of the riches chokes the word; and unfruitful becomes.

23. That but on the ground the good being sown, this is, who the word hearing, and understanding; who really bear fruit, and yields, the one a hundred, the other sixty, the other thirty.

24. Another parable he proposed to them, saying: May be compared the kingdom of the heavens to a man sowing good seed in the field of him.

25. In and the to sleep the men, came of him the enemy, and sowed darnel through midst of the wheat; and went forth.

26. When and was spring up the blade and fruit yielded, then appeared also the darnel.

27. Coming and the slaves of the householder, said to him: O lord, not good seed didst thou sow in the thy field? whence then has it darnel?

28. He and said to them: An enemy a man this has done. The and slaves said to him: Dost thou wish then going forth we should gather them?

29. He said: No; lest, gathering the darnel, you should root up with them the wheat.

30. Leave them to grow together both till the harvest; and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvesters: Gather you first the darnel, and bind you them into bundles, for the to burn them; the but wheat bring together into the barn of me.

31. Another parable he proposed to them, saying: Like is the kingdom of the heavens to a grain of mustard, which taking a man sowed in the field of him.

32. Which less indeed is of all of the seeds; when but it may be grown, greater of the herbs is, and becomes a tree, so that to come the birds of the heaven, and to make nests in the branches of it.

33. Another parable he spake to them: Like is the kingdom of the heavens to leaven, which taking a woman mixed in of meal measures three, till of it was leavened whole.

34. These all spake the Jesus in parables to the crowds, and without a parable not he spake to them;

35. so that it might be fulfilled the word spoken through the prophet, say: I will open in parables the mouth of me; I will openly declare things having been hid from a beginning of the world.

36. Then leaving the crowds, went into the house the Jesus. And came to him the disciples of him, saying: Explain to us the parable of darnels of the field.

37. He and answering said to them: He sowing the good seed, is the son of the man;

38. the and field, is the world; the and good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom; the and darnel, are the sons of the wicked (one);

39. the and enemy, he having sown them, is the adversary; the and harvest, end of the age is; the and reapers, messengers are.

40. As therefore are gathered the darnel, and in a fire are burned; so will it he in the end of the age this.

41. Will send the son of the man the messengers of him, and they will gather out of the kingdom of him all the seducers and those working the lawlessness,

42. and they will cast them into the furnace of the fire; there shall be a weeping and gnashing of the teeth.

43. Then the righteous shall shine, as the sun, in the kingdom of the father of them. He having ears to hear, let him hear.

44. Again like is the kingdom of the heaven to a treasure having been hid in the field, which finding a man be hides, and from the joy of him he goes, and all as much he has sells, and buys the field that.

45. Again like is the kingdom of the heaven to a man a merchant, seeking choice pearls.

46. Finding and one costly pearl, going he sold all as much as he had, and bought it.

47. Again like is the kingdom of the heaven, to a dragnet, being cast into the sea, and of every kind bringing together;

48. which when it is full, drawing to the shore, and sitting down they collected the good into vessels, the but bad away they cast.

49. So it will be in the end of the age. Shall go forth the messengers, and shall separate the wicked from among the just,

50. and shall cast them into the furnace of the fire; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

51. Says to them the Jesus: Have you understood these things all? They say to him: Yes O Lord.

52. He then said to them: Therefore this every scribe, being instructed to the kingdom of the heavens, like is to a man an householder, who brings out of the treasury of him new and old.

53. And it came to pass, when had concluded the Jesus the parables these, he departed thence.

54. And coming into the country of him, he taught them in the synagogue of them, so as to astonish them, and to say, Whence this the wisdom this, and these powers?

55. Not this is the of the carpenter son? Not the mother of him is called Mary? and the brothers of him James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

56. and the sisters of him not all with us are? whence then this these all?

57. And they found a difficulty in him. The and Jesus said to them: Not is a prophet unhonored, if not in the country of him, and in the house of him.

58. And not he did do there mighty works many, because of the unbelief of them.

## Matthew 14

1. At that the time heard Herod the tetrarch the fame of Jesus,

2. and said to the servants of him: This is the John the dipper; he is raised from the dead, and therefore this the mighty powers work in him.

3. The for Herod, seizing the John, had bound him, and put in prison, on account of Herodias the wife of Philip the brother of him.

4. He said for to him the John: Not it is lawful to thee to have her.

5. And wishing him to destroy, he feared the people, for as a prophet him they esteemed.

6. Birthday of but was being held of the Herod, danced the daughter of Herodias in the midst; and pleased the Herod;

7. whereupon with an oath he promised to her to give, what soever she might ask.

8. She and, being incited by the mother of her, Give to me, she said, here upon a plate the head of John the dipper.

9. And was sorry the king; because of but the oaths and those reclining at table, he commanded it to be given.

10. And sending he cut off the head of the John in the prison.

11. And was brought the head of him on a plate, and it was given to the little girl; and she brought it to the mother of her.

12. And coming the disciples of him took the body, and they buried it; and departing they told it to the Jesus.

13. And having heard the Jesus, withdrew from thence in a ship into a desert place by himself; and having heard the crowds, they followed him by land from the cities.

14. And coming out the Jesus saw great a crowd; and he was moved with pity towards them, and healed the sick of them.

15. Evening and having come, came to him the disciples of him, saying: A desert is the place, and the hour has passed by; dismiss the crowds, that going into the villages, they may buy themselves victuals.

16. The but Jesus said to them: No need they have to go away; give to them you to eat.

17. They and say to him: Not we have here, except five loaves and two fishes,

18. He and said: Bring to me them here.

19. And directing the crowds to recline upon the grass, taking the five loaves, and the two fishes, looking up to the heaven, he gave praise; and breaking, he gave to the disciples the loaves, the and disciples to the crowds.

20. And they ate all, and were filled; and they took up the over and above of the fragments, twelve baskets full.

21. Those and eating were men about fivethousand, besides women and children.

22. And immediately he urged the disciples to enter into the ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he should dismiss the crowds.

23. And having sent away the crowds, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. Evening and having come, alone he was there.

24. The and ship now in the midst of the sea was, having been tossed by the waves; was for contrary the wind.

25. In forth and watch of the night he went to them, walking upon the sea.

26. And seeing him the disciples upon the sea walking, they were terrified, saying: That an apparition is; and from the fear they cried aloud.

27. Immediately but spake to them the Jesus, saying: Take courage, I am; not be afraid.

28. Answering and him the Peter said: O lord, if thou art, bid me to thee to come upon the water.

29. He and said: Come. And descending from the boat the Peter, he walked upon the water, to come to the Jesus.

30. Seeing but the wind strong, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying: O lord, save me.

31. Immediately and the Jesus stretching out the hand, took hold of him, and says to him: O distrustful man, for why didst thou doubt?

32. And entering of them into the ship, ceased the wind.

33. They and in the ship, coming prostrated to him saying: Certainly of a God a son thou art.

34. And having passed over, they came to the land Gennesaret.

35. And knowing him the men of the place that, they send into all the country round about that, and they brought to him all those disease having,

36. and besought him that only they might touch the tuft of the mantle of him; and as many as touched, were made whole.

## Matthew 15

1. Then came to the Jesus those from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:

2. Why the disciples of thee transgress the tradition of the elders? not for they wash the hands of them, whenever bread they may eat.

3. He but answering said to them: Why also you transgress the commandment of the God, through the tradition of you?

4. He for God he commanded, saying: Honor the father and the mother; and: He reviling father or mother, death let him die.

5. You but say: Whoever may say to the father or the mother, A gift, whatever out of me thou mightest be profited;

6. then not not may honor the father of him or the mother of him. And you annul the commandment of the God through the tradition of you.

7. O hypocrites, well prophesied concerning you Esaias, saying:

8. The people this with the lips me honor; the but heart of them far off is removed from me.

9. without profit but they reverence me, teaching doctrine, commandments of men.

10. And having called the crowd, he said to them: Hear you and be instructed.

11. Not that entering into the mouth pollutes the man; but that proceeding out of the mouth this pollutes the man.

12. Then having come the disciples of him, said to him: Knowest thou, that the Pharisees, hearing that saying, found a difficulty?

13. He but answering said: Every plantation, which not has planted the Father of me the heavenly, shall be rooted up.

14. Let alone them; guides they are blind of blind. Blind and blind if may lead, both into a pit will fall.

15. Answering and the Peter said to him: Explain to us the comparison this.

16. The and Jesus said: Yet also you unintelligent are?

17. Not yet perceive you, that all that entering into the mouth, into the belly passes, and into a privy is cast?

18. Those but proceeding out of the mouth, from the heart issues forth, and they pollute the man.

19. From for the heart comes forth purposes evil; murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, evil speakers.

20. These is the (things) polluting the man; that but with unwashed hands to eat not pollutes the man.

21. And departing thence the Jesus withdrew into the confines of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And lo, a woman Canaanitish, of the parts those coming out, cried out to him, saying: Pity me, O lord, O son David; the daughter of me sadly is demonized.

23. He but not answered her a word. And coming the disciples of him, besought him, saying: Send away her, for she cries at the back of us.

24. He but answering said: Not I am sent, except to the sheep the perishing house of Israel.

25. She then coming prostrated to him, saying: O lord, give aid to me.

26. He but answering said: Not it is right to take the bread of the children, and to throw to the dogs.

27. She but said: True, O Lord: even for the dogs eatest of the crumbs of the falling from the table of the masters of them.

28. Then answering the Jesus and to her: O woman, great of thee the faith; let it be to thee, as thou wilt. And was healed the daughter of her from the hour that.

29. And departing thence the Jesus, came near the sea the Galilee; and ascending into the mountain, he sat down there.

30. And came to him crowds great, having with them lame, blind, deaf, maimed, and others many; and they laid them at the feet of the Jesus, and he healed them;

31. so that the crowds to wonder, beholding deaf speaking, maimed sound, lame walking and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.

32. The then Jesus, having called the disciples of him, said: I have compassion on the crowd, for already days three, they have remained with me, and not they have any thing they may eat; and to send away them fasting not I will, lest they may faint in the way.

33. And they say to him the disciples of him: Whence to us in a desert place loaves so many, so as to satisfy a crowd so great?

34. And says to them the Jesus: How many loaves have you? They and said: Seven, and few small fishes.

35. And he directed the crowds to recline upon the ground.

36. And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, giving thanks he broke and he gave to the disciples of him, the and disciples to the crowd.

37. And they ate all, were filled; and they took up that over and above of the fragments, seven large baskets full.

38. They and eating were for thousand men, besides woman and children.

39. And having sent away the crowds, he went into the ship, and came to the coasts of Magdala.

## Matthew 16

1. And coming the Pharisees and Sadducees, tempting they asked him, a sign from the heaven to show to them.

2. He but answering said to them: Evening coming, you say: Fair weather; reddens for the heaven.

3. And in the morning; Today a storm; is red for lowering the heaven. Hypocrites, the truly face of the heaven you know to judge, the but signs of the times not can you?

4. A generation evil and adulterous a sign seeks; and a sign not shall be given to her, except the sign of Jonas the prophet. And leaving them, he went away.

5. And coming the disciples of him to the other side, had forgotten loaves to take.

6. The and Jesus said to them: Look and take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

7. They and reasoned among themselves saying: Because loaves not we have brought.

8. Knowing and the Jesus said: Why reason you among yourselves, O you weak of faith, because loaves not you have brought?

9. Not yet perceive you, nor remember you the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?

10. Nor the seven loaves of the for thousand, and how many large baskets you took up?

11. Why not do you perceive, that not about bread I spoke to you to take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?

12. Then they understood, that not he did say beware of the leaven of the bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13. Coming and the Jesus into the parts of Caesarea of the Philip, asked the disciples of him, saying: Who me say the men to be, the son of the man?

14. They and said: Some, John the dipper; others and, Elias; other and, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

15. He says to them: You but who me say to be?

16. Answering and Simon Peter said:Thou art the Anointed, the son of the God the living.

17. And answering the Jesus said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonas; for flesh and blood not it has revealed to thee, but the Father of me, that in the heavens.

18. Also I and to thee say, that thou art a rock, and upon this the rock I will build of me the church, and gates of hades not shall prevail against her.

19. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatever thou mayest bind upon the earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatever thou mayest loose upon the earth, shall be loosed in the heavens.

20. Then he charged the disciples of him, that no one they should tell that he is the Anointed.

21. From that time began the Jesus to show to the disciples of him, that must he to go to Jerusalem, and many (things) to suffer from the elders and highpriests and scribes, and to be killed, and the third day to be raised.

22. And taking aside him the Peter, began to reprove him, saying: Be it far from thee, O lord; not not shall be to thee this.

23. He but turning said to the Peter: Go thou behind of me, adversary; a stumbling block of me thou art; for not thou regardest the (things) of the God, but those of the men.

24. Then the Jesus said to the disciples of him: If any one wish after me to come, let him deny himself, and let him bear the cross of him, and follow me.

25. Whoever for may wish the life of him to save, shall lose her; whoever and may lose the life of him on account of me, shall find her.

26. What for is profited a man if the world whole he may win, the and life of him he may forfeit? or what shall give a man in exchange for the life of him?

27. Is about for the the son of the man to come in the glory of the Father of him, with the messengers of him, and then he will render to each one according to the behavior of him.

28. Indeed I say to you, there are some of those here having stood, who not not shall taste of death, till they may see the son of the man coming in the royal majesty of him.

## Matthew 17

1. And after days six takes the Jesus the Peter, and James, and John the brother of him; and leads up them into a mountain high privately.

2. And he was transfigured in the presence of them, and shone the face of him as the sun; the and garments of him become white as the light.

3. And lo, appeared to them Moses and Elias with him talking.

4. Answering and the Peter said to the Jesus: O lord, good it is us here to be; if thou wilt, we may make here three tents, to thee one, and Moses one, and one Elias.

5. Still of him speaking, lo, a cloud of light overshadowed them; and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is the son of me the beloved, in whom I delight; of him hear you.

6. And having heard the disciples, they fell upon face of them, and were frightened greatly.

7. And coming near the Jesus, touched them, and said: Be you raised, and not be afraid.

8. Lifting up then the eyes of them, no one they saw, except the Jesus alone.

9. And descending of them, from the mountain, charged them the Jesus, saying: To no one you may tell the vision, till the son of the man from dead (ones) should be raised.

10. And asked him the disciples of him, saying: Why then the scribes say, that Elias must to come first?

11. The but Jesus answering said to them: Elias truly comes first, and shall restore all things;

12. I say but to you, that Elias just now came, and not they knew him, but have done to him as much as they wished; thus also the son of the man is about to suffer by them.

13. Then understood the disciples, that concerning John the dipper he spoke to them.

14. And having come of them to the crowd, came to him a man, kneefalling him,

15. and saying: O lord, have pity on me the son; for he is moonstruck, and sadly suffers; often for he falls into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to the disciples of thee, and not they were able him to heal.

17. Answering and the Jesus said: O generation unfaithful and having been perverted; till when shall I be with you? till when shall I bear you? bring you to me him here.

18. And rebuked him the Jesus, and came out of him the demon; and was cured the boy from the hour that.

19. Then coming the disciples to the Jesus by himself, said: Why we not were able to cast out it?

20. The and Jesus said to them: On account of the unbelief of you. Indeed for I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard, you will say to the mountain this. Be thou removed from here there, and it will remove; and nothing will be impossible to you.

21. This but the kind not goes out, if not in prayer and fasting.

22. Were traveling and of them in the Galilee, said to them the Jesus: Is about the son of the man to be delivered up into hands of men,

23. and they will kill him; and the third day he will be raised. And they were grieved exceedingly.

24. Having arrived and of them at Capernaum, came those the didrachmas receiving to the Peter, and said: The teacher of you not pays the didrachmas?

25. He says: Yes. And when he was come into the house, anticipated him the Jesus, saying: Which to thee seems right, Simon? The kings of the earth from whom do they take taxes or census? from the sons of them, or from the aliens?

26. Says to him the Peter: From the aliens. Says to him the Jesus: Then exempt are the sons.

27. That but not we may offend them, going to the sea, cast thou a hook, and the ascending first fish take up; and opening the mouth of him, thou wilt find a stater; that taking, give to them for me and thee.

## Matthew 18

1. In that the hour came the disciples to the Jesus, saying: Who then greater is in the kingdom of the heaven?

2. And having called the Jesus a little child placed it in midst of them,

3. and said: Indeed I say to you, if not you be changed and become as the little children, not not you may enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

4. Whoever therefore may humble himself as the little child this, he is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens.

5. And whoever may receive a little child such one on the name of me, me receives.

6. Who but ever may insnare one of the littleones these, of the believing into me, it is appropriate to him, that should be hung a millstone upper on the neck of him, and he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.

7. Woe to the world from the snares. Necessary for it is to come the snares; but woe to the man to that through whom the snare comes.

8. If therefore the hand of thee or the foot of thee insnares thee, cut off them, and cast from thee; good to thee it is to enter into the life lame or a cripple, than two hands or two feet having to be cast into the fire the agelasting.

9. And if the eye of thee insnares thee, tear out it, and cast from thee; good of thee it is oneeyed into the life to enter, than two eyes having to be cast into the Gehenna of the fire.

10. See, not you may despise one of the littleones these; I say for to you that the messengers of them in heavens perpetually see the face of the Father of me, that in heavens.

11. Is come for the son of the man to save the having been lost.

12. What to you seems right? if should have any man a hundred sheep, and should go astray one from them; not leaving the ninetynine upon the mountain, going he seeks that having strayed?

13. And if he should happen to find it, indeed I say to you, that he rejoices over it more, than over the ninenine, those not having been led astray.

14. Thus not it is will in the presence of the Father of you of that in heavens, that should perish one of the littleones of them.

15. If and should in error against thee the brother of thee, go, test him between thee and him alone. If thee he may hear thou hast won the brother of thee;

16. If but not he may hear, take with thee besides one or two; that by mouth two of witnesses or of three may be proved every word.

17. If and he should disregard them, tell thou to the congregation; if and also of the congregation he should disregard, let him be to thee as the Gentile and the taxgather.

18. Indeed i say to you, whatever you may bind on the earth, shall be having been bound in the heaven; and whatever you may loose on the earth, shall be having been loosed in the heaven.

19. Again I say to you, that if two of you may agree upon the earth, about any matter, whatever they may ask, it shall be to them from the Father of me, of that in heavens.

20. Where for are two or three having come together in the my name, there i am in the midst of them.

21. Then coming to him the Peter, said: O lord, how often shall sin against me the brother of me, and I shall forgive him? till seven times?

22. Says to him the Jesus: Not I say to thee, till seven times, but till seventy times seven.

23. Therefore this has been compared the kingdom of the heavens to a man king, who wished to settle an account with the slaves of him.

24. Having begun and of him to settle, they brought to him one a debtor of ten thousand talents.

25. Not having but of him to pay, ordered him the lord of him to be sold, and the wife of him, and the children, and all as much as he had, and payment to be made.

26. Falling down therefore the slave he prostrated to him, saying: O lord, have patience with me, and all to thee I will pay.

27. being moved with pity then the lord of the slave of that, loosed him, and the debt remitted to him.

28. Going out but the slave that, found one of the fellowslaves of him, who owned to him a hundred denarii; and seizing him he coked him, saying: Pay to me if any thing thou owest.

29. Falling down therefore the fellowslave of him, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and all I will pay to thee.

30. He and not he would; but going away he cast him into prison, till he should pay that he was owing.

31. Seeing and the fellowslaves of him that having been done, were grieved much; and going they related to the lord of them all that having been done.

32. Then having called him the lord of him, says to him: O slave wicked, all the debt that I remitted to thee, because thou besought me;

33. not was it binding also thee to have pitied the fellow slave of thee, as also I thee pitied?

34. And being provoked the lord of him delivered him to the jailors, till he may pay all that owing to him.

35. So also the Father of me the heavenly will do to you if not you forgive each one the brother of him from the hearts of you.

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass, when ended the Jesus the words these, he departed from the Galilee, and came into the confines of the Judea, beyond the Jordan.

2. And followed him crowds great; and he healed them there.

3. And came to him the Pharisees, trying him, and saying to him: If it is lawful to a man to release the wife of him upon every cause?

4. He and answering said to them: Not have you read, that the Creator from a beginning a male and a female he made them?

5. and said: On account of this shall leave a man the father and the mother, and shall be closely united to the wife of him; and shall be the two into flesh one.

6. So that no longer they are two, but flesh one. What then the God has joined together, a man not disunites.

7. They say to him: Why then Moses did enjoin to give a scroll of separation, and to release her?

8. He says to them: That Moses for the hardness of heart of you suffered you to release the wives of you; from a beginning but not it was so.

9. I say but to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except for fornication, and may marry another, commits adultery; and he her being released marrying, commits adultery.

10. They say to him the disciples of him: If thus is the case of the man with woman, not it is profitable to marry.

11. He but said to them: Not all admit the word this, but to whom it has been given.

12. There are for eunuchs, who from womb of mother were born so; and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by the men; and there are eunuchs, who made eunuchs themselves on account of the kingdom of the heavens. He being able to admit, let him admit.

13. Then were brought to him little children that the hands he might lay on them, and he might pray; the but the disciples rebuked them.

14. The and Jesus said: Suffer the little children and not hinder them to come to me; of the for such like is the kingdom of the heavens.

15. And laying on them the hands, he departed thence.

16. And lo, one coming, said to him: O teacher good, what good must I do, that I may have life agelasting?

17. He and he said to him: Why me askest thou concerning the good? one is the good. If but thou wishest to enter into the life, keep strictly the commandments.

18. He says to him: Which? The and Jesus said: This; Not thou shalt kill; Not thou shalt commit adultery; Not thou shalt steal; Not thou shall testify falsely;

19. Honor the father and the mother; and Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee as thyself.

20. Says to him the young man: All these I kept from childhood of me; what more do I want?

21. Said to him the Jesus: If thou wishest perfect to be, go, sell of thee the possessions, and give to poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and hither, follow me.

22. Having heard and the young man the word, went away sorrowing; he was for having possessions many.

23. The and Jesus said to the disciples of himself: Indeed I say to you, that with difficulty a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

24. Again and I say to you, easier it is a camel through a hole of needle to pass, than a rich man into the kingdom of the God to enter.

25. Having heard and the disciples, were amazed exceedingly, saying: Who then is able to be saved?

26. Looking but the Jesus said to him: With man this impossible is; with but God all possible.

27. Then answering the Peter said to him: Lo, we left all, and followed thee; what then shall be to us?

28. The and Jesus said to them: Indeed I say to you, that you the having followed me, in the new birth day when may sit the son of the man upon a throne of glory of him, shall sit also you upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of the Israel.

29. And all who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, on account of the name of me, a hundred fold shall receive, and life agelasting shall inherit.

30. Many but shall be first, last and last first.

## Matthew 20

1. Like for is the kingdom of the heavens to a man a householder, who went out with morning to hire laborers into the vineyard of him.

2. Having agreed and with the laborers for a denarius the day, he sent him into the vineyard of him.

3. And going out about third hour, he saw others standing in the marketplace idle;

4. and to them he said: Go and you into the vineyard; and whatever may be just, I will give you. They and went away.

5. Again going out about sixth and ninth hour, he did in like manner.

6. About and the eleventh hour going out, he found others standing, and he says to them: Why here stood you all the day idle?

7. They say to him: Because no one us hired. He says to them: Go also you into the vineyard; and whatever maybe just, you shall receive.

8. Evening and having come on, says the lord of the vineyard to the steward of him: Call the laborers, and give to them the hire, beginning from the last, till the first.

9. And having come those about the eleventh hour, received each a denarius.

10. Having then those first, supposed, that more they shall receive; and received also they each a denarius.

11. Having received but they murmured against the householder,

12. saying: That these the last one hour worked, and equal to us them thou hast made, to the having endured the burden of the day, and the burning heat.

13. He but answering said to one of them: Friend, not I wrong thee; not of a denarius didst thou agree to me?

14. Take thee thine and go, I wish and to this the last to give as also of thee.

15. Or not is it lawful to me to do what I will with the my own? or the eye of thee evil is, because I good am?

16. Thus shall be the last, first; and the first, last. Many for are called, few but chosen.

17. And going up the Jesus to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples privately in the way, and said to them:

18. Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the son of the man will be delivered up to the highpriests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death,

19. and they will deliver up him to the Gentiles for the to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and in the third day he will stand up.

20. Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with the sons of her, prostrating, and asking something from him.

21. He and said to her: What wilt thou? She says to him: Say that may sit these the two sons of me, one at right of thee, and one at left of thee, in the kingdom of thee.

22. Answering but the Jesus said: Not you know, what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup, which I am about to drink? They say to him: We are able.

23. And he says to them: The indeed cup of me you shall drink; the but to sit at right of me and at left of me, not is mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared by the Father of me.

24. And having heard the ten, were angry on account of the two brothers.

25. The but Jesus, having called them, said: You know, that the rulers of the nations domineer over them. Not thus great exercise authority over them.

26. Not thus it shall be among you; but whoever may wish among you great to become, let him be of you servant;

27. and whoever may wish among you to be first, let him be of you a slave;

28. even as the son of the man not came to be served but to serve, and to give the life of him a ransom for many.

29. And departing of them from Jericho, followed him a crowd great.

30. And lo, two blind men, sitting by the way, hearing that Jesus passes by, cried out, saying: Pity us, O lord, son of David.

31. The and crowd reproved them, that they might be silent. They but more did cry out, saying: Pity us, O lord, son of David.

32. And having stopped the Jesus he called them, and said: What do you wish I should do to you?

33. They say to him: O lord, that may be opened of us the eyes.

34. Being moved with pity and the Jesus, he touched the eyes of them; and immediately saw again of them the eyes; and they followed him.

## Matthew 21

1. And when they were nigh to Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage by the mountain of the olivetrees, then the Jesus sent away two disciples, saying to them:

2. You may go to the village the over against you, and immediately you will find an ass having been bound, and a foal with her; having loosed bring to me.

3. And if any (one) to you should say any (thing), you shall say: That the lord of them need has; immediately and he will need them.

4. This and all has been done, that might be fulfilled the word spoken through the prophets, saying:

5. Say to the daughter of Zion: Lo, the king of thee comes to thee meek, and having been set on an ass, even a foal a son of a beast of burden.

6. Having gone and the disciples, and having done as commanded to them the Jesus,

7. they led the ass and the foal, and they placed upon them the mantles of them; and they caused to sit on (one) of them.

8. The and greater crowd spread of themselves the mantles in the way; others and cut off branches from the trees, and scattered in the way.

9. The and crowds those going before and those following did cry, saying: Hosanna to the son of David; worthy of blessing he coming in name of Lord; hosanna in the highest.

10. And having entered of them into Jerusalem, was moved all the city, saying: Who is this?

11. The and crowds said: This is Jesus the prophet, that from Nazareth of the Galilee.

12. And entered the Jesus into the temple of the God, and cast out all the selling and buying in the temple, and the tables of the money changers overturned, and the seats of the selling the doves;

13. and he says to them: It is written The house of me, a house of prayer shall be called; you but it have made a den of robbers.

14. And came to him blind and lame in the temple, and he healed them.

15. Having seen but the highpriests and the scribes the wonders, which he did, and the boys crying in the temple, and saying: Hosanna to the son of David; they were angry,

16. and said to him: Hearest thou what these are saying? The and Jesus says them: Yes; Never have you read: That out of mouth of babes and of suckling (ones) thou has perfected praise?

17. And having left them, he went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there

18. Early but, returning into the city, he was hungry.

19. And seeing a figtree one by the way, he came to her, and nothing found in her except leaves alone; and he says to her: No more by thee fruit may be produced to the age. And withered immediately the figtree.

20. And seeing the disciples wondered, saying: How soon withered the figtree?

21. Answering and the Jesus said to them: Indeed I say to you, if you may have faith, and not should doubt, not only the (miracle) of the figtree you shall do, but also if to the mountain this you should say: Be thou lifted up, and be cast into the sea; it shall be done.

22. And all, whatever you shall ask in the prayer, believing you shall receive.

23. And having come to him into the temple, came to him teaching the highpriests and the elders of the people, saying: By what authority these (things) doest thou? and who to thee gave the authority this?

24. Answering and the Jesus said to them: I will ask you also I word one; which if you may say to me, also I to you will tell, by what authority these (things) I do;

25. the dipping of John whence was? from heaven, or from men? They and reasoned among themselves, saying: If we should say, from heaven; he will say to us: Why then not did you believe to him?

26. if but we should say from men; we fear the crowd; all for hold the John as a prophet.

27. And they answering to the Jesus said: Not we know. Said to them and he: Neither I say to you by what authority these (things) I do.

28. What but to you seems right? A man had children two; and coming to the first, he said: Son, go, today work in the vineyard of me.

29. He and answering said: Not I will; afterward but having changed his mind, he went.

30. And coming to the other, he said just the same. He and answering said: I lord, and not went.

31. Who of the two did the will of the father? They say to him: The first. Says to them the Jesus: Indeed I say to you, that the taxgatherers and the harlots go before you in the kingdom of the God.

32. Came for to you John in a way of righteousness, and not you believed him; the but taxgatherers and the harlots believed him; you and seeing not repented afterwards, of the to believe him.

33. Another parable hear you; a man was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and a hedge to it placed around, and digged in it a winepress, and built a tower; and let out it to husbandmen, and went abroad.

34. When and drew near the time of the fruits, he sent the slaves of him, to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it.

35. And having taken the husbandmen the slaves of him, him indeed they flayed, him and they killed, him and they pelted with stones.

36. Again he sent other slaves, greater the first; and they did to them in like manner.

37. Afterwards and he sent to them the son of him, saying: They will regard the son of me.

38. The but husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir; come, we may kill him, and may retain the inheritance of him.

39. And having taken him, they cast out of the vineyard, and killed.

40. When therefore may come the lord of the vineyard, what will he do to the husbandmen to those?

41. They say to him: Wretches wretchedly destroy them; and the vineyard will let out to other husbandmen, who will render to him the fruits in the seasons of them.

42. He says to them the Jesus: Never have you read in the writings: A stone which rejected they building, the same was made into a head of a corner; from Lord was this, and it is wonderful in eyes of us?

43. On account of this I say to you, that shall be taken from you the kingdom of the God, and shall be given to a nation making the fruits of her.

44. And he falling on the stone this, shall be broken; on whom but it shall fall, it will crush to pieces him.

45. And having heard the highpriests and the Pharisees the parables of him, knew, that about them he says.

46. And seeking him to seize, they feared the crowds; since as a prophet him they held.

## Matthew 22

1. And answering the Jesus again said to them in parables, saying:

2. Has been likened the kingdom of the heavens to a man a king, who made marriagefeasts to the son of him,

3. and he sent the slaves of him, to call the having been invited to the marriagefeasts; and not they would to come.

4. Again he sent other slaves, saying: Say to the having been called; Lo, the dinner of me I prepared; the bullocks of me and the fatlings having been killed, and all (things) ready, come to the marriagefeasts.

5. They but neglecting went away; he indeed to the own field, he and to the traffic of him.

6. The and remainder having seized the slaves of him, insulted and killed.

7. Having heard and the king, was wroth; and having sent the armies of him, destroyed the murderers those, and the city of them burned.

8. Then he says to the slaves of him; the indeed marriagefeast ready is, they but having been called not were worthy.

9. Go you therefore to the outlets of the ways, and whoever you may find, call you to the marriagefeasts.

10. And having gone forth the slaves those into the ways, they brought together all, as many as they found, bad ones both and good ones; and was filled the marriagefeast of reclining ones.

11. Having entered and the king to see the reclining ones, saw there a man not having been clothed a garment of marriage;

12. and he says to him: Friend, how didst thou enter here, not having a garment of marriage? He but was struck speechless.

13. Then said the king to the servants: Having bound of him feet and hands, take him, and cast into the darkness the outer; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

14. Many for are called, few but picked out.

15. Then having gone the Pharisees counsel took, how him they might insnare in word.

16. And they sent away to him the disciples of them with the Herodians, saying: O teacher, we know, that true thou art, and the way of the God in truth thou teachest, and not there is care to thee about no one; not for thou lookest into face of men.

17. Say therefore to us, what to thee seems right? is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

18. Knowing but the Jesus the wickedness of them, said: Why me tempt you hypocrites?

19. Show you to me the coin of the tribute. They and brought to him a denarius.

20. And he says to them: Of whom the likeness this and the inscription?

21. They say to him: Of Caesar. Then he says to them: Give you back then the (things) of Caesar to Caesar; and the (things) of the God to the God.

22. And having heard they wondered: and leaving him they departed.

23. In that the day came to him Sadducees, they saying, not to be a resurrection; and they asked him,

24. saying: O teacher, Moses said: If any one should die not having children, shall marry the brother of him the wife of him, and shall raise seed to the brother of him.

25. There were now with us seven brothers; and the first having married, died; and not having seed, left the wife of him to the brother of him.

26. Likewise also the second, and the third till the seven.

27. After and of all died also the woman.

28. In the therefore resurrection, of whom of the seven shall be a wife? all for had her.

29. Answering and the Jesus said to them: You go astray, not knowing the writings, neither the power of the God.

30. In for the resurrection neither they marry, nor are given in marriage, but as messengers of the God in heaven are.

31. About but the resurrection of the dead (ones) not have you read that having been spoken to you by the God, saying:

32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? Not is the God, a God of dead (ones), but of living (ones).

33. And having heard the crowds, were astonished at the teaching of him.

34. The and Pharisees, hearing that he silenced the Sadducees, were assembled on the same;

35. and asked one out of them, a lawyer, tempting him and saying:

36. O teacher, which commandment great in the law?

37. The and Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love Lord the God of thee, in whole the heart of thee, and in whole the soul of thee, and in whole the mind of thee.

38. This first and great commandment.

39. Second and like to it; Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee, as thyself.

40. In these the two commandments whole the law and the prophets are hung.

41. Having been assembled and of the Pharisees, asked them the Jesus,

42. saying: What to you thinks about the Anointed? of whom a son is he? They say to him: Of the David.

43. He says to them: How then David in spirit Lord of him calls? saying:

44. Said the Lord to the lord of me; Sit thou at right of me, till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool of the feet of thee.

45. If then David calls him lord, how a son of him is he?

46. And no one was able to him to answer a word; nor dared any one from that the day to ask him any more.

## Matthew 23

1. Then the Jesus spoke to the crowds and to the disciples of him,

2. saying: Upon the Moses seat sit the scribes and the Pharisees.

3. All therefore, whatever they say to you to observe observe you and do you; according to but the works of them not do you; They say for, and not they do.

4. They bind for burdens heavy and oppressive, and place upon the shoulders of the men; of the and finger of them not they will to move them.

5. All but the works of them they do to the to be seen to the men. They widen and the phylacteries of them, and they enlarge the tufts of the mantles of them;

6. they love and the upper couch in the feasts, and the first seats in the synagogues,

7. and the salutations in the markets, and to be called by the men rabbi, rabbi;

8. You but not may be called rabbi; one for is of you the leader; all but you brethren are.

9. And father not you may call of you on the earth; one for is the Father of you, he in the heavens.

10. Neither be ye called leaders; one for of you is the leader, the Anointed.

11. The but greater of you, shall be of you a servant.

12. Who and shall exalt himself, shall be humbled; and who shall humble himself, shall be exalted.

13. Woe but to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you devour the houses of the widows, and for a show long are praying; through this you shall receive heavier judgment.

14. Woe to you, scribes, and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you shut the kingdom of the heavens in presence of the men; you for not enter, nor the entering you permit to enter.

15. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees hypocrites; because you go about the sea and the dry, to make one proselyte; and when he becomes, you make him a son of Gehenna double of you.

16. Woe to you guides blind, the saying: Whoever may swear by the temple, nothing it is; who but ever may swear by the gold of the temple, he is bound.

17. O fools and blind; which for greater is? the gold, or the temple, that sanctifying the gold?

18. Also; Whoever may swear by altar, nothing it is; who but ever may swear by the gift that upon it, he is bound.

19. O fools and blind; which for greater? the gift, or the altar, that sanctifying the gift?

20. He then answering by the altar swears by it and by all the (things) upon it;

21. and the swearing by the temple, swears by it and by the (one) having inhabited it;

22. and he swearing by the heaven, swears by the throne of the God and by the (one) sitting upon it.

23. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you tithe the mint, and the dill, and the cummin; and pass by the weightier (things) of the law, the justice, and mercy, and the faith. These but it is binding to do, and those not to omit.

24. Guides blind; the straining out the gnat the but camel swallowing down.

25. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, within but they are full of rapine and injustice.

26. O Pharisee blind, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that may become also the outside of them clean.

27. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you are like to tombs having been whitened, which without indeed appear beautiful, within but are full of bones of dead and of all uncleanness.

28. So and you without indeed appear to the men just, within but full are of hypocrisy and of lawlessness.

29. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the just,

30. and say: If we had been in the days of the fathers of us, not we had been partakers of them in the blood of the prophets.

31. So that you testify to yourselves, that sons you are of the having killed the prophets.

32. And you fill you the measure of the fathers of you.

33. O serpents, O broods of vipers; how can you flee from the judgment of the Gehenna?

34. Because of this, lo, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and out of them you will kill and will crucify, and out of them you will scourge in the synagogues of you and pursue from city to city;

35. so that may come upon you all blood righteous, being shed upon the earth from the blood of Abel the just to the blood of Zecharias a son of Barachias, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.

36. Indeed I say to you, that shall come these (things) all upon the generation this.

37. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killing the prophets, and stoning the having been sent to her; how often I desired to gather the children of thee, what manner gathers a bird the brood of herself under the wings? and not you were willing.

38. Lo, is left to you the house of you a desert.

39. I say for to you: Not not me you may see from now, till you may say: Having been blessed he coming in name of Lord.

## Matthew 24

1. And being come out the Jesus was going from the temple; and came the disciples of him to point out to him the buildings of the temple.

2. The and Jesus said to them: Not you see all these? Indeed I say to you, not not should be left here a stone upon stone, which not shall be thrown down.

3. Sitting and of him upon the mountain of the olive tree, came to him the disciples privately saying: Tell to us, when these (things) shall be? and what the sign of the thy presence and of the end of the age?

4. And answering the Jesus said to them: Take heed, not any one you may deceive.

5. Many for shall come in the name of me, saying: I am the Anointed; and many they shall deceive.

6. You shall be about and to hear wars, and reports of wars; see, not you be disturbed; it behooves for all to take place; but not yet is the end.

7. Shall be raised up for nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and plagues, and earthquakes in places.

8. All but these a beginning of sorrows.

9. Then they shall deliver up you to affliction, and shall kill you; and you shall be being hated by all of the nations on account of the name of me.

10. And then shall be caused to stumble many; and each other shall deliver up, and shall hate each other.

11. And many falseprophets shall be raised up, and shall deceive many;

12. and because of the to be increased the lawlessness, shall be cooled the love of the many.

13. He but holding out the end, the same shall be saved.

14. And shall be published this the glad tidings of the kingdom in whole the habitable, for a testimony to all the nations; and then shall come the end.

15. When therefore you may see the abomination of the desolation, the word having been spoken through Daniel the prophet, having stood in place holy; (he reading let him think;)

16. then they in the Judea, let them flee to the mountains;

17. he upon the roof, not let him go down, to take the out of the house of him;

18. and he in the field, not let him turn back, to take the mantle of him.

19. Woe and to the in womb having and to the giving suck in those the days.

20. Pray you and, that not may be the flight of you of winter, nor in sabbath.

21. Shall be for then affliction great, such as not has been from a beginning of world till the now, nor not not may be.

22. And except were shortened the days those, not should be saved all flesh; on account of but the chosen shall be shortened the days those.

23. Then if any to you should say: Lo, here the Anointed, or here; not you believe.

24. Shall be raised for false anointed ones and false prophets, and shall give signs great and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible even the chosen.

25. Lo, I have foretold to you.

26. If then they should say to you: Lo, in the desert he is; not you should go out; Lo, in the retired places; not you should believe;

27. As for the lightning comes out from east, and shines to west, so shall be also the presence of the son of the man.

28. Where for ever may be the carcass, there will be gathered the eagles.

29. Immediately but after the affliction of the days those, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon not shall give the light of her, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

30. And then shall appear the sign of the son of the man in the heaven; and then shall lament all the tribes of the earth, and they shall see the son of the man coming upon the clouds of the heaven, with power and glory much;

31. and he will send the messengers of him with of trumpet a voice great; and they shall gather the chosen (ones) of him from the four winds, from extremities of heavens to extremities of them.

32. From but the figtree learn you the parable; when already the branch of her may be tender, and the leaves may put forth, you know, that near the summer;

33. So also you, when you may see all these, know you, that near it is at doors.

34. Indeed I say to you, not not may pass away the generation this, till all these may be done.

35. The heaven and the earth shall pass away; the but words of me not not may pass away.

36. About and the day that and hour no one knows, nor the messengers of the heavens, except the Father alone.

37. As and the days of the Noah, even so will be also the presence of the son of the man.

38. As for they were in the days the before the flood eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, till of which day entered Noah into the ark,

39. and not they knew, till came the flood and took away all; even so will be also the presence of the son of the man.

40. Then two shall be in the field; the one is taken away and the one is left.

41. Two grinding in the mill; one is taken away, and one is left.

42. Watch you therefore, because not you know, in what hour the lord of you comes.

43. This but know you, that if had known the householder in what watch the thief comes, he would have watched, and not would have allowed to be dugthrough the house of him.

44. On account of this also you be ready; because in which hour not you think, the son of the man comes.

45. Who then is the faithful slave and prudent, whom placed the lord of him over the domestics of him, of the to give to them the food in season?

46. Blessed the slave that, whom coming the lord of him shall find doing so.

47. Indeed I say to you, that over all the possessions of him he will place him.

48. If but should say the bad slave that in the heart of him: Delays the lord of me to come;

49. and should begin to strike the fellowslaves, may eat and also may drink with those getting drunk;

50. shall come the lord of the slave that in a day, in which not he expects, and in an hour, in which not he knows;

51. and shall cut asunder him, and the part of him with the hypocrites will place; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

## Matthew 25

1. Then will be compared the kingdom of the heavens ten virgins, who having taken the lamps of them, went out to a meeting of the bridegroom.

2. Five and were of them prudent, and five foolish.

3. Who foolish, having taken the lamps of them, not took with themselves oil.

4. The but prudent took oil in the vessels of them with the lamps of them.

5. Delaying and the bridegroom, nodded all, and did sleep.

6. Of middle and night a cry was raised; Lo, the bridegroom comes; go out to a meeting of him.

7. Then arose all the virgins those, and put in order the lamps of them.

8. The but foolish to the prudent said: Give to us out of the oil of you, because the lamps of us are extinguished.

9. Answered but the prudent, saying: Lest not it might suffice to us and to you; go you rather to the selling, and buy to yourselves.

10. Going away and of them to buy, came the bridegroom; and the prepared ones entered with him into the nuptialfeasts; and was closed the door.

11. Afterwards and came also the remaining virgins, saying: O lord, O lord, open to us.

12. The but answering said: Indeed I say to you, not know you.

13. Watch you therefore, because not you know the day, nor the hour.

14. Like for a man going abroad called the own slaves, and delivered to them the goods of him.

15. and to him indeed he gave five talents, to him and two, to him and one; to each according to the own power; and went abroad immediately.

16. Going and he the five talents having received, traded with them, and made other five talents.

17. Likewise also he the two, gained also he other two.

18. He but the one having received having retired digged in the earth, and hid the silver of the lord of him.

19. After but time much comes the lord of the slaves those, and adjusts with them an account.

20. And coming he the five talents having received, brought other five talents, saying: O lord, five talents to me thou delivered; see, other five talents I gained upon them.

21. Said to him the lord of him: Well, O slave good and faithful; over a few (things) thou wast faithful, over many thee I will place; enter into the joy of the lord of thee.

22. Coming and also he the two talents having received, said: O lord, two talents to me thou deliveredst; lo, other two talents I gained upon them;

23. Said to him the lord of him: Well, O slave good and faithful; over a few (things) thou wast faithful, over many thee I will place; enter into the joy of the lord of thee.

24. Coming and also he the one talent having taken, said: O lord, I knew thee, that hard thou art a man, reaping where not thou sowed, and gathering whence not thou scatteredst;

25. and being afraid, going away I hid the talent of thee in the earth; lo, thou hast the thine.

26. Answering and the lord of him said to him: O wicked slave and slothful, didst thou know, that I reap where not I sowed, and gather whence not I scattered?

27. It behooved then thee cast the silver of me to the bankers; and coming I might have received the mine with interest.

28. Take you therefore from him the talent, and give to him having the ten talents.

29. To the for having all shall be given, and he shall abound; from but the not having, even what he has, shall be taken away from him.

30. And the useless slave cast you into the darkness the outer; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

31. When and may come the son of the man in the glory of him, and all the messengers with him, then shall be sit on a throne of glory of him,

32. and will be gathered in presence of him all the nations; and he will separate them from each other, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;

33. and and he will place the indeed sheep by right of him, the and goats by left.

34. Then will say the king to the by right of him: Come the having been blessed of the Father of me, inherit the having been prepared to you kingdom from a foundation of world.

35. I hungered for, and you gave to me to eat; I thirsted, and you gave drink to me; a stranger I was, and you entertained me;

36. naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; in prison I was, and you came to me.

37. Then shall answer to him the just one, saying: O lord, when thee we saw hungering, and nourished? or thirsting, and we gave drink?

38. When and thee we saw a stranger, and we entertained? or naked, and we clothed?

39. When and thee we saw sick, or in prison, and we came to thee?

40. And answering the king will say to them: Indeed I say to you, in whatever you did, to one of these of the brothers of me of the least, to me you did.

41. Then he will say also to the of left: Go from me the having been cursed into the fire the everlasting, that having been prepared to the accuser and to the messengers of him.

42. I hungered for, and not you gave to me to eat; I thirsted, and not you gave drink to me;

43. a stranger I was, and not you entertained me; naked, and not you clothed me; sick, and in prison, and not you visited me.

44. Then will answer and they, saying: O lord, when thee we saw hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and not we served thee?

45. Then he will answer them, saying: Indeed I say to you, in as much not you did to one of these of the least, neither to me you did.

46. And shall go away these into a cuttingoff agelasting; the and just ones into life agelasting.

## Matthew 26

1. And it happened, when had finished the Jesus all the words these, he said to the disciples of him:

2. You know, that after two days the passover comes on; and the son of the man is delivered into the to be crucified.

3. Then were assembled the highpriests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, into the court of the highpriest, that being called Caiaphas;

4. and they consulted, that the Jesus with deceit they might seize and might kill.

5. They said but: Not in the feast, that not a tumult there should be among the people.

6. The and Jesus having arrived in Bethany, in a house of Simon the leper,

7. came to him a woman, an alabaster box of balsam having great value, and she poured upon the head of him being reclined.

8. Seeing and the disciples of him, were displeased, saying: On account of what the loss this?

9. She was able for this to have sold of much, and to have given to poor.

10. Knowing and the Jesus said to them: Why troubles present you the woman? a work for good she was wrought for me.

11. Always for the poor you have with yourselves; me but not always you have.

12. Having cast for she the balsam this upon the body of me, to the to prepare for burial me she did.

13. Indeed I say to you, wherever may be published the glad tidings this, in whole the world, shall be spoken also what did she, for a memorial of her.

14. Then going one of the twelve he being named Judas Iscariot, to the highpriests,

15. said: What are you willing to me to give, and I to you will deliver up him? They and paid to him thirty pieces of silver.

16. And from then he did seek opportunity, that him he might deliver up.

17. The and first of the feasts of unleavened bread came the disciples of the Jesus, saying to him: Where wilt thou we make ready to thee to eat the passover?

18. He and said: Go you into the city to the certain one, and say to him: The teacher says: The season of me nigh is; to thee I will make the passover with the disciples of me.

19. And did the disciples as commanded to them the Jesus; and they prepared the passover.

20. Of evening and being come he reclined with the twelve.

21. And of eating of them, he said: Indeed I say to you, that one of you will deliver up me.

22. And being grieved exceedingly, they began to say to him each one of them: Not I am, O lord?

23. He but answering said: He dipping with me in the bowl the hand, this me, will deliver up.

24. The indeed son of the man goes as it has been written about him; Woe but to the man that, through whom the son of the man is delivered up; good it was to him, if not was born the man that.

25. Answering and Judas, he delivering up him, said: Not I am, rabbi? He says to him: Thou hast said.

26. Eating and of them, having taken the Jesus the loaf and having blessed, broke, and did give to the disciples, and said: Take you, eat you; This is the body of me.

27. And having taken the cup, and having given thanks, he gave to them, saying: Drink you out of it all;

28. this for is the blood of me, that of the new covenant, that about many being shed for forgiveness of sins.

29. I say but to you, that not not I will drink from now of this the product of the vine, till the day that, when it I drink with you new in the kingdom of the Father of me.

30. And having sung a hymn, they departed to the mountain of the olivetrees.

31. Then he says to them the Jesus: All you will be stumbled at me in the night this; it is written for: I will smite the shepherd, and will be scattered the sheep of the fold.

32. After but the to be raised me, I will go before you to the Galilee.

33. Answering and the Peter said to him: If all shall be stumbled at thee, I never will be stumbled.

34. Said to him the Jesus: Indeed I say to thee, that in this the night, before a cock to have crowed, thrice thou wilt deny me.

35. Says to him the Peter: And if it may behoove me with thee to die, not not thee I will deny. In like manner also all the disciples said.

36. Then comes with them the Jesus into a place being called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples: Sit you here, while going away I shall pray there.

37. And having taken the Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and to be in anguish.

38. Then he says to them: Extremely sorrowful is the soul of me to death; remain you here and watch you with me.

39. And going forward a little, he fell on face of him, praying, and saying: O Father of me, if possible it is, let pass from me the cup this; but not as I will, but as thou.

40. And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and he says to the Peter: So not could you one hour to watch with me?

41. Watch you and pray you, that not you enter into temptations; and indeed spirit ready, the but flesh weak.

42. Again, a second time going away, he prayed, saying: O Father of me, if not it is possible this, the cup to pass from me, except it I drink, be done the will of thee.

43. And coming he finds them again sleeping; (were for of them the eyes weighed down;)

44. and leaving them, going away again, he prayed a third time, the same word speaking.

45. Then he comes to the disciples of him, and says to them: Sleep you the remainder and rest you? lo, has come nigh the hour, and the son of man is delivered up into hands of sinners.

46. Arise, let us go; lo, has come nigh he delivering up me.

47. And while of him speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a crowd great with swords and clubs, from the highpriests and elders of the people.

48. He and delivering up him, gave to them a sign, saying: Who ever I may kiss, he it is; seize him.

49. And immediately approaching to the Jesus, he said to him: Hail rabbi; and kissed him.

50. The but Jesus said to him: Companion, for what art thou present? Then coming they laid the hands on the Jesus, and they seized him.

51. And lo, one of the with Jesus, stretching the hand, drew out the sword of him; and striking the slave of the highpriest, cut off of him the ear.

52. Then says to him the Jesus: Return thee the sword into the place of her; all for the taking a sword, by a sword shall perish.

53. Or thinkest thou, that not I am able now to entreat the Father of me, and will furnish to me more then twelve legions of messengers?

54. How then should be fulfilled the writings, that thus it must be done.

55. In that the hour said the Jesus to the crowds: As upon a robber came you out with swords and clubs, to take me; every day with you I did sit teaching in the temple, and not you seized me.

56. This but all has been done, that might be fulfilled the writings of the prophets. Then the disciples all, leaving him, they fled.

57. They and seizing the Jesus, they led to Caiaphas the highpriest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

58. The but Peter followed him at a distance, to the palace of the highpriest; and having gone in, sat with the attendants, to see the end.

59. The and highpriests and the elders and the highcouncil whole sought false testimony against the Jesus, so that him they might deliver to death.

60. And not they found, many falsewitnesses having come. Afterwards but coming two falsewitnesses

61. said: This affirmed; I am able to destroy the temple of the God, and in three days to build it.

62. And rising up the highpriest said to him: Nothing answerest thou? what these of thee testify against?

63. The but Jesus was silent. And answering the highpriest said to him: I adjure thee by the God of the living, that to us thou tell, if thou art the Anointed, the son of the God.

64. Says to him the Jesus: Thou has said. Besides I say to you, from now you shall see the son of the man sitting at right of the power, and coming upon the clouds of the heaven.

65. Then the highpriest rent the clothes of him, saying: That he blasphemes; what further need have we of witnesses? see, now you heard the blasphemy of him.

66. What to you thinks? they and answering said: Liable to death he is.

67. Then they spat into the face of him, and beat with the fist him: they and struck with palms of their hands,

68. saying: Prophesy to us, O Anointed, who is he striking thee?

69. The and Peter without sat in the courtyard. And came to him one maidservant, saying: Also thou wast with Jesus of the Galilee.

70. He but denied in presence of them all, saying: Not I know what thou sayest.

71. Going out and he into the portico, saw him another, and says to those there; also this was with Jesus of the Nazareth.

72. And again he denied with an oath; That not I know the man.

73. After a little and approaching those having stood by, said to the Peter: Certainly also thou of them art; even for the speech of thee manifest thee makes.

74. Then he began to curse, and to swear. That not I know the man. And instantly a cock crew.

75. And remembered the Peter of the word of the Jesus, declaring to him; That before a cock crows, thrice thou wilt deny me. And going out, he wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. Morning and having come, a council held all the highpriests and the elders of the people against the Jesus, so us to deliver to death him.

2. And binding him, they led, and delivered up him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

3. Then seeing Judas, that betraying him, that he was condemned, repenting he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the highpriests and the elders,

4. saying: I sinned, having delivered up blood innocent. They but said: What to us? Thou wilt see.

5. And hurling the pieces of silver in the temple, he withdrew; and having gone forth strangled himself.

6. The and highpriests, taking the pieces of silver, said: Not it is lawful to put them into the treasury, since price of blood it is.

7. Counsel and taking, they bought with them the field of the potter, to bury the strangers.

8. Therefore is called the field that, a field of blood, to the day.

9. Then was fulfilled the word spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the having been valued, whom they valued from sons of Israel,

10. and gave them for the field of the potter; even as directed me a Lord.

11. The and Jesus stood in presence of the governor; and asked him the governor, saying: Thou art the king of the Jews? The and Jesus said to him: Thou sayest.

12. And in the to be accused him by the highpriests and the elders, nothing he answered.

13. Then says to him the Pilate: Not thou hearest, how many things of thee they bear witness against?

14. And not he answered him to not even one word; so as to astonish the governor greatly.

15. At and a feast was accustomed the governor to release one to the crowd prisoner, whom they wished.

16. They had and then a prisoner noted, being called Barabbas.

17. Having being assembled then of them, said to them the Pilate: Which wish you I release to you? Barabbas or Jesus, the being called Anointed?

18. He knew for, that through envy they had delivered up him.

19. Being seated and of him upon the tribunal, sent to him the wife of him, saying: Nothing to thee and to the just one that; many things for I suffered this day in a dream because of him.

20. The but highpriests and the elders persuaded the crowds, that they should ask the Barabbas, the and Jesus they might destroy.

21. Answering and the governor said to them: Which wish you of the two I shall release to you? They and said: Barabbas.

22. He says to them the Pilate: What then shall I do Jesus, the being called Anointed? They say to him all: Let him be crucified.

23. The and governor said: What for evil has he done? They but vehemently cried, saying: Let him be crucified.

24. Seeing and the Pilate that nothing profits, but rather a tumult is made, taking water, he washed the hands before the crowd, saying: Innocent I am from the blood of the just of this; you shall see.

25. And answering all the people said: The blood of him upon us, and upon the children of us.

26. Then he released to them the Barabbas, the and Jesus having scourged he delivered up, that he might be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor taking the Jesus into the judgment hall, they gathered together to him whole the company.

28. And having stripped him, they put on to him a soldiers cloak scarlet.

29. And braiding a crown of thorns, placed upon the head of him, and a reed of the right of him; and bending the knee in presence of him, mocked him, saying: Hail, the king of the Jews.

30. And spitting on him, they took the reed, and struck on the head of him.

31. And when they had mocked him, they took off him the soldiers cloak, and put on him the garments of him; and led away him into the to be crucified.

32. Going out and, they met a man a Cyrenian, by name Simon; him they compelled, that he might carry the cross of him.

33. And coming into a place being called Golgotha, which is being called of a skull a place,

34. they gave to him to drink vinegar with gall having been mixed; and having tasted, not he would drink.

35. Crucifying and him, they divided the garments of him, casting a lot.

36. And being seated they watched him there.

37. And they placed above the head of him the accusation of him having been written: This is Jesus the king of the Jews.

38. Then were crucified with him two robbers; one by right, and one by left.

39. Those and passing along reviled him, shaking the heads of them,

40. and saying: He overthrowing the temple, and in three days building, save thyself; if a son thou art of the God, come down from the cross.

41. Likewise and also the highpriests, mocking with the scribes and elders, said:

42. Others he saved, himself not is able to save; if a king of Israel he is, let him come down now from the cross, and we will give credit to him.

43. He trusted in the God; let him rescue now him, if he wishes him; he said for: That of God I am a son.

44. That through it also the robbers, those being crucified with him, reproached him.

45. From now sixth hour darkness was on all the land, till hour ninth.

46. About and the ninth hour cried out the Jesus with a voice great, saying: Eli, Eli; lama sabachthani? that is: O God of me, O God of me; why me hast thou forsaken?

47. Some and of those there standing, having heard, said: For Elias he cries this.

48. And immediately running one of them, and taking a sponge, filling and of vinegar, and attaching to a reed, gave to drink him.

49. The but others said: Leave alone; we may see, if comes Elias, will be saving him.

50. The then Jesus, again crying with a voice great, resigned the breath.

51. And lo, the curtain of the temple was rent into two, from above to below; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent,

52. and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the having been asleep holy ones were raised,

53. and coming forth from the tombs, after the resurrection of him went into the holy city, and appeared to many.

54. The and centurion and those with him watching the Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things being done, they were afraid much, saying: Truly of God a son was this.

55. Were and there women many from a distance beholding; who followed the Jesus from the Galilee, ministering to him;

56. among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the of the James and Joses mother, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

57. Evening and being come, came a man rich from Arimathea, by name Joseph, who also himself was discipled to the Jesus.

58. He coming to the Pilate requested the body of the Jesus. Then the Pilate ordered to be given the body.

59. And taking the body the Joseph, wrapped it fine linen cloth clean;

60. and laid it in the new of himself tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and having rolled a stone great of the door of the tomb he went away.

61. Was and there Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.

62. The now next day, which is after the preparation, were assembled the highpriests and the Pharisees to the Pilate,

63. saying: O sir, we remember, that that the deceiver said while living: After three days I will arise.

64. Do thou command therefore to be made fast the tomb till the third day lest coming the disciples of him, might steal him, and might say to the people: He has been raised from the dead; and will be the last fraud worse of the first.

65. Said to them the Pilate: You have a guard; go you, make fast as you know.

66. They and going made fast the tomb, having sealed the stone, with the guard.

## Matthew 28

1. After now sabbath, to the dawning into first of week, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the tomb.

2. And lo, a shaking occurred great; a messenger for of a Lord, descending from heaven, approaching rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

3. Was and the aspect of him like lightning, and the garments of him white as snow.

4. From and the fear of him shook the keepers, and became as dead (men).

5. Answering and the messenger said to the women: Not be afraid you; I know for, that Jesus that having been crucified you seek.

6. Not he is here; he has been raised for, even as he said. Come see the place, where lay the Lord.

7. And quickly going tell the disciples of him, that he has been raised from the dead; and lo, he goes before you into the Galilee; there him you will see; lo, I told you.

8. And coming out quickly from the tomb with fear and joy great, they ran to inform the disciples of him.

9. As and they went to inform the disciples of him, and lo, the Jesus met them, saying: Hail you. They and having approached laid hold of him the feet, and prostrated to him.

10. Then says to them the Jesus: Not be afraid; go you, inform to the brethren of me, so that they may go into the Galilee, and there me they shall see.

11. Going away and of them, lo, some of the keepers, coming into the city, told to the highpriests all the (things) having been done.

12. And being assembled with the elders, counsel and taking, pieces of silver sufficient they gave to the soldiers, saying:

13. Say you, That the disciples of him, by night coming, stole him, of us being asleep.

14. And if should be reported this to the Governor, we will persuade him, and you free from care we will make.

15. They and having received the pieces of silver, did as they were taught. And is spread abroad the word this among Jews till the day.

16. The and eleven disciples went to the Galilee, to the mountain, where had appointed them the Jesus.

17. And seeing him, they prostrated to him; they but doubted.

18. And approaching the Jesus, spoke to them, saying: Has been given to me all authority in heaven and on earth.

19. Going forth disciple you all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit;

20. teaching them to observe all, whatever I have charged you. And lo, I with you am all the days, till the end of the age.
