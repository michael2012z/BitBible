# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Since many have undertaken to prepare a narrative about those having been fully established among us facts,

2. even as delivered to us those from a beginning eyewitnesses and ministers having been of the word;

3. it seemed right also to me, having traced from the first all accurately, in an orderly manner to thee to write, O most excellent Theophilus,

4. that thou mayest know concerning which thou hast been taught of words the certainly.

5. Was in the days of Herod, the king of the Judea, a priest certain name Zacharias, of course of Abia; and the wife of him of the daughters of Aaron, and the name of her Elisabeth.

6. They were and righteous both in presence of the God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

7. And not was to them a child, because the Elisabeth was barren, and both having been advanced in the days of them were.

8. It happen now in the to perform sacred rites him in the order of the course of him before of the God,

9. according to the custom of the priesthood it fell to his lot of the to burn incense, entering into the temple of the Lord;

10. and whole the multitude was of the people praying without to the hour of the incense burning.

11. Appeared and to him a messenger of a Lord, standing at right of the altar of the incense.

12. And was troubled Zacharias seeing, and fear fell upon him.

13. Said but to him the messenger: Not fear, Zacharias; because has been heard the prayer of thee, and the wife of thee Elisabeth shall bear a son to thee; and thou shalt call the name of him John.

14. And he shall be a joy to thee and exultation, and many at the birth of him shall be glad.

15. He shall be for great in sight of a Lord; and wine and strong drink not not he may drink; and a spirit of holy shall be filled yet out of womb of mother of himself.

16. And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to a Lord the God of them.

17. And he shall precede in the sight of him in spirit and power of Elias, to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient by wisdom of just (ones), to make ready for a Lord a people having been prepared.

18. And said Zacharias to the messenger: By what shall I know this? I for am an old man, and the wife of me far advanced in the days of herself.

19. And answering the messenger said to him: I am Gabriel, the having attended in presence of the God; and I am sent to speak to thee, and to tell glad tidings to thee these.

20. And lo, thou shalt be having been dumb, and not being able to speak, till which day may be done these; because of which not thou hast believed the words of me, which shall be fulfilled into the season of them.

21. And was the people waiting for the Zacharias; and wondering in the to delay him in the temple.

22. Coming out but not he was able to speak to them; and they perceived, that a vision he has been in the temple; and he was making signs to them, and remained dumb.

23. And it happened as were filled the days of the ministration of him, he went to the house of himself.

24. After and these the days conceived Elisabeth the wife of him; and hid herself months five, saying:

25. That thus to me has done the Lord in days, which he looked on to take away the reproach of me among men.

26. In now the month the sixth was sent the messenger Gabriel by the God to a city of the Galilee, to which a name Nazareth,

27. to a virgin having been betrothed to a man, to whom a name Joseph, of house of David; and the name of the virgin, Mary.

28. And coming the messenger to her, said: Hail, having been favored; the Lord with thee. having been blessed thou among women.

29. She but at the word was greatly agitated, and pondered, what could be the salutation this.

30. And said the messenger to her: Not fear, Mary; thou hast found for favor with the God.

31. And lo, thou shalt conceive in womb, and shalt bear a son, and thou shalt call the name of him Jesus.

32. This shall be great, and a son of highest he shall be called; and shall give to him a Lord the God the throne of David the father of him;

33. and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages, and of the kingdom of him not shall be and end.

34. Said but Mary to the messenger: How shall be this, since a man not I know?

35. And answering the messenger said to her: A spirit holy shall come upon thee, and a power of highest shall overshadow thee; therefore and the being begotten holy, shall be called a son of God.

36. And lo, Elisabeth the kinswoman of thee, even she having conceived a son in old age of her; and this month sixth is to her the being called barren.

37. For not shall be impossible with the God every word.

38. Said and Mary: Lo, the handmaid of a Lord; may it be done to me according to the word of thee. And went from her the messenger.

39. Arising and Mary in the days those, she went into the hilly country with haste, into a city of Juda.

40. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted the Elisabeth.

41. And it happened, as heard the Elisabeth the salutation of the Mary, leaped the babe in the womb of her; and was filled a spirit of holy the Elisabeth, and she cried out with a voice great and said:

42. Having been blessed thou among women; and having been blessed the fruit of the womb of thee.

43. And whence to me this, that should come the mother of the Lord of me to me?

44. Lo for, as came the voice of the salutation of thee into the ears of me, leaped the babe in exultation in the womb of me.

45. And happy she having believed, that shall be a fulfillment to those having been told to her from a Lord.

46. And said Mary: Magnifies the soul of me the Lord,

47. and has exulted the spirit of me in the God the savior of me;

48. for he looked upon the low state of the handmaid of himself. Lo for, from the now will call happy me all the generations;

49. for has done to me great things the mighty one; and holy the name of him,

50. and the mercy of him to generations of generations to those fearing him.

51. He has showed strength with arm of himself; he has dispersed arrogant ones in thought of hearts of them.

52. He has cast down mighty ones from thrones, and lifted up humble ones.

53. Hungering one he filled of good things, and being rich be sent away empty.

54. He aided Israel a child of himself, to remember mercy.

55. (as he spoke to the fathers of us), to the Abraham and to the seed of him even to an age.

56. Abode and Mary with her about months three; and returned to the house of her.

57. To the now Elisabeth was fulfilled the time of the to bear her; and she brought forth a son.

58. And heard the neighbors and the kindred of her, that had magnified a Lord the mercy of himself towards her; and they rejoiced with her.

59. And it came to pass, in the eight day they came to circumcise the little child; and called it, after the name of the father of him, Zacharias.

60. And answering the mother of him said: No; but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her: That no one is among the kindred of thee, who is called to the name this.

62. They made signs then to the father of him, the what he would desire to be called him.

63. And having requested a tablet, he wrote, saying: John is the name of him. And they wondered all.

64. Was opened and the mouth of him immediately, and the tongue of him and he spoke blessing the God.

65. And came on all a fear those dwelling around them; and in whole the hillycountry of the Judea talked of through out all the things these.

66. And placed all those having heard in the heart of themselves, saying: What then the child this will be? And hand of Lord was with him.

67. And Zacharias the father of him was filled a spirit of holy, and prophesied, saying:

68. Blessed Lord, the God of the Israel; for he was visited and wrought redemption to the people of himself,

69. and raised up a horn of salvation to us in the house of David the servant of himself

70. (even as he spoke through mouth of the holy ones, of those from age, of prophets of himself);

71. a salvation from enemies of us, and from hand of all those hating us;

72. to perform mercy with the fathers of us, and to remember covenant holy of himself,

73. an oath, which he swore to Abraham the father of us, of the to give to us,

74. without fear, from hand of the enemies of us having been rescued, to worship him

75. in holiness and righteousness in presence of him, all the days of us.

76. And thou, little child, a prophet of highest shalt be called; thou shalt go for before face of a Lord, to prepare ways of him,

77. of the to give knowledge of salvation to the people of him, in forgiveness of sins of them,

78. on account of tender mercies of God of us, by which he has visited us a rising from on high

79. to shine to those in darkness and shade of death sitting, of the to guide the feet of us into a way of peace.

80. The now little child grew, and became strong in spirit; and was in the deserts, till day of manifestation of him to the Israel.

## Luke 2

1. It came to pass and in the days those, went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, to register all the habitable.

2. (This the registry first was made being governor of the Syria Cyrenius.)

3. And they went all to be registered, each into the his own city.

4. Went up and also Joseph from the Galilee, out of city Nazareth, into the Judea, into a city of David, which is called Bethleem, (because the to be him of house and family of David,)

5. to be registered with Mary the having been espoused to him a wife, being with child.

6. It happened but in the to be them there, were fulfilled the days of the to bear her.

7. And she brought forth the son of her the firstborn, and swathed him, and laid him in the manger; because not was to them a place in the guestchamber.

8. And shepherds were in the country the this abiding in the fields, and keeping watches of the night over the flock of them.

9. And lo, a messenger of a Lord stood near to them, and glory of a Lord shone round them; and they feared a fear great.

10. And said to them the messenger: Not fear you; lo for, I bring glad tidings to you a joy great, which shall be to all the people;

11. that was born to you today a savior, who is Anointed, Lord, in a city of David.

12. And this to you the sign: You shall find a babe having been swathed lying in a manger.

13. And suddenly was with the messenger a multitude of host of heaven, praising the God, and saying:

14. Glory in highest heavens to God, and on earth peace; among men good will.

15. And it came to pass, when went from them into the heaven the messengers, and the men, the shepherds, said to one another: We should go now to Bethleem, and see the thing this the having been done, which the Lord has made known to us.

16. And they came having made haste, and they found the both Mary and the Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.

17. Having seen and, they published around the declaration that having been told to them concerning the little child this.

18. And all those having heard wondered about those having been told by the shepherds to them.

19. The but Mary all kept the words these, pondering in the heart of herself.

20. And returned the shepherds glorifying and praising the God for all which they had heard and seen, even it had been told to them.

21. And when were fulfilled days eight of the to circumcise him, and he was called the name of him Jesus, that being called by the messenger before of the was conceived him in the womb.

22. And when were fulfilled the days of the purification of them, according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present to the Lord,

23. (as it is written in law of Lord: That every male opening a womb, holy to the Lord shall be called);

24. and of the offer a sacrifice, according to that having been said in law of Lord: A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.

25. And lo, was a man in Jerusalem, to whom a name of Simeon; and the man this just and pious, waiting for consolation of the Israel. And a spirit was holy upon him,

26. and it was to him having been informed by the spirit of the holy, not to see death, before he should see the Anointed of Lord.

27. And he came by the spirit into the temple; and in the to bring the parents the little child Jesus, of the to do them according to that having been instituted of the law concerning him;

28. also he took it into the arms of himself, and blessed the God, and said:

29. Now dost thou dismiss the servant of thee, O Sovereign, according to the word of thee, in peace;

30. for have seen the eyes of me the salvation of thee,

31. which thou hast prepared before face of all the people;

32. a light for a revelation of nations, and a glory of people of thee Israel.

33. And was the father of him and the mother wondering at those being spoken about him.

34. And blessed them Simeon, and said to Mary the mother of him: Lo, this is placed for a fall and rising of many in the Israel, and for a sign being spoken against;

35. (also of thee and of thyself the soul shall pierce through a sword); so that may be disclosed of many hearts reasonings.

36. And was Anna a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of tribe of Aser; she having been advanced in days many, having lived years with a husband seven from the virginity of herself;

37. also she a widow about years eightyfour, who not withdrew from the temple, fastings and prayers serving night and day.

38. And she, this the hour standing by, acknowledged the Lord, and spoke about him to all those looking for redemption in Jerusalem.

39. And when they finished all the things according to the law of Lord, they returned into the Galilee, into the city of themselves, Nazareth.

40. The and little child grew, and was strengthened in spirit being filled with wisdom; and favor of God was on it.

41. And went the parents of him every year to Jerusalem of the feast of the passover.

42. And when he was years twelve, having gone up of them to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast;

43. and having ended the days, in the to return them, remained Jesus the boy in Jerusalem; and not knew Joseph and the mother of him.

44. Having supposed and him in the company to be, they went of a day a journey, and they sought him among the kinsmen and the acquaintances.

45. And not finding, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.

46. And it happened, after days three they found him in the temple sitting in middle of the teachers, and hearing of them, and asking them.

47. Were amazed and all those hearing him, upon the understanding and the answers of him.

48. And seeing him, they were amazed; and to him the mother of him said: O child, why hast thou done to us thus? lo, the father of thee and I being in distress have sought thee.

49. And he said to them: Why for did you seek me? not know you, that in the of the father of me must to be me?

50. And they not understood the word, which he spoke to them.

51. And he went down with them, and came into Nazareth; and was being subject to them. And the mother of him treasured all the words these in the heart of herself.

52. And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and in vigor, and in favor with God and men.

## Luke 3

1. In year now fifteenth of the government of Tiberius Caesar, being governor Pontius Pilate of the Judea, and being tetrarch of the Galilee Herod, Philip and the brother of him being tetrarch of the Ituria and Trachonitis region, and Lysanias of the Abilene being tetrarch,

2. under highpriests Annas and Caiaphas, came a word of God to John, the of Zacharias son, in the desert.

3. And he went into all the country about the Jordan, preaching a dipping of reformation into a forgiveness of sins;

4. as it is written in a book of words of Esaias the prophet, saying: A voice crying in the desert; Make you ready the way of a Lord, straight make you the beaten tracks of him.

5. Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and shall be the crooked into straight; and the rough into ways smooth;

6. and shall see all flesh the salvation of the God.

7. He said then to those coming out of crowds to be dipped by him: O broods of venomous serpents, who pointed out to you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Bring forth then fruits worthy of the reformation; and not you should begin to say in yourselves: A father we have the Abraham. I say for to you, that is able the God out of the stones of these to rise up children to the Abraham.

9. Now and even the axe to the root of the trees is placed; every therefore tree not bearing fruit good, is cut down, and into the fire is cast.

10. And asked him the crowds, saying: What then should we do?

11. Answering and he says to them: He having two tunics, let him share with the not having; and he having meats, in like manner let him do.

12. Came and also taxgathers to be dipped, and said to him: O teacher, what should we do?

13. He said to them: Nothing more from that having been appointed to you collect you.

14. Asked and him also soldiers, saying: And we what should we do? And he said to them: No one may you extort from, neither may you accuse wrongfully; and be you content with the wages of you.

15. Expecting and of the people, and reasoning all in the hearts of them about the John, whether he were the Anointed,

16. answered the John to all saying: I indeed in water dip you; comes but the mightier of me, of whom not I am worthy to loose the strap of the sandals of him; he you will dip in spirit holy and fire.

17. Of whom the winnowing shovel in the hand of him, and he will thoroughly cleanse the floor of him; and he will gather the wheat into the storehouse of himself, the but chaff he will burn up in fire inextinguishable.

18. Many indeed then also other things exhorting he preached glad tidings the people.

19. The but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him about Herodias of the wife of the brother of him, and about all of which had done evils the Herod,

20. added also this to all, and shut up the John in the prison.

21. It occurred and in the to have been dipped all the people, and Jesus having been dipped and praying, to have been opened the heaven,

22. and to descend the spirit the holy in a bodily form, like a dove, upon him, and a voice out of heaven to have come saying Thou art the son of me the beloved in thee I delight.

23. And he was the Jesus about years thirty, beginning, being, as was allowed, a son of Joseph, of the Heli,

24. of the Matthat, of the Levi, of the Melchi, of the Janna, of the Joseph,

25. of the Mattathias, of the Amos, of the Naoum, of the Esli, of the Naggai,

26. of the Maath, of the Mattathias, of the Semei, of the Joseph, of the Juda,

27. of the Joanna, of the Rhesa, of the Zorobabel, of the Salathiel, of the Neri,

28. of the Melchi, of the Addi, of the Cosam, of the Elmodam, of the Er,

29. of the Jose, of the Eliezer, of the Jorem, of the Matthat, of the Levi,

30. of the Simon, of the Juda, of the Joseph, of the Jonan, of the Eliakim,

31. of the Melea, of the Mainan, of the Mattatha, of the Nathan, of the David,

32. of the Jesse, of the Obed, of the Booz, of the Salmon, of the Naasson,

33. of the Aminadab, of the Aram, of the Esrom, of the Phares, of the Juda,

34. of the Jacob, of the Isaac, of the Abraham, of the Thara, of the Nachor,

35. of the Serouch, of the Ragau, of the Phalec, of the Eber, of the Sala,

36. of the Cainan, of the Arphaxad, of the Sem, of the Noah, of the Lamech,

37. of the Mathusala, of the Enoch, of the Jared, of the Malaleel, of the Cainan,

38. of the Enos, of the Seth, of the Adam, of the God.

## Luke 4

1. Jesus and spirit of holy full returned from the Jordan; and was led about by the spirit into the desert,

2. days forty being tempted by the accuser. And not he ate nothing in the days those; and being ended of them, afterwards he was hungry.

3. And said to him the accuser: If a son thou art of the God, say to the stone this, that it may become a loaf.

4. And answered Jesus to him, saying: It is written: That not on bread alone shall live the man, but on every word of God.

5. And having led up him the accuser into mountain high, he showed to him all the kingdom of the habitable in a moment of time.

6. And said to him the accuser: To thee I will give the authority this all, and the glory of them; that to me it has been prepared, and to whoever I will, I give her;

7. thou then if thou wilt do homage before me, shall be to thee all.

8. And answering to him said the Jesus: It is written: Thou shalt worship a Lord the God of thee, and to him alone thou shalt render service.

9. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the wing of the temple; and said to him: If a son thou art of the God, cast thyself from this place down.

10. It is written for: That to the messengers of himself he will give charge concerning thee, of the to guard thee;

11. and that on hands they shall bear thee, lest thou shouldst strike against a stone the foot of thee.

12. And answering said to him the Jesus: That it is said: Not thou shalt tempt a Lord the God of thee.

13. And having ended every temptation the accuser, departed from him for a season.

14. And returned the Jesus in the power of the spirit into the Galilee; and a report went out through whole the surrounding region about him.

15. And he taught in the synagogues of them, being glorified by all.

16. And he came into the Nazareth, where he was having been brought up; and entered, according to the custom to him in the day of the sabbaths, into the synagogue; and stood up to read.

17. And was delivered to him a roll of Esaias the prophet; and having unrolled the roll, he found the place, where it was having been written:

18. A spirit of a Lord upon me; of which on account of he has anointed me to publish glad tidings to poor ones, he has sent me to publish to captives a deliverance, and to build ones recovery of sight, to sent away those having been crushed in freedom,

19. to publish a year of a Lord acceptable.

20. And having rolled up the roll, having given back to the attendant, he sat down; and of all in the synagogue the eyes were looking steadily to him.

21. He began and to say to them: That today is fulfilled that writing this in to the ears of you.

22. And all bore testimony to him, and wondered at the words of the graciousness, those proceeding out of the mouth of him, and said: Not this is the son of Joseph?

23. And he said to them: Surely you will say to me the illustration this: Physician, heal thyself; what things we have heard having been done in Capernaum, do thou also here in the country of thee.

24. He said and: Indeed I say to you, that no one a prophet acceptable is in the country of himself.

25. In truth but I say to you, many widows were in the days of Elias in the Israel, when was shut up the heaven for years three and months six, so that came a famine great over all the land;

26. and to no one of them was sent Elias, if not into Sarepta of the Sidon to a woman a widow.

27. And many lepers were in of Elisha the prophet in the Israel; and no one of them were cleansed, if not Naaman the Syrian.

28. And they were filled all of wrath in the synagogue, having heard these things.

29. And rising up they cast out him outside of the city; and they led him even to a brow of the mountain, on which the city of them was built, so as to cast down him;

30. he but passing through midst of them, went away.

31. And he came down into Capernaum, a city of the Galilee; and he was teaching them in the sabbaths.

32. And they were astonished on the teaching of him; for with authority was the word of him.

33. And in the synagogue was a man having a spirit of a demon unclean, and he cried out with a voice loud,

34. saying: Ah, what to us and to thee, Jesus O Nazarene? comest thou to destroy us; I know thee who thou art, the holy of the God.

35. And rebuked him the Jesus, saying: Be silent, and come out out of him. And having thrown him the demon into midst, came out of him, nothing hurting him.

36. And came amazement on all; and talked to one another, saying: What the word this, for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out?

37. And went forth a report concerning him into every place of the country around.

38. Having risen up and out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon; motherinlaw and of the Simon was seized with fever great; and they asked him about her.

39. And standing above her, he rebuked the fever; and it left her. Forthwith and rising up she served them.

40. Setting and of the sun, all as many as had being afflicted with disease various, brought them to him; he and one by one separately of them the hands having placed, he healed them.

41. Came out and also demons from many, crying out and saying: That thou art the son of the God. And rebuking not he permitted them to say, that they knew the Anointed him to be.

42. Being come and day, coming out he went into a desert place; and the crowds sought him, and came to him, and urged him not to depart from them.

43. He but said to them: That also to the other cities to publish glad tidings me must the kingdom of the God; because for this I have been sent forth.

44. And he was preaching in the synagogue of Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. It happened but in to the the crowd to press him of the to hear the word of the God, and he was standing by the lake Gennesaret;

2. and he saw two ships standing by the lake; the but fisherman having gone from them, were washing the nets.

3. Entering and into one of the ships, which was of the Simon; he asked him from the land to put off a little; and sitting down he taught out of the ship the crowds.

4. When and he ceased speaking, he said to the Simon: Put out into the deep, and let down the nets of you for a draught.

5. And answering the Simon said to him: O master, through whole of the night having toiled, nothing we have taken; at but the word of thee I will let down the net.

6. And this having done, they enclosed a multitude of fishes great; was rending and the net of them.

7. And they beckoned to the partners of those in the other ship, of the coming to help them; and they came, and filled both the ships, so as to sink them.

8. Seeing and Simon Peter, fell down to the knees to the Jesus, saying: Depart from me, for a man a sinner I am, O lord.

9. Amazement for seized him and all those with him, at the draught of the fishes, which they had taken.

10. In like manner and also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with the Simon. And said to the Simon the Jesus: Not fear; from of the now men thou will be catching.

11. And having brought the ships to the land, having left all, they followed him.

12. And it happened in to the to be him in one of the cities, and lo, a man full of leprosy; and seeing the Jesus, having fallen on face, entreated him saying: O lord, if thou wilt, thou art able me to cleanse.

13. And stretching out the hand, he touched him, saying: I will, be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And he commanded him no one to tell: but going show thyself to the priest, and offer on account of the cleansing of thee, as enjoined Moses, for a witness to them.

15. Spread abroad but more the word concerning him; and came together crowds great to hear, and to be healed by him from the weakness of them;

16. He but was retiring in the deserts, and praying.

17. And it happened in one of the days, and he was teaching; and were sitting Pharisees and teachers of the law, they were having come out of all villages of the Galilee and Judea, and Jerusalem; and power of Lord was into the to heal them.

18. And lo, men bringing on a couch a man, who was having been palsied; and sought him to bring in, and to place in presence of him.

19. And not finding how they might bring in him, through the crowd, having gone up to the roof, through the tiles they let down him with the little bed into the midst in presence of the Jesus.

20. And seeing the faith of them, he said: O man, have been forgiven to thee the sins of thee.

21. And began to reason the scribes and the Pharisees, saying: Who is this who speaks blasphemies? who is able to forgive sins, if not alone the God?

22. Knowing but the Jesus the reasonings of them, answering said to them: Why do you reason in the hearts of you?

23. Which is easier to say: Have been forgiven to thee the sins of thee? or to to say: Arise and walk?

24. That but you may know, that authority has the son of the man on the earth to forgive sins, (he said to the having been palsied:) To thee I say: Arise, and having taken up the little bed of thee, go into the house of thee.

25. And instantly arising in presence of them, having taken up on which he had been laid, went into the house of himself, glorifying the God.

26. And amazement too all, and they glorified the God; and were filled of fear; saying: That we have seen wonderful things today.

27. And after these he went out, and saw publican with a name Levi, sitting at the customhouse; and he said to him: Follow me.

28. And forsaking all rising up he followed him.

29. And made a feast great Levi to him in the house of himself; and was a crowd of publicans great, and of others, who were with them reclining.

30. And murmured the scribes of them and the Pharisees to the disciples of him, saying: Why with the publicans and sinners do you eat and drink?

31. And answering the Jesus said to them: No need have those being in health of a physician, but those sick being;

32. not I have come to call just (ones), but sinners to reformation.

33. They and said to him: Why the disciples of John fast often, and prayers make, in like manner and those of the Pharisees; those but to thee eat and drink?

34. He said to them: Not you are able the sons of the bridalchamber, in which the bridegroom with them is, to make to fast?

35. Will come but days, and when may be taken from them the bridegroom, then they will fast in those the days.

36. He spoke and also a parable to them: That no one a patch of a mantle new sews to a mantle old; if nut not, and the new it rends and the old not agrees a patch that from the new.

37. And no one puts wine new into skins old; if but not, will burst the new wine the skins, and he will be split, and the skins will be destroyed;

38. but wine new into skins new requires to be put; and both are preserved.

39. And no one having drink old, immediately desires new; he says for: The old better is.

## Luke 6

1. It happened and in sabbath secondfirst to pass him through the grainfields; and plucked the disciples of him the ears of grain, and ate, rubbing the hands.

2. Some and of the Pharisees said to them: Why do you, which not it is lawful to do in the sabbath?

3. And answering to them said the Jesus: Not even this have you read, what did David, when he was hungry he and those with him being?

4. how he entered into the house of the God, and the loaves of the presence he took, and ate, and gave also to those with him; which not it is lawful to eat, if not alone the priests?

5. And he said to them: That a lord is the son of the man also of the sabbath.

6. It happened and also in another sabbath to enter him into the synagogue, and to teach; and was there a man, and the hand of him the right was withered.

7. Watched and him the scribes and the Pharisees if in the sabbath he will heal, so that they might find an accusation of him.

8. He but knew the purposes of them, and said to the man the withered having the hand: Arise and stand into the midst. He and having arisen stood.

9. Said then the Jesus to them: I will ask you: What is it lawful to the sabbath? to do good or to do evil? a life to save, or to kill?

10. And looking around on all them, he said to him: Stretch out the hand of thee. He and did; and was restored the hand of him as the other.

11. They and were filled madness, and they talked to one another, what they should do to the Jesus.

12. It came to pass and in the days those, he went out into the mountain to pray; and was passing the night in the place of prayer of the God.

13. And when it came day, he called to the disciples of himself; and having chosen from them twelve, whom also apostles he named;

14. (Simon, whom also he named Peter, and Andrew the brother of him, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the of the Alpheus, and Simon the being called Zelotes,

16. Judas of James and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor);

17. and descending with them, he stood on a place level, and a crowd of disciples of him, and a multitude great of the people from all of the Judea, and Jerusalem, and of the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed from the diseases of themselves;

18. and those being troubled from spirits unclean; and they were healed.

19. And all the crowd sought to touch him; for a power from him went out, and healed all.

20. And he having lifted up the eyes of himself on the disciples of himself, he said: Blessed the poor; for yours is the kingdom of the God.

21. Blessed the hungering now; for you shall be satisfied. Blessed the weeping now; for you shall laugh.

22. Blessed are you, when may hate you the men, and when they may separate you, and they may revile, and may cast out the name of you as evil, on account of the son of the man.

23. Rejoice you in that the day, and leap you for joy; lo for, the reward of you great in the heaven; according to these for did to the prophets the fathers of them.

24. But woe to you the rich; for you have in full the comfort of you.

25. Woe to you, those having been filled; for you shall hunger. Woe to you, those laughing now; for you shall mourn and you shall weep.

26. Woe, when well you may speak the men; according to these for did to the falseprophets the fathers of them.

27. But to you I say to those hearing: Love you the enemies of you; good do you to those hating you;

28. bless you those cursing you; pray you for those traducing you.

29. To the striking thee on the creek, offer also the other; and from the taking of thee the mantle, also the tunic not thou mayest hinder.

30. To all and those asking thee give thou; and from the taking what is thine, not demand back.

31. And all you wish, that may do to you the men, also you do you to them in like manner.

32. And if you love those loving you, what to you thanks is it? and for sinners those loving them love.

33. And if you should do good those doing good you, what to you thanks is it? also for the sinners the same do.

34. And if you should lend from whom you hope to receive, what to you thanks is it? also for the sinners to sinners lead, that they may receive the like things.

35. But love you the enemies of you, and do you good and lend you nothing departing; and shall be the reward of you great, and you shall be sons of highest; for he kind is to the unthankful and evil.

36. Be you therefore compassionate, even as also the Father of you compassionate is.

37. And not judge you, and not not you may be judged; not condemn you, and not not you may be condemned; release you, and you shall be released.

38. Give you, and it shall be given to you; measure good having been pressed down and having been shaken and running over shall be given into the bosom of you; by the for same measure, with which you measure, it shall be measured again to you.

39. He spoke and a parable to them: Not is able a blind blind to lead? not both into a pit will fall?

40. Not is a disciple over the teacher of himself; having been fully qualified but every one shall be as the teacher of him.

41. Why and seest thou the splinter that in the eye of the brother of thee, the but beam that in thine own eye not perceivest?

42. or how art thou able to say to the brother of thee: O brother, allow me, I can cast out the splinter that in the eye of thee; thyself the in the eye of thee beam not beholding? O hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of the eye of thee, and then thou wilt see clearly to cast out the splinter that in the eye of the brother of thee.

43. Not for is a tree good, bearing fruit corrupt; nor a tree corrupt, bearing fruit good.

44. Every for tree from the own fruit is know; not fore from thorns do they gather figs, nor from a bramble do they pick a cluster of grapes.

45. The good man out of the good treasure of the heart of himself brings forth the good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of the heart of himself brings forth the evil; out of for the fulness of the heart speaks the mouth of him.

46. Why and me do you call, O lord, O lord; and not do what I say?

47. All the coming to me, and hearing of me the words, and doing them, I will show to you, to whom he is like.

48. Like he is to a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock; of a flood and having come, dashed against the stream the house that, and not was able to shake her; it was founded for upon the rock.

49. He but having heard, and not having done, like he is to a man having built a house on the earth without a foundation; to which dashed against the stream; and immediately it feel, and became the ruin of the house that great.

## Luke 7

1. When and he had ended all the words of him in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

2. Of a centurion and certain slave sick being, was about to die, who was to him valuable.

3. Having heard about the Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him, that coming he would save the slave of himself.

4. They and having come to the Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying: That worthy he is, for whom thou wilt confer this;

5. he loves for the nation of us, and the synagogue he built for us.

6. The and Jesus went with them. Already and of him not far being distant from the house, sent to him the centurion friends, saying to him: O sir, not be thou troubled; not for I am worthy, that under the roof of me thou shouldst enter;

7. therefore not even myself I deemed fit to thee to come; but speak a word, and will be healed the boy of me.

8. Even for I am a man am under authority being set, having under myself soldiers; and I say to this: Go, and he goes; and to another: Come, and he comes; and to the slave of me: Do this, and he does.

9. Hearing and these the Jesus, admired him; and turning, to the following him crowd he said: I say to you, not even in the Israel so great faith I have found.

10. And having returned those having been sent into the house, they found the being sick slave being well.

11. And it happened in the next, he was going to a city being called Nain; and were going with him the disciples of him many and a crowd great.

12. As and he drew near to the gate of the city, and lo, was being carried out a dead man, a son only born to the mother of himself, and she a widow; and a crowd of the city great was with her.

13. And seeing her the Lord, he had compassion of her, and said to her: Not weep.

14. And coming up he touched the bier; and those and bearing stood still. And he said: O young man, to thee I say, rise.

15. And sat up dead, and began to speak; and he gave him to the mother of him.

16. Seized and a fear all, and they glorified the God, saying: That a prophet great has risen among us, and that has visited the God the people of himself.

17. And went out the word this in whole the Judea concerning him, and in all the surrounding country.

18. And told John the disciple of him about all these.

19. And having called two certain of the disciples of himself the John, sent to the Jesus, saying: Thou art the coming one, or another are we to look for?

20. Having come and to him the men they said: John the dipper has sent us to thee, saying: Thou art the coming one, or another are we to look for?

21. In this and the hour he delivered many from diseases and plagues and spirits evil, and to blind ones many he gave the to see.

22. And answering the Jesus said to them: Going away relate to John what you have seen and heard; that blind ones see again, lame ones are walking about, lepers are cleansed, deaf ones are hearing, dead ones are raised up, poor ones are addressed with glad tidings;

23. and blessed is, whoever not may be stumbled in me.

24. Having departed and the messengers of John, he began to say to the crowds concerning John: What have you come out into the desert to see? a reed by wind being shaken?

25. But what have you come out to see? a man in soft garments having been clothed? Lo, those in clothing showy and in luxury living in the royal places are.

26. But what have you come out to see? a prophet? Yes I say to you, and much more of a prophet?

27. This is, concerning whom it is written: Lo, I send the messenger of me before face of thee, who shall prepare the way of thee in presence of thee.

28. I say for to you; a greater among offspring of women prophet of John the dipper not is; the but less in the kingdom of the God, greater of him is.

29. And all the people having heard, and the taxgatherers, justified the God, having been dipped the dipping of John.

30. The but Pharisees and the lawyers the purpose of the God set aside for themselves, not having been dipped by him.

31. To what then shall I compare the men of the generation this? and to what are they like?

32. Like they are boys those in a market sitting, and calling to one another, and saying: We have played the flute for you and not you have danced; we have mourned for you, and not you have wept.

33. Has come for John the dipper, neither bread eating, nor wine drinking; and you say: A demon he has.

34. Has come the son of the man, eating and drinking; and you say: Lo, a man glutton and winedrinker, a friend of taxgatherers and sinners.

35. And is justified the wisdom by the children of herself all.

36. Asked and one him of the Pharisees, that he might eat with him; and entering into the house of the Pharisee, he reclined.

37. And lo, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, knowing that he reclines in the house of the Pharisee, having brought an alabaster box of balsam,

38. and standing behind at the feet of him, weeping, she began to wet the feet of him with the tears; and with the hairs of the head of herself wiped, and kissed the feet of him, and anointed with the balsam.

39. Seeing but the Pharisee that having called him, spoke in himself, saying: This if he was a prophet, would know, who and what the woman, who touches him; that a sinner she is.

40. And answering the Jesus said to him: Simon, I have to thee something to say. He and says: O teacher, say.

41. Two debtors were to a creditor certain; the one owed denarii five hundred, the and other fifty.

42. Not having and of them to pay, both he forgive. Which then of them, say more him will love?

43. Answering and the Simon said: I suppose that to whom the more he forgave. He and said to him: Rightly thou hast judged.

44. And turning to the woman, to the Simon he said: Seest thou this the woman? I came of thee into the house; water for the feet of me not thou gavest; she but with the tears she wet of me the feet, and with the hairs of herself was wiped.

45. A kiss to me not thou gavest; she but from of her came in, not has ceased kissing for me the feet.

46. With oil the head of me not thou didst anoint; she but with balsam anointed the feet of me.

47. Therefore, I say to thee, have been forgiven the sins of her the many, for that she loved much; to whom but little is forgiven, little he loves.

48. He said and to her: Have been forgiven to thee the sins.

49. And began those reclining with to say in themselves: Who this is, who even sins forgives?

50. He said and to the woman: The faith of thee has saved thee; go in peace.

## Luke 8

1. And it happened in the afterwards, also he traveled through every city and village, publishing and proclaiming the glad tidings the kingdom of the God; and the twelve with him,

2. and women certain, who were having been healed from spirits evil and infirmities; Mary that being called Magdalene, from whom demons seven has gone out,

3. and Joanna, a wife of Chuza a steward of Herod, and Susanna, and others many, who ministered to him from the possessions of them.

4. Was assembling and a crowd great, and of the every city were coming to him, he said by a parable:

5. Went out the sower of the sow the seed of himself; and in the sowing it, this indeed fell by the path; and it was trodden down, and the birds of the heaven ate it.

6. And another fell on the rock; and having sprung up it dried up, through the not to have moisture.

7. And another fell in midst of the thorns; and having sprung up with the thorns they chocked it.

8. And another fell in the ground the good; and having sprung up bore fruit a hundredfold. These things having said, he cried: He having ears to hear, let him hear.

9. Asked and him the disciples of him, saying what may be the parable this.

10. He and said: To you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of the God; to the but others in parables; that seeing not they may see, and hearing not they may understand.

11. Is now this the parable: The seed, is the word of the God.

12. Those and by the path, are those hearing; then comes the accuser, and takes away the word from the heart of them, so that not having believed they may be saved.

13. They and on the rock, who, when they may hear, with joy receives the word; and these a root not they have, who for a season will believe, and in a season of temptation fall away.

14. That and into the thorns having fallen, these are they having heard, and by anxious cares and riches and pleasures of the life going forth are choked, and not bear fruit to perfection.

15. That and in the ground, these are, who in heart good and upright having heard the word, retain, and bear fruit with perseverance.

16. No one and a lamp having lighted, covers him with a vessel, or under a couch places; but upon a lampstand places, that those entering may see the light.

17. Not for is hidden, which not manifest will become; nor stored away, which not will be known and into light may come.

18. Take heed then, how you hear; who for ever may have, it will be given to him; and whoever not may have, even what he seems to have, will be taken from him.

19. Came and to him the mother and the brothers of him, and not was able to get near him on account of the crowd.

20. And it was told to him, saying: The mother of thee and the brothers of thee stand without to see thee desiring.

21. He and answering said to them: Mother of me and brothers of me these are, who the word of the God hearing and doing.

22. And it happened in one of the days, and he he went into a ship, and the disciples of him; and said to them: We may pass over to the other side of the lake; and they put off.

23. Sailing but of them, he fell asleep. And came down a squall of wind on the lake, and they were filling, and were in danger.

24. Coming to and they awoke him, saying: O master, O master, we are perishing. He and arising rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. He said and to them: Where is the faith of you? Fearing and they wondered, saying to one another: Who then this is, that even to the winds he gives a charge and to the water, and they hearken to him?

26. And they sailed into the country of the Gadarenes, which is overagainst the Galilee.

27. Going out and to him on the land, met him a man certain out of the city, who had demons from times many, and a mantle not he put on, and in a house not he remained, but in the tombs.

28. Seeing and the Jesus, and crying out, he fell down to him, and with a voice loud he said: What to me and to thee, Jesus, O son of the God of the highest? I beseech thee, not me thou mayest torment.

29. (He had commanded for the spirit the unclean to come out from the man; many for times it had seized him; and he was bound with chains and fetters, being guarded; and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.)

30. Asked and him the Jesus, saying: What to thee is a name? He and said: Legion; for demons many had entered into him.

31. And he besought him, that not he would command them into the abyss to go.

32. Was and there a herd of swine many feeding in the mountain; and they besought him, that he would permit them into them to enter. And he permitted them.

33. Having gone out and the demons from the man, they entered into the swine; and rushed the herd down the precipice into the lake, and were chocked.

34. Seeing and those feeding that having been done, fled and reported in the city and in the villages.

35. They came out and to see that having been done; and came to the Jesus, and found sitting the man, from whom the demons had gone out, having been clothed and being of sane mind, at the feet of the Jesus; and they were afraid.

36. Reported and to them and those having seen, how was saved he having been demonized.

37. And asked him whole the multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes, to go from them; for with a fear great they were seized. He and having gone into the ship, returned.

38. Begged and of him the man, from whom had gone out the demons, to be with him. Sent away but him the Jesus, saying:

39. Return to the house of thee, and relate, how much has done to thee the God. And he went away, through whole the city publishing, how much had done to him the Jesus.

40. It happened and in the to return the Jesus, gladly received him the crowd; they were for all waiting for him.

41. And lo, came a man, to whom a name Jairus, and he a ruler of the synagogue was; and falling at the feet of the Jesus, besought him to come into the house of himself;

42. for a daughter only was to him about years twelve, and she was dying. In and to the to go him, the crowds pressed him.

43. And a woman being in a flow of blood from years twelve, who with physicians having expended whole the living, not had strength by any one to be cured;

44. coming behind, touched the tuft of the mantle of him; and immediately stopped the flow of the blood of her.

45. And said the Jesus: Who the having touched me? Denying and all, said the Peter and those with him: O master, the crowds press on thee and crowd; and sayest thou: Who the having touched me?

46. The and Jesus said: Touched me some one; I for know a power went out from me.

47. Seeing and the woman, that not she was unnoticed trembling came, and falling down to him, through what cause she touched him, related to him in presence of all of the people, and how she was cured immediately.

48. He and said to her: Take courage, O daughter; the faith of thee has saved thee; go in peace.

49. While of him speaking, comes some one from of the synagoguerulers, saying to him: That is dead the daughter of thee; not trouble thou the teacher.

50. The but Jesus having heard, answered him, saying: Not fear; only believe you, and she shall be saved.

51. Coming and in to the house, not he suffered to enter no one, except Peter and John and James, and the father of the child and the mother.

52. Was weeping and all, and lamenting her. He but said: Not weep you; not she is dead, but sleeps.

53. And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.

54. He but having put out all, and having grasped the hand of her, called out, saying: The child, arise.

55. And returned the breath of her, and she stood up immediately. And he commanded to her to be given to eat.

56. And were astonished the parents of her. He but charged them no one to tell that having been done.

## Luke 9

1. Having called together and the twelve, he gave to them power and authority over all the demons, and diseases to cure.

2. And he sent them to publish the kingdom of the God, and to heal those being sick.

3. And said to them: Nothing take you for the journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor silver; nor each two coats to have.

4. And into whatever house you may enter, there remain, and thence depart.

5. And whoever not may receive you, coming out from the city that, even the dust from the feet of you shake off, for a testimony against them.

6. Coming forth and they traveled through the villages, publishing glad tidings and healing everywhere.

7. Heard and Herod the tetrarch that being done by him all; and he was perplexed, because the to be said by some, that John has been raised out of dead;

8. by some and, that Elias had appeared; others and, that a prophet one of the ancients has stood up.

9. And said Herod: John I beheaded; who but is this, concerning whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.

10. And having returned the apostles related to him what things they had done; and taking them he withdrew by himself into a place desert of a city being called Bethsaida.

11. The and crowds having heard, they followed him. And having received them, he spake to them concerning the kingdom of the God, and those need having of healing, he cured.

12. The now day began to decline; coming and the twelve, said to him: Dismiss the crowd, that having gone into the surrounding villages and the farms, they may lodge, and find provisions; for here in a desert place we are.

13. He said but to them: Give to them you to eat. They and said: Not are to us more then five loaves, and fishes two, if not going we may buy for all the people this food.

14. They were for about men five thousand. He said and to the disciples of himself: Make recline them in companies each fifty.

15. And they did so, and they made recline all.

16. Taking and the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to the heaven, he blessed them; and broke and gave to the disciples, to set before the crowd.

17. And they ate, and were satisfied all; and was taken up that having been left to them of fragments, baskets twelve.

18. And it happened in the to be him praying in private, came to him the disciples; and he asked them, saying: Who me say the crowd to be?

19. They and answering, said: John the dipper; others but, Elias, others and, that a prophet one of the ancients has stood up.

20. He said and to them: You but who me say you to be? Answering and the Peter said: The Anointed of the God.

21. He and having strictly charged them, commanded to no one to tell this,

22. saying: That must the son of the man many things to suffer, and to be rejected by the elders and highpriests and scribes and to be killed, and the third day to be raised.

23. He said and to all: If any one wishes after me to come, let him deny himself, and let him bear the cross of himself every day, and follow me.

24. Who for ever may wish the life of himself to save, shall lose her; who but ever may lose the life of himself on account of me, he shall save her.

25. What for is profited a man having won the world whole, himself and having lost, or having forfeited?

26. Who for ever may be ashamed me and the my words, this the son of the man will be ashamed, when he may come in the glory of himself, and of the Father, and of the holy messengers.

27. I say but to you truly, are some of those here standing, who not not shall taste of death, till they may see the royal majesty of the God.

28. It happened and after the words these, about days eight, and having taken Peter and John and James, he went up into to mountain to pray.

29. And it occurred, in the to pray him, the form of the face of him, different, and the raiment of him whiteness flashing forth.

30. And lo, men two were talking with him, who were Moses and Elias;

31. they appearing in glory, spoke of the departure of him, which he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem.

32. The but Peter and those with him were having been heavy with sleep. Having awakened but they saw the glory of him, and the two men those standing with him.

33. And it happened in the to depart them from him, said the Peter to the Jesus: O master, good it is us here to be; and we may make tents three, one for thee and one for Moses, and one for Elias; not knowing what he says.

34. These and of him saying, came a cloud, and overshadowed them, they feared and in the those to enter into the cloud.

35. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is the son of me the beloved; him hear you.

36. And in the to have been the voice, was found the Jesus alone. And they were silent, and to no one told in those the days nothing of what they had seen.

37. I t happened and in the next day, having come down them from the mountain, met him a crowd great.

38. And lo, a man from the crowd cried loudly, saying: O teacher, I pray thee, to look on the son of me, for onlyborn he is to me;

39. and lo, a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and convulses him with foam, and hardly departs from him, bruising him.

40. And i besought the disciples of thee, that they might expel it; and not they were able.

41. Answering and the Jesus said: O generation without faith and having been perverted; till when shall I be with you, and bear with you? Lead the son of thee here.

42. While and coming to him, dashed down him the demon, and violently convulsed. Rebuked and the Jesus the spirit the unclean, and healed the child, and delivered him to the father of him.

43. Were amazed and all at the majesty of the God. All and were wondering on all which did the Jesus, he said to the disciples of himself:

44. Place you into the ears of you the words these; the for son of the man is about to be delivered into hands of men.

45. They but understood not the word this, and it was having been veiled from them, that not they might perceive it; and they feared to ask him concerning the word this.

46. Arose and a dispute among them, that, which would be greater of them.

47. The Jesus perceiving the though of the heart of them, having taken a little child, placed it near himself, and said to them:

48. Whoever may receive this the little child in the name of me, me receives; and whoever me may receive, receives the having sent me. He for less among all you being he shall be great.

49. Answering and the John said: O master, we saw one in the name of thee casting out the demons; and we forbade him, because not he follows with us.

50. And said to him the Jesus: Not forbid you; who for not is against you, for you is.

51. It came to pass and in the to be completed the days of the withdrawing of him, and he the face of himself firmly set of the to go to Jerusalem.

52. And he sent messengers before face of himself; and having gone they entered into a village of Samaritans, so as to prepare to him.

53. And not they received him, because the face of him was going to Jerusalem.

54. Seeing and the disciples of him, James and John, said: O Lord, wilt thou we speak fire to come down from the heaven, and to consume them, as even Elias did?

55. Turning and he rebuked them, and said: Not you know, of what spirit are you?

56. And they went to another village.

57. It happened and going of them in the way, said one to him: I will follow thee, whenever thou mayest go, O master.

58. And said to him the Jesus: The foxes dens have, and birds of the heaven roots; the but son of the man not has, where the head he may rest.

59. He said and to another: Follow me. He but said: O master, permit thou me having gone first to bury the father of me.

60. Said and to him the Jesus: Leave the dead ones to bury the of themselves dead ones; thou and having gone publish the kingdom of the God.

61. Said and also another I will follow thee, O master; first but permit thou me to bid farewell to those in the house of me.

62. Said but to him the Jesus: No one having put the hand of himself on a plough, and looking for the things behind, welldisposed is for the kingdom of the God.

## Luke 10

1. After but these things appointed the Lord also others seventy, and sent them each two before face of himself into every city and place, where was about he to go.

2. He said then to them: The indeed harvest great, the but laborers few; implore therefore the lord of the harvest, that he would send out laborers into the harvest of himself.

3. Go you; lo, I send you as lambs in midst of wolves.

4. Not carry you a purse, nor a bag nor sandals; and no one by the way salute.

5. Into what and ever house you may enter, first you say: Peace to the house this.

6. And if may be there a son, of peace, shall rest on him the peace of you; if but not, on you it shall return.

7. In this and the house remain, eating and drinking the things with them; worthy for the laborer if the reward of himself is. Not go you from house to house.

8. Also into what and ever city you may enter, and they may receive you, eat you the things being set before you,

9. and cure you those in her sick, and say you to them: Has come nigh to you the kingdom of the God.

10. Into what but ever city you may enter, and not they may receive you, going out into the wide places of her say you:

11. Even the dust, that cleaving to us from the city of you, we wipe off for you; however this know you, that has approached the kingdom of the God.

12. I say to you, that for Sodom in the day that more tolerable it will be than the city that.

13. Woe to thee, Chorazin, woe to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the miracles, those being done in you, long ago would in sackcloth and ashes sitting they have reformed.

14. But for Tyre and Sidon more tolerable it will be in the judgment, than for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, which even to the heaven art being exalted, even to invisibility down shalt be brought.

16. He hearing you, me hears; and he rejecting you me rejects; he and me rejecting, rejects the one sending me.

17. Having returned and the seventy with joy, saying: O lord, and the demons are subject to us in the name of thee.

18. He said and to them: I beheld the adversary as lightning out of the heaven having fallen.

19. Lo, I give to you the authority of the to tread on serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy; and nothing you not not may hurt.

20. But in this not rejoice, that the spirits to you are subject; rejoice you but, that the names of you are written in the heavens.

21. In this the hour exulted the spirit the Jesus, and said: I praise thee, O father, O lord of the heaven and the earth, that thou hast hid these things from wise men and discerning men, and thou hast revealed them to babes; yes, the Father, for even so it was good in presence of thee.

22. All to me are given by the Father of me; and no one knows, who is the son if not the Father; and who is the Father, if not the son, and to whom may be willing the son to reveal.

23. And turning to the disciples, privately he said: Blessed the eyes, those seeing, what you see.

24. I say for to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see, what you see, and not saw; and to hear, what you hear, and not heard.

25. And lo, a lawyer certain stood up, tempting him, and saying: O teacher, what shall I do life agelasting I may inherit?

26. He and said to him: In the law what has been written? how readest thou?

27. He and answering said: Thou shalt love Lord the God of thee out of whole of the heart of thee, and out of whole of the soul of thee, and out of whole of the strength of thee, and out of whole of the mind of thee; and the neighbor of thee as thyself.

28. He said and to him: Rightly thou hast answered; this do, and thou shalt live.

29. He but choosing to justify himself, said to the Jesus: And who is of me a neighbor?

30. Replying and the Jesus said: A man certain was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and robbers fell among; who both stripping him and blows having inflicted, they departed, leaving half dead being.

31. By chance and a priest certain was going down in the way that, and seeing him, passed along.

32. In like manner and also a Levite, having come near the place, coming and seeing, passed along.

33. A Samaritan but certain traveling, came near him, and seeing him, he was moved with pity.

34. And having approached he moved the wounds of him, pouring on oil and wine; having set and him on the own beast led him to an inn, and he took care of him.

35. And on the next day having come out, having taken out two denarii he gave to the inn keeper, and said to him: Take care of him; and whatever thou mayest expend more, I, in the return me, I will pay to thee.

36. Which then of them of the three a neighbor seems to thee to have been to the having fallen among the robbers?

37. He and said: He having shown the pity towards him. Said and to him the Jesus: Go, and thou do in like manner.

38. It happened and in the to go them, and he entered into a village certain a woman and certain to a name Martha, received him, into the house of herself.

39. And to her was a sister having been called Mary, who and having sat at the feet of the Jesus, heard the word of him.

40. The but Martha wasoverbusied about much serving; having come near and said: O lord, not concerns thee, that the sister of me alone me has left to serve? say then to her, that to me she may give aid.

41. Answering and said to her the Jesus: Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things;

42. of one but is need. Mary and the good part has chosen, which not shall be taken away from her.

## Luke 11

1. And it happened in the to be him in a place certain praying, when he ceased, said one of the disciples of him to him: O lord, teach us to pray, as even John taught the disciples of himself.

2. He said and to them: When you pray, say: O Father, be hallowed the name of thee; let come of thee the kingdom;

3. the bread of us the necessary give thou to us the every day;

4. And for give to us the sins of us, even for ourselves forgive all owing us; and not thou mayest lead us into temptation.

5. And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him: O friend, lend to me three loaves;

6. because a friend of me has come from way to me, and not I have what I shall set for him.

7. And he from within answering should say: Not to me trouble do thou cause; already the door has been shut, and the children of me with me in the bed are; not I am able having arisen to give to thee.

8. I say to you, if and not will give to him having arisen, because the to be of him a friend, through indeed the importunity of him arising he will give to him as many as he wants.

9. And I to you say: Ask you, and it shall be given to you; seek you, and you shall find; knock you, and it shall be opened to you.

10. All for the asking receives; and the seeking finds; and to the knocking it shall be opened.

11. Which now of you the father shall ask the son bread, not a stone will give to him? or also a fish, not in place of a fish a serpent will give to him?

12. or also if he may ask an egg, not will give to him a scorpion?

13. If then you, evil being, know you gifts good to give to the children of you, how much more the Father that of heaven, will give a spirit holy to those asking him?

14. And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; it came to pass and of the demon having come out, spake the dumb; and wondered the crowds.

15. Some but of them said: By Beelzebul, a ruler of the demons, he cast out the demons;

16. other but tempting, a sign from him sought from heaven.

17. He He but knowing of him the thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom, against herself having been divided, is brought to desolation, and house upon house fails.

18. If and also the adversary against himself has been divided, how shall stand the kingdom of him? for you say, by Beelzebul to cast out me the demons.

19. If but I by Beelzebul cast out the demons, the sons of you by whom do they cast out? Through this judges of you they shall be.

20. If but by a finger of God I cast out the demons, then has suddenly come upon you the royal majesty of the God.

21. When the strong one having been armed should he guard the of himself a palace, in peace are the possessions of him;

22. as soon as but the stronger of him having entered should overcome him, the arms of him takes away, in which he had confided, and the spoils of him distributed.

23. He not being with me, against me is; and he not gathering with me, scatters.

24. When the unclean spirit may come out from the man, passes through dry places, seeking a resting place; and not finding, says: I will return into the house of me, whence I came out.

25. And having come it finds having been swept and having been adorned.

26. Then it goes and takes with seven other spirits more evil of itself, and they having entered dwell there; and becomes the last of the man that worse of the first.

27. It happened and in to the to speak him these things, having lifted certain woman a voice out of the crowd, said to him: Blessed the womb that having carried thee, and breasts those thou hast sucked.

28. He but said: Yes rather blessed those hearing the word of the God, and observing.

29. The and crowds gathering together, he began to say: The generation this evil is; a sign it seeks; and a sign not shall be given to her, except the sign of Jonas.

30. Even as for became Jonas a sign to the Ninevites, so will be also the son of the man, to the generation this.

31. A queen of South will be raised in the judgment with the men of the generation this, and will condemn them; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, a greater of Solomon here.

32. Men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this, and will condemn her; because they reformed at the preaching of Jonas; and lo, a greater of Jonas here.

33. No one and a lamp having lighted, into a secret place places, neither under the cornmeasure, but on the lampstand, that those entering the light may see.

34. The lamp of the body is the eye; when therefore the eye of thee sound may be, also whole the body of thee enlightened is; when but evil may be, also the body of thee darkened.

35. Take heed therefore, not the light that in thee darkness is.

36. If therefore the body of thee whole is enlightened, not having any part dark, will be enlightened whole, as when the lamp by the brightness may enlighten thee.

37. In and the to have spoken, asked him a Pharisee certain that he might dine with him. Having entered and he reclined.

38. The and Pharisee seeing wondered, because not first he was dipped before the dinner.

39. Said and the Lord to him: Now you the Pharisees the outside of the cup and of the platter you cleanse; the but inside of you is full of extortion and of evil.

40. O unwise, not he having made the outside, also the inside made?

41. But the things being within give you alms; and lo, all things clean to you is.

42. But woe to you the Pharisees, for you tithe the mint, and the rue, and every potherb; and you pass by the justice and the love of the God. These things you ought to have done, and those not to omit.

43. Woe to you the Pharisees, for you love the first seat in the synagogues, and the salutations in the markets.

44. Woe to you, for you are like the tombs those unseen, and the men, those walking over, not know.

45. Answering and one of the lawyers says to him: O teacher, these things saying also us thou reproachest.

46. He and said: Also to you the lawyers woe, for you load the men burdens oppressive, and yourselves with one of the fingers of you not you touch the burdens.

47. Woe to you, for you build the tombs of the prophets, the and fathers of you killed them.

48. Therefore you testify and you consent to the works of the fathers of you; for they indeed killed them, you and build of them the tombs.

49. Because of this and the wisdom of the God said: I will send to them prophets and apostles, and out of them they will kill and persecute;

50. so that may be required the blood of all of the prophets, that being shed from a laying down of a world, from the generation this;

51. from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zecharias that having perished between the altar and the house. Yes I say to you, it will be required from the generation this.

52. Woe to you the lawyers, for you took away the key of the knowledge; yourselves not you entered, and those entering you hindered.

53. Saying and of him these things to them, began the scribes and the Pharisees greatly to be incensed, and to make speak offhand him about many things; trying to entrap him, seeking to each something out of the mouth of him, that they might accuse him.

## Luke 12

1. In those having been assembled of the myriads of the crowd, so as to tread upon one another, he began to say to the disciples of himself: First take heed to yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. Nothing and having been covered is, which not shall be uncovered; and secret, which not shall be known.

3. On which account what in the dark you speak, in the light shall be heard; and what to the ear you spoke in the closets, shall be published on the housetops.

4. I say and to you the friends of me: Not you be afraid of those killing the body, and after these not having more anything to have done.

5. I will point out and to you, whom you should fear; you should fear the after the to have killed, authority having to cast into the gehenna; yes I say to you, this fear you.

6. Not five sparrows are sold assarii two? and one out of them not is being forgotten in presence of the God.

7. But also the hairs of the head of you all have been numbered. Not therefore fear you; many sparrows you are better.

8. I say and to you: All whoever may confess to me in presence of the men, also the son of the man will confess in him in presence of the messengers of the God.

9. He but having denied me in presence of the men, will be denied in presence of the messengers of the God.

10. And all who shall speak a word against the son of the man, it will be forgiven to him; to the but against the holy spirit having spoken evil not will be forgiven.

11. When and they may bring you to the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, not be you anxious, how or what you may answer, or what you may say;

12. the for holy spirit will teach you in this the hour, what it is proper to say.

13. Said and one to him out of the crowd: O teacher, speak to the brother of me to divide with me the inheritance.

14. He and said to him: O man, who me appointed a judge or a divider over you?

15. He said and to them: See you and beware you of the covetousness; because not in the to abound any one the life of him is out of the possessions of him.

16. He spoke and a parable to them, saying: A man certain rich yielded plentifully the farm.

17. And he reasoned in himself, saying: What shall i do? because not I have where I will gather the fruits of me.

18. And he said: This will do; I will pull down of me the barns, and greater I will build; and I will collect there all the products of me, and the fruits of me;

19. and I will say to the soul of me: Soul, thou hast many good things being laid up for years many; rest thou, eat, drink, be glad.

20. Said but to him the God: O unwise, this the night the life of thee they require from thee; what and thou hast prepared, for whom shall be?

21. Thus he laying up treasure for himself, and not for God being rich.

22. He said and to the disciples of himself: Through this to you I say, not be you anxious for the life of you, what you may eat; nor for the body, what you may put on.

23. The life greater it is of the food; and the body of the clothing.

24. Observe you the ravens, that not they sow, nor reap; for whom not is a storehouse, nor a barn; and the God feeds them. How much more you are valuable of the birds?

25. Which and of you being anxious is able to add to the age of himself span one?

26. If then not even least you are able why about the remaining ones are you anxious?

27. Observe you the lilies, how it grows; not it labors, nor it spins. I say but to you, not even Solomon in all the glory of himself was clothed like one of these.

28. If and the grass in the field, today existing and tomorrow into an oven is being cast, the God so clothes, how much more you, O you of weak faith?

29. And you not seek, what you may eat or what you may drink; and not be you in anxiety.

30. These for all the nations of the world seeks; of you and the Father knows, that you have need of these.

31. But seek you the kingdom of the God, and these all shall be superadded to you.

32. Not fear, the little flock; for it has pleased the Father of you to give to you the kingdom.

33. Sell you the possessions of you, and give you alms. Make for yourselves bags not growing old, a treasure exhaustless in the heavens, where a thief not approaches, nor moth destroys.

34. Where for is the treasure of you, there also the heart of you will be.

35. Let be of you the loins having been girded, and the lamps burning;

36. and you like to men looking for the lord of themselves, when he will return from the marriage feasts; that having come and having knocked, immediately it may be opened to him.

37. Blessed the salves those, whom having come the lord shall find watching; indeed i say to you, that he will grid himself, and will make to recline them, and going forth he will minister to them.

38. And if he may come in the second watch, and in the third watch they come, and may find thus; blessed are the slaves those.

39. This and know you, that, if had known the householder, in what hour the thief comes, he would watch, and not would allow to dig through the house of himself.

40. And you therefore be prepared; because, in the hour not you think, the son of the man comes.

41. Said and to him the Peter: O lord, to us the parable this thou sayest, or also to all?

42. Said and the Lord: Who then is the faithful steward, the wise, whom will appoint the lord over the domestics of himself the to give in season the measure of food?

43. Blessed the slave that, whom coming the lord of him will find doing thus.

44. Truly I say to you, that over all to the belonging of himself he will appoint him.

45. If but should say the slave that in the heart of himself: Delays the lord of me to come; and shall begin to strike the servants and maidens, to eat and also to drink and to be drunken;

46. will come the lord the slave that in a day, to which not he looks, an in an hour which not he knows; and shall cut a sunder him, and the part of him with the unbelievers will place.

47. That and the slave who having known the will of the lord of himself, and not having prepared, neither having done according to the will of him shall be beaten many;

48. he but not having known, having done and deserving of stripes shall be beaten few. To all and to whom is given much, much will be required from him; and to whom they have entrusted much, more they will ask him.

49. Fire i came to throw into the earth; and what do I wish, if already it were kindled.

50. A dipping and i have to be dipped; and how I am pressed, till may be finished.

51. Do you think, that peace I came to give in the earth? No, I say to you, but rather division.

52. Shall be for from the now five in a house one having been divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. Will be divided a father against a son, and a son against a father; a mother against a daughter, and a daughter against a mother; a motherinlaw against the daughterinlaw of herself, and a daughterinlaw against the motherinlaw of herself.

54. He said and also to the crowd: When you see the cloud rising from west, immediately you say: A shower comes; and it happens so.

55. And when south wind is blowing, you say: That burning heat shall be; and it happens.

56. O hypocrites, the face of the earth and of the heaven you know to discern; the but season this how not do you discern?

57. Why and even of yourselves not judge you the right?

58. When for thou goest with the opponent of thee to a ruler, in the way give thou labor to be set free from him; lest he may drag thee to the judge, and the judge thee may deliver to the officer, and the officer thee may cast into prison.

59. I say to thee, not not thou mayest come out thence, till even the last lepton thou hast paid.

## Luke 13

1. Were present and some in to him the season, reporting to him concerning the Galileans, of whom the blood Pilate mingled with the sacrifices of them.

2. And answering the Jesus said to them: Suppose you, that the Galileans these sinners above all the Galileans were, because such things they have suffered?

3. No, I say to you; but except you reform, all in like manner you will perish.

4. Or those the ten and eight, on whom fell the tower in the Siloam, and killed them, suppose you, that they offenders were above all men those dwelling in Jerusalem?

5. No, I say to you; but except you reform, all in like manner you will perish.

6. He spoke and this the parable: A figtree had one in the vineyard of himself having been planted; and came seeking fruit on her; and not found.

7. He said and to the vinedresser: Lo, three years came seeking fruit on the figtree this, and not find; cut down her; why and the earth it renders useless?

8. He and answering says to him: O lord, leave her also this the year, till I may dig about her, and I may put dung;

9. and if indeed it may bear fruit; if and not, in the future thou mayest cut down her.

10. He was and teaching in one of the synagogues in the sabbaths.

11. And lo, a woman was a spirit having of infirmity years ten and eight; and was being bent double, and not being able to raise up for the all time.

12. Seeing and her the Jesus, he called to, and said to her: O woman, thou hast been loosed of the infirmity of thee.

13. And he placed to her the hands; and immediately she stood erect, and glorified the God.

14. Answering and the synagogueruler, being angry, because in the sabbath healed the Jesus, he said to the crowd: Six days are, in which it is proper to work; in these therefore coming be you healed, and not in the day of the sabbath.

15. Answered therefore to him the Lord, and said: O hypocrites, each one of you in the sabbath not loose the ox of himself or the ass from the stall, and having led he drinks?

16. This and, a daughter of Abraham being, whom bound the adversary lo ten and eight years, not ought to be loosed from the bond this in the day of the sabbath?

17. And these things saying of him, were ashamed all the opponents to him; and all the crowd rejoiced for all the glorious things those being done by him.

18. He said and: To what like is the kingdom of the God? and to what shall I compare her?

19. Like it is a grain of mustard, which having taken a man he cast into a garden of himself; and it grew, and became into a tree great, and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches of it.

20. And again he said: To what shall I compare the kingdom of the of God?

21. Like it is to leaven, which having taken a woman mixed into of meal measures three, till was leavened whole.

22. And he passed throughout cities and towns, teaching, and went on making for Jerusalem.

23. Said and one to him: O lord, are few those being saved? He and said to them:

24. Agonize you to enter through the strait door; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter, and not will be able.

25. From when may be raised the householder, and may have shut the door, and you may begin without to stand, and to knock the door, saying: O lord, O lord, open thou to us; and answering he will say to you: Not I know you, whence you are.

26. Then you will begin to say: We are in presence of thee and in the wide places of us thou hast taught.

27. And he will say: I say to you, not I know you, whence you are; depart you from me all the workers of the wrong.

28. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth, when you may see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of the God, you and being cast outside.

29. And they will come from east and west, and from north and south; and will recline in the kingdom of the God.

30. And lo, they are last, who shall be first; and they are first, who will be last.

31. In this the day approached certain of Pharisees, saying to him: Come out, and go thou hence; for Herod wishes thee to kill.

32. And he said to them: Having gone say you to the fox this: Lo, I cast out demons and cures perform today and tomorrow, and in the third I shall have ended.

33. But it behooves me today and tomorrow and in the coming to go; for not it is possible a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem.

34. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killing the prophets, and stoning those having been sent to her, how often I desired to gather the children of thee, what manner a bird the of herself brood under the wings? and not you were willing.

35. Lo, is left to you the house of you, I say and to you, that not not you may see, till may come when you may say: Having been blessed he coming in name of Lord.

## Luke 14

1. And it happened in the to come him into a house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees in a sabbath to eat bread, and they were watching him.

2. And lo, a man certain was dropsical in presence of him.

3. And answering the Jesus said to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: If it is lawful in the sabbath to cure?

4. They but were silent. And having taken hold he cured him, and dismissed.

5. And answering to them said: Of any one of you an ass or an ox into a pit shall fall, and not immediately will draw out him in the day of the sabbath?

6. And not they were able to reply to him to these things.

7. He spoke and to those having been invited a parable, observing how the first reclining places they were choosing out, saying to them:

8. When thou mayest be invited by any one to marriagefeasts, not thou mayest recline in the first reclining place; least a more honorable of thee may be having been invited by him;

9. and coming he thee and him having invited, shall say to thee: Give thou to this a place; and then thou shouldst begin with shame the farthest place to occupy.

10. But when thou mayest be invited, having gone recline thou in the farthest place, that when may come he having invited thee, may say to thee: O friend, go thou up to a higher place. Then will be to thee glory in presence of those reclining with thee.

11. For every one the exalting himself, shall be humbled; and the humbling himself shall be exalted.

12. He said and also to the (one) having invited him: When thou mayest make a dinner or a supper, not call the friends of thee, nor the brethren of thee, nor the relations of thee, nor neighbors rich; lest also they thee should invite again, and be made to thee a recompense.

13. But when thou mayest make a feast, invite poor ones, maimed ones, lame ones, blind ones;

14. and blessed thou wilt be, because not they have to recompense to thee; it will be recompensed for to thee in the resurrection of the just.

15. Hearing and one of those reclining these, said to him: Blessed, who shall eat bread in the kingdom of the God.

16. He and said to him: A man certain made a supper great, and invited many.

17. And he sent the slave of himself in the hour of the supper to say to those having been invited: Come you, for now ready is all.

18. And they began from one to excuse themselves all. The first said to him: A field I bought, and I have need to go out and to see him; I beseech thee, have me having been excused.

19. And another said: Yokes of oxen I bought five, and I go to try them; I beseech the, have me having been excused.

20. And another said: A wife I married, and because of this not I am able to come.

21. And having come the slave that reported to the lord of himself these. Then being angry the householder said to the slave of himself: Go out quickly into the wide places and streets of the city, and the poor ones and maimed ones and lame ones and blind ones bring in hither.

22. And said the slave: O lord, it is done as thou didst order, and still room is.

23. And said the lord to the slave: Go out into the ways and hedges, and urge to enter, that may be filled the house of me.

24. I say for to you, that no one of the men those the having been invited shall taste of me the supper.

25. Were going and him crowds great; and turning he said to them:

26. If any one comes to me, and not hates the father of himself, and the mother, and the wife, and the children, and the brothers, and the sisters, still more and even the of himself life, not is able of me a disciple to be.

27. And whoever not bears the cross of himself, and comes after me, not is able of me to be a disciple.

28. Who for of you, wishing a tower to build, not first having sat down computes the cost, if he has to finish?

29. that lest having laid of him a foundation, and not being able to finish, all those beholding should begin to deride him,

30. saying: That this the man began to build, and not was able to finish.

31. Or what king going to engage with another king in battle, not having sat down first consult, if able he is with ten thousand to meet the (one) with twenty thousand coming against him?

32. If but not, while of him far off being, and embassy having sent, he asks the to peace.

33. So then all of you, who not bids farewell to all the of himself possessions not is able of me to be a disciple.

34. Good the salt; if but the salt should be tasteless, by what shall it be salted?

35. Neither for land, nor for manure fit it is; out they cast it. He having ears to hear, let him hear.

## Luke 15

1. Were and drawing near to him all the taxgathers and the sinners, to hear him.

2. And murmured the Pharisees and the scribes, saying: That this sinners receives, and eats with them.

3. He said and to them the parable this, saying:

4. What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, not leaves behind the ninetynine in the desert, and goes after that having been lost, till he may find it?

5. And having found, he lays on the shoulders of himself rejoicing;

6. and coming into the house he calls together the friends and the neighbors, saying to them: Rejoice with me, for I found the sheep of me that having been lost.

7. I say to you, that thus joy will be in the heaven over one sinner reforming, than over ninetynine just ones, who no need have of reformation.

8. Or what woman, drachmas having ten, if she may lose drachma one, not lights a lamp, and sweeps the house, and seeks carefully, till she finds?

9. And having found she calling together the friends and the neighbors, saying: Rejoice with me, for I found the drachma, which I lost.

10. Thus, I say to you, joy produced in presence of the messengers of the God over one sinner reforming.

11. He said and: A man certain had two sons.

12. And said to younger of them to the father: O father, give to me the falling to part of the property. And he divided to them the living.

13. And after not many days having gathered together all the younger son, went abroad into a country distant; and there wasted the property of himself, living dissolutely.

14. Having expended and of him all, came a famine mighty throughout the country that; and he began to be in want.

15. And having gone he united with one of the citizens of the country that; and he sent him into the fields of himself to feed swine.

16. And he longed to fill the belly of himself from the pods, which were eating the swine; and no one gave to him.

17. To himself and coming, he said: How many hired servants of the father of me have an abundance of bread? I and here with hunger am perishing.

18. Having arisen I will go the father of me, and will say to him: O father, I sinned against the heaven and in presence of thee;

19. no longer I am fit to be called a son of thee; make me as one of the hired servants of thee.

20. And having arisen he went to the father of himself. While but of him at a distance being, saw him the father of him, and was moved with pity; and running he fell on the neck of him and repeatedly kissed him.

21. Said and to him the son: O father, I sinned against the heaven and in presence of thee; and no longer I am fit to be called a son of thee.

22. Said but the father to the slaves of himself: Bring you out the robe the chief, and clothe you him, and give you a fingerring into the hand of him, and shoes for the feet.

23. And having brought the calf the fatted do you sacrifice; and eating we may be joyful;

24. for this the son of me dead was, and again alive; and having been lost he was, and is found. And they began to be merry.

25. Was and the son of him the elder in a field; and as he was coming near to the house, he heard a sound of music and dancers.

26. And having called to one of the servants, he inquired what may be these things?

27. He and said to him: That the brother of thee is come; and has sacrificed the father of thee the calf the fatted, because safe him he received.

28. He was angry and, and not was disposed to enter. The therefore father of him going out besought him.

29. He and answering said to the father: Lo, so many years do I slave for thee, and never a command of thee I passed by; and to me never thou gavest a kid, that with the friends of me I might be joyful.

30. When and the son of the this, the having devoured of thee the living with harlots, come, thou has sacrificed for him the calf the fatted.

31. He and said to him: O child, thou always with me art, and all the mine thine is.

32. To be joyful but and to be glad it is proper, for the brother of thee this dead was, and again is alive; and having been lost was, and is found.

## Luke 16

1. He said and also to the disciples of himself: A man certain was rich, who had a steward; and this was accused to him as wasting the possessions of him.

2. And having called him, he said to him: What this I hear concerning thee? render the account of the stewardship of thee; not for thou wilt be able longer to be steward.

3. Said and in himself the steward: What shall I do, for the lord of me takes the stewardship from me? To dig not I have strength, to beg I am ashamed.

4. I know what i will do, that, when I may be put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into the house of themselves.

5. And having summoned one each of the debtors of the lord of himself, he said to the first: How much owest thou to the lord of me?

6. He and said: A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him: Receive of thee the bill, and sitting down quickly write thou fifty.

7. Then to another he said: Thou and how much owest thou? He and said: A hundred cors of wheat. And he says to him: Receive of thee the bill, and write eighty.

8. And praised the lord the steward the unjust, because prudently he had done; for the sons of the age this more prudent above the sons of the light for the generation that of themselves are.

9. And I to you say: Make you to yourselves friends out of the mammon of the unjust; that, when you may fail, they may receive you into the agelasting tabernacles.

10. He faithful in least also in much faithful is; and he in least unjust, and in much unjust is.

11. If therefore in the unrighteous mammon faithful not you have been, the true who to you will entrust?

12. and if in the another faithful not you have been, the yours who to you will give?

13. No one domestic is able two lords to serve; either for the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or one he will cling to, and the other he will slight. Not you are able God to serve and mammon.

14. Heard and these all also the Pharisees, moneylovers being; and they mocked him.

15. And he said to them: You are those justifying yourselves in presence of the men; the but God knows the hearts of you; for that by men highly prized, an abomination in presence of the God.

16. The law and the prophets till John; from then the kingdom of the God is preached, and every one into her presses.

17. Easier but it is the heaven and the earth to pass away, than of the law one fine point to fail.

18. Every one who dismissing the wife of himself, and marrying another, commits adultery; and every one who her being divorced from an husband marrying, commits adultery.

19. A man now certain was rich, and was clothed purple and fine linen, feasting every day sumptuously.

20. A poor and certain was named Lazarus, who was laid at the gate of him being covered with sores,

21. and longing to be fed from the crumbs those falling from the table of the rich; but even the dogs coming licked the sores of him.

22. It happened and to die the poor, and to be borne away him by the messengers into the bosom Abraham. Died and also the rich, and was buried.

23. And in the unseen having lifted the eyes of himself, being in torment, sees the Abraham from a distance, and Lazarus in the bosoms of him.

24. And he crying out said: O father Abraham, do thou pity me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of the finger of himself of water, and may cool the tongue of me; for I am in pain in the flame this.

25. Said and Abraham: O child, remember, that thou didst receive the things good of thee in the life of the, and Lazarus in like manner the things bad; now but this is comforted, thou and art in pain.

26. And besides all these, between of us and of you a chasm great has been fixed, so that those wishing to pass over hence to you, not is able, nor those thence to us cross over.

27. He said then: I beseech then thee, O father, that thou wouldst send him to the house of the father of me;

28. I have for five brothers; that he may testify to them, that not also they may come into the place this of the torment.

29. Says to him Abraham: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

30. He and said: No, O father, Abraham; but if one from dead ones may go to them, they will reform.

31. He said but to him: If Moses and the prophets not they hear, neither if one out of dead one should rise, will they be convinced.

## Luke 17

1. He said and to the disciples: Impossible it is of the not to come the snares; woe but, through whom they come.

2. It is possible for him if a millstone upper was hung about the neck of him and have been thrown into the sea, than he should ensnare one of the little ones these.

3. Take heed to yourselves. If and should sin against thee the brother of thee, rebuke him; and if he should reform, forgive him.

4. And if seven times of the day he should sin against thee, and seven times of the day he should turn, saying: I reform; thou shalt forgive him.

5. And said the apostles to the Lord: Do thou add to us faith.

6. Said and the Lord: If you had faith as a grain of mustard, you might say to the sycaminetree this: Be thou uprooted, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.

7. Which but of you a slave having ploughing or feeding cattle, who having come out of the field will say: Immediately going do thou recline?

8. But not will say to him: Make ready what I may sup, and having girded do thou serve me, till I may eat and drink; and after these shalt eat and drink thou?

9. Not favor has the slave that, because he did the things having been commanded? No I think.

10. So also you, when you shall have done all the things having been commanded you, say you: That slaves unprofitable we are; because what we were bound to do, we have done.

11. And it happened in the to go him to Jerusalem, and he passed through midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And entering of him into a certain village, met him ten leprous men, who stood far off.

13. And they lifted up a voice, saying: Jesus master pity us.

14. And seeing he said to them: Going show you yourselves to the priests. And it happened in the to go them, they were cleansed.

15. One and of them, saying that he was cured turned back, with a voice loud glorifying the God;

16. and fell on face at the feet of him, giving thanks to him; and he was a Samaritan.

17. Answering and the Jesus said: Not the ten were cleansed? the but nine where?

18. Not they found having returned to give glory to the God, except the foreigner this?

19. And he said to him: Arising go thou; the faith of thee has saved thee.

20. Having been asked and by the Pharisees, when comes the kingdom of the God, he answered them, and said: Not comes the kingdom of the God with careful watching;

21. nor will they say: Lo here, or, or there; lo for, the majesty of the God in the midst of you is.

22. He said and to the disciples: Will come days, when you will desire one of the days of the son of the man to see; and not you will see.

23. And they will say to you: Lo here, or, lo there; not you may go away, nor may you follow.

24. Even as for the lightening, that flashing out of the under heaven, to the under heaven shines; so will be the son of the man in the day of him.

25. First but it behooves him many things to suffer, and to rejected from the generation this.

26. And as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the son of the man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till of which day entered Noah into the ark; and came the flood, and destroyed all.

28. In like manner also as it happened in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;

29. in the but day went out Lot from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed all;

30. according to these it will be in the day the son of the man is revealed.

31. In that the day, who will be on the roof, and the goods of him in the house, not let him descend to take them; and he in the field, in like manner not let him turn for the things behind.

32. Remember you of the wife of Lot.

33. Whoever may seek the life of himself to save will lose her; and whoever may lose her, will preserve her.

34. I say to you: In this the night will be two on bed one; one will be taken, and the other will be left.

35. Two will be grinding on the same; the one will be taken, and the other will be left.

36. And answering they said to him: Where, O Lord? He and said to them: Where the body, there will be gathered the eagles.

## Luke 18

1. He spoke and also a parable to them, in order that ought always to pray, and not to be weary,

2. saying: A judge certain was in a certain city, the God not fearing, and man not regarding.

3. A widow and was in the city that; and she went to him, saying: Do justice me from the opponent of me.

4. And not he would for a time. Afterwards but these he said in himself: If even the God not I fear, and man not I regard;

5. through the to render to me trouble the window this, I will do justice her; that not to end coming she should pester me.

6. Said and the Lord: Hear you, what the judge the unjust says.

7. The and God not not will do the justice for the chosen ones of himself those crying to him day and night, and bearing long towards them?

8. I say to you, that he will do the justice for them in an instant. But the son of the man coming indeed will he find the faith on the earth?

9. He spoke and also to some those trusting in themselves that they are just ones, and despising the others, the parable this:

10. Men two went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a taxgather.

11. The Pharisee, standing by himself, these he prayed: The God, I give thanks to thee, that not I am like the others of the men, plunders, unjust ones, adulterers, or even like this the taxgatherer.

12. I fast twice of the week, I tithe all what I acquire.

13. And the taxgather at a distance having been standing not would not even the eyes to the heaven lift up; but he smote on the breast of himself, saying: The God, be propitious to me the sinner.

14. I say to you, went down this having been justified to the house of himself, or for that; for every one the exalting himself, will be humbled; he but humbling himself, will be exalted.

15. They brought and to him also the infants, that them he might touch; seeing and the disciples rebuked them.

16. The but Jesus calling to them, he said: Allow the little children to come to me, and not forbid them; for the because such like is the kingdom of the God.

17. Indeed I say to you, who ever not may receive the kingdom of the God as little child, not not may enter into her.

18. And asked certain him ruler, saying: O teacher good, what shall I do life agelasting to inherit?

19. Said and to him the Jesus: Why me callest thou good? no one good, if not one, the God.

20. The commandments thou knowest: Not thou mayest commit adultery not thou mayest kill; and not thou mayest steal; not thou mayest bear false testimony; honor the father of thee, and the mother of thee.

21. He and said: These all I observed from youth of me.

22. Having heard and these the Jesus, said to him: Yet one to thee is wanting; all what thou hast sell, and give thou to poor ones, and thou shalt have a treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

23. Her and having heard these, greatly grieved became; he was for rich exceedingly.

24. Seeing and him the Jesus greatly grieved becoming, said: How with difficulty those the riches having shall enter into the kingdom of the God.

25. Easier for it is, a camel through hole of a needle to enter, than a rich man into the kingdom of the God to enter.

26. Said and those having heard: And who is able to be saved?

27. He but said: The things impossible with men, possible is with the God.

28. Said and the Peter: Lo, we left all and followed thee.

29. He and said to them: Indeed I say to you, that no one is who left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, on account of the kingdom of the God,

30. who not not may receive many times more in the season this, and in the age the coming life agelasting.

31. Having taken and the twelve, he said to them: Lo, we go to Jerusalem, and will be finished all the having been written through the prophets in the son of the man.

32. He will be delivered up for to the Gentiles, and will be derided, and will be shamefully treated, and will be spit on;

33. and having been scourged they will kill him; and the day the third he will stand up.

34. And they not one of these understood; and was the thing this having been hidden from them, and not they knew the things being spoken.

35. It happened and in the to draw nigh him to Jericho, a blind man certain sat by the way begging.

36. Hearing and a crowd passing along, he asked, what may be this?

37. They told and him, that Jesus the Nazarene passes by.

38. And he shouted, saying: Jesus, O son of David, pity me.

39. And those going before rebuked him, that he might be silent. He but much more cried out: O son of David, pity me.

40. Stopping and the Jesus commanded him to be led to himself. Having come and of him, he asked him,

41. saying: What for thee desirest I should do? He and said: O lord, that I may see again.

42. And the Jesus said to him: See thou again; the faith of thee has saved thee.

43. And instantly he saw again, and followed him, glorifying the God; and all the people seeing, gave praise to the God.

## Luke 19

1. And having entered he passed through the Jericho.

2. And lo, a man for a name being called Zaccheus; and he was a chief taxgatherer, and this was rich.

3. And he sought to see the Jesus, who he is; and not was able on account of the crowd, for the stature little was.

4. And running before, he went up on a sycamore, that he might see him; for that he was about to pass by.

5. And as he came to the place, having looked the Jesus saw him, and said to him: O Zaccheus, having hastened descend thou; today for in the house of thee must me to abide.

6. And having hastened he came down, and he received him rejoicing.

7. And seeing all murmured, saying: That with a sinner a man he went in to lodge.

8. Standing up but Zaccheus said to the Lord: Lo, the half of the possessions of me, O lord, I give to the poor; and if of any one any thing I extorted I give back fourfold.

9. Said and to him the Jesus: That today salvation to the house this has come; since also he a son of Abraham is;

10. came for the son of the man to seek and to save that having been lost.

11. Hearing and of them these things proceeding he spoke a parable, because the near him to be Jerusalem, and to think them, that immediately is about the kingdom of the God to appear.

12. He said therefore: A man certain wellborn went into a country distant, to receive for himself royal dignity, and to return.

13. Having called and ten slaves of himself, he gave to them ten minas, and he said to them: Do you business till I come.

14. The but citizens of him hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying: Not we are willing this to reign over us.

15. And it happened in the to return him having received the royal dignity, and ordered to be called to himself the slave those, to whom he gave the silver; that he might know, what each had gained by trading.

16. Came and the first, saying: O lord, the mina of thee has gained ten minas.

17. And he said to him: Well, O good slave; because in least faithful thou hast been, be thou authority having over ten cities.

18. And came the second, saying: O lord, the mina of thee has made five minas.

19. He said and also to this: Also thou be over five cities.

20. And another came saying: O lord, lo the mina of thee, which I had being laid up in a napkin.

21. I feared for thee, because a man harsh thou art; thou takest up, what not thou didst lay down, and thou reapest, what not thou didst sow.

22. He says and to him: Out of the mouth of thee I will judge thee, O evil slave; thou knowest, that I a man harsh am, taking up what not I laid down, and reaping what not I sowed.

23. And why not thou gavest the silver of me on the table, and I coming with interest might have exacted it?

24. And to those having stood by he said: Take you from him the mina, and give you to the the ten minas having.

25. (and they said to him: O lord, he has ten minas.)

26. I say for to you that to every one the having will be given; from but of the not having, even what he has, will be taken from him.

27. But the enemies of me those, the not willing me to reign over them, bring you hither and slay in presence of me.

28. And having said these, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And it happened as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mountain the being called of olivetrees, he sent two of the disciples of himself,

30. saying: Go you into the overagainst village; in which entering you will find a colt having tied, on which no one ever of men sat; having loosed him bring you.

31. And if any one you may ask: Why do you loose? thus say you to him: That the lord of him need has.

32. Having gone and those having been sent found, as he said to them.

33. Loosing and of them the colt, said the lords of him to them: Why loose you the colt.

34. They and said: The lord of him need has.

35. And they led him to the Jesus; and having thrown of themselves the mantles on the colt, they set on the Jesus.

36. Going and of him, they spread under the mantles of them in the way.

37. Drawing near and of him now to the descent of the mountain of the olivetrees, began all the multitude of the disciples rejoicing to praise the God with a voice loud for all which they saw mighty works,

38. saying: Worthy of blessing the coming king in name of Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in highest.

39. And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: O teacher, rebuke the disciples of thee.

40. And answering he said to them: I say to you, that if these should be silent, the stones will cry out.

41. And as he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over her, saying:

42. That if thou hadst known even thou, at last in the day of thee this, the things to peace of thee; now but it is hidden from eyes of thee.

43. For will come days on this, and will throw around the enemies of thee a rampart to thee, and will surround thee, and will press thee on every side;

44. and will level with the ground thee, and the children of thee in thee, and not they will leave in thee a stone on a stone; because of which not thou knowest the season of the visitation of thee.

45. And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those selling in it and buying,

46. saying to them: It is written: The house of me a house of prayer is; you but it made a den of robbers.

47. And he was teaching the everyday in the temple; the and highpriests and the scribes sought him to destroy, and the chief ones of the people.

48. And not finding that what they might do; the people for all were very attentive him hearing.

## Luke 20

1. And it happened in one of the days those was teaching of him the people in the temple, and preaching glad tidings, stood by the highpriests and the scribes with the elders,

2. and said to him, saying: Say to us, by what authority these things doest you? or who is he having given to thee the authority this?

3. Answering and he said to them: Will ask you also I one word, and say you to me.

4. The dipping of John from heaven was, or from men?

5. They and reasoned among themselves, saying: That if we would say: From heaven he will say: Why then not did you believe him?

6. If and we should say: From men; all the people will stone us; having been persuaded for it is, John a prophet to be.

7. And they answered not to have known whence.

8. And the Jesus said to them: Neither I tell to you, by what authority these I do.

9. He began and to the people to say the parable this: A man planted a vineyard and let out it to husbandmen; and went abroad times many.

10. And in season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that from of the fruit of the vineyard they might give to him; the but husbandmen, having beaten him, sent away empty.

11. And he proceeded to send another slave; they but also this having beaten and having dishonored, sent away empty.

12. And he proceeded to send a third; they but also this having wounded cast out.

13. Said and the lord of the vineyard: What shall I do? I will send the son of me the beloved; perhaps this seeing they will regard.

14. Seeing but him the husbandmen, they reasoned with themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, we may kill him, that to us may be the inheritance.

15. And casting him out of the vineyard, they killed. What then will do to them the lord of the vineyard?

16. He will come and will destroy these husbandmen those, and give the vineyard to others. Having heard and they said: Not let it be.

17. He but, having looked to them, he said: What then is that having been written this: A stone which rejected of builders, this has been made into a head corner?

18. All the falling upon that the stone, will be bruised; on whom but it may fall, will grind to power him.

19. And sought the highpriests and the scribes to put on him the hands in this the hour; but they feared the people; they knew for, that to them the parable this he spoke.

20. And having watched they sent spies, feigning themselves righteous to be; that they might lay hold of him of a word, in order to the to deliver up him to the rule and to the authority of the governor.

21. And they asked him, saying: O teacher, we know, that rightly thou speakest and thou teachest, and not thou dost accept a countenance, but in truth the way of the God thou teachest.

22. Is it lawful for us to Caesar tax to give, or not?

23. Perceiving but to them the craftiness, he said to them: Why me tempt you?

24. Show you to me a denarius; of whom has it a likeness and inscription? Answering and they said: Of Caesar.

25. He and said to them: Give you back then the things of Caesar, to Caesar; and the things of the God, to the God.

26. And not they were able to take hold of him of a word in presence of the people; and wondering at the answer of him, they were silent.

27. Approaching and some of the Sadducees, those denying a resurrection not to be, asked him,

28. saying: O teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any one a brother should die having a wife, and this childless should die, that should take the brother of him the wife, and should raise up seed to the brother of himself.

29. Seven now brothers were; and the first having taken a wife, died childless.

30. And took the second the wife, and this died childless.

31. And the third took her; in like manner and also the seven; not they left children, and died.

32. Last and of all died also the woman.

33. In the therefore resurrection, of which of them will be a wife? the for seven had her a wife.

34. And answering he said to them the Jesus: The sons of the age this marry and are given marriage;

35. those but having been accounted worthy of the age that to obtain, and of the resurrection that out of dead ones, neither marry, nor are given in marriage;

36. nor for to die more are able; like angels for they are, and sons they are of the God, of the resurrection sons being.

37. That but rise the dead ones, even Moses declared at the bush, when he calls a Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. A God now not he is of dead ones, but of living ones; all for to him live.

39. Answering and some of the scribes said: O teacher, well thou hast spoken.

40. No longer and they presumed to ask him nothing.

41. He said and to them: How say they the Anointed a son of David to be?

42. And yet himself David says in a book of psalms: Said the Lord to the lord of me:

43. Sit thou at right hand of me till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool of the feet of thee.

44. David therefore a lord him calls, and how a son of him is he?

45. Hearing and all of the people, he said to the disciples of himself:

46. Beware of the scribes, those wishing to walk in robes, and loving salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places in the feasts;

47. they devour the houses of the widows, and for a show long they pray; the so will receive greater judgment.

## Luke 21

1. Looking and he saw those casting the gifts of them into the treasury rich ones.

2. He saw and also a certain widow poor casting there two lepta;

3. and he said: Truly I say to you, that the widow that poor this more of all has cast.

4. All for they out of the abundance of them cast into the gifts of the God; she but out of the want of herself all the living, which she had, she cast.

5. And some speaking about the temple that with stones beautiful and offerings it was adorned, he said:

6. These which you behold, will come days in which not will be left a stone upon a stone, which not will be thrown down.

7. They asked and him, saying: O teacher, when then these will be? and what the sign, when may be about these to be done?

8. He but said: Look you, not you may be deceived. Many for will come in the name of me, saying: That I am, and the season has approached. Not therefore go you after them.

9. When and you may hear of wars and commotions, not you may be terrified, must for these come to pass first; but not immediately the end.

10. Then he said to them: Will rise a nation on a nation, and a kingdom on a kingdom;

11. earthquakes and great in many places, and famines, and pestilences will be; fearful sights also and signs from heaven great will be.

12. Before but this all they will lay on you the hands of them, and they will persecute, delivering up to synagogues and prisons, dragging to kings and governors, on account of the name of me.

13. It will turn out and to you for a testimony.

14. Settle therefore in the hearts of you, not to premeditate to make a defence.

15. I for will give to you a mouth and wisdom, which not will be able to gainsay or resist all the opponents to you.

16. You will be delivered up and also by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and they will put to death of you.

17. And you will be being hated by all through the name of me.

18. And a hair from the head of you not not will perish.

19. In the patient endurance of you preserve you the lives of you.

20. When and you may see surrounded by encampments the Jerusalem, then you may know, that has come near the desolation of her.

21. Then those in the Judea, let them flee to the mountains; and those in midst of her, let them go out; and those in the country places, not let them enter into her.

22. For days of vengeance these are, of the to be fulfilled all the things having been written.

23. Woe but to the in womb holding and to the giving suck in those the days; will be for distress great upon the land, and wrath to the people this;

24. and they will fall by edge of a sword, and they will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by Gentiles, till may be fulfilled seasons of Gentiles.

25. And will be signs in sun and moon and stars; and on the earth anguish of nations in perplexity of a roar of sea and of tossing;

26. fainting men from fear and expectation of the things coming on the habitable; the for powers of the heavens will be shaken.

27. And then they will see the son of the man coming in a cloud, with power and glory great.

28. Beginning and of these to occur, raise yourselves and lift up the heads of you; because draws near the deliverance of you.

29. And he spoke a parable to them: See you the figtree and all the trees;

30. when they shoot forth now, beholding, from of yourselves you know, that now near the summer is.

31. So also you, when you may see these occurring, know you, that near is the kingdom of the God.

32. Indeed I say to you, that not not may pass away the generation this, till all may be done.

33. The heaven and the earth shall pass away; the but words of me not not may pass away.

34. Take heed but to yourselves, lest should be burdened of you the hearts with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and anxieties of life; and suddenly on you may come the day that.

35. As a snare for it will come on all those dwelling on face of all of the earth.

36. Watch you then in every season, praying, that you may be accounted worthy to escape these all the things being about to occur, and to stand in presence of the son of the man.

37. He was and the days in the temple teaching; the and nights going out he lodged in the mountain that being called of olive trees.

38. And all the people came early to him in the temple to hear him.

## Luke 22

1. Drew near now the feast of the unleavened cakes, that being called passover;

2. and sought the highpriests and the scribes, the how they might kill him; they feared for the people.

3. Entered and adversary into Judas that being surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

4. And going he talked with the highpriests and the officers, the how him he might deliver up to them.

5. And they were glad; and agreed to him silver to give.

6. And he consented; and he sought opportunity of the to deliver up him to them without of a crowd.

7. Came and the day of the unleavened cakes, in which it is necessary to sacrifice the paschal lamb;

8. and he sent Peter and John, saying: Going prepare you for us the passover, that we may eat.

9. They and said to him: Where wilt thou we make ready?

10. He and said to them: Lo, having entered of you into the city, will meet you a man a pitcher of water carrying; follow you him into the house, where he enters; and say you to the householder of the house:

11. Says to thee the teacher: Where is the greatchamber, where the passover with the disciples of me I may eat?

12. And he to you will show an upper room large having been furnished; there prepare you.

13. Having gone and they found even as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover.

14. And when came the hour, he reclined, and the twelve apostles with him.

15. And he said to them: With desire I have desired this the passover to eat with you, before the me to suffer.

16. I say for to you, that no more not not I may eat it, till it may be fulfilled in the kingdom of the God.

17. And having taken a cup, having given thanks he said: Take you this, and divide you among yourselves.

18. I say for to you, that not not I may drink of the product of the vine, till the kingdom of the God may come.

19. And having taken a loaf, having given thanks he broke, and gave to them, saying: This is the body of me, that in behalf of you being given; this do you in the my remembrance.

20. In like manner also the cup, after the supper, saying: This the cup, the new covenant in the blood of me, that in behalf of you being poured out.

21. But lo, the hand of the delivering up me with mine on the table.

22. And the indeed son of the man goes away according to that having been appointed; but woe to the man that, through whom he is delivered up.

23. And they began to inquire among themselves, the, which then it could be of them the this being about to do.

24. There had been and also a strife among them, the, which of them thinks to be greater.

25. He but said to them: The kings of the nations exercise lordship over them; and those having authority of them; benefactors are called.

26. You but not so; but the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and the governor, as he serving.

27. Which for greater? he reclining, or he serving? not he reclining? I but am in the midst of you as he serving.

28. You but are those having continued with me in the trials of me.

29. And I covenant for you, even as has covenanted for me the Father of me a kingdom,

30. that you may eat and you may drink at the table of me in the kingdom of me; and you may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of the Israel.

31. Said and the Lord: Simon, Simon, lo, the adversary has asked for you, the to sift as the wheat.

32. I but prayed for thee, that not may fail the faith of thee. And thou when having been turned, strengthen the brethren of thee.

33. He and said to him: O lord, with thee ready I am both to prison and to death to go.

34. He but said: I say to thee, O Peter, not not will crow today a cock, before thrice thou wilt deny not to have known me.

35. And he said to them: When I sent you without a purse, and a bag, and sandals, not anything wanted you? They and said; Nothing.

36. He said then to them: But now, he having a purse, let him take, in like manner and a bag; and he not having, let him sell the mantle of himself, and let him buy a sword.

37. I say for to you, that yet this the having been written must to be finished in me, that: And with lawbreakers he was counted. Also for the things about me an end has.

38. They but said: O lord, lo, swords here two. He and said to them: Enough it is.

39. And going out he went according to the custom to the mountain of the olivetrees; followed and him also the disciples of him.

40. Having come and to the place, he said to them: Pray you not to enter into temptation.

41. And he was withdrawn from them about of a stone throw, and having placed the knees he prayed, saying:

42. O Father if thou art willing to take away the cup this from me; but not the will of me, but the thine be done.

43. Appeared and to him a messenger from heaven, strengthening him.

44. And being in agony, very earnestly he prayed. Was and the sweat of him like clots of blood falling down to the ground.

45. And having stood up from the prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from the grief; and he said to them:

46. Why sleep you? having stood up pray you, that not you may enter into temptation.

47. While and of him speaking, lo, a crowd, and he being called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to the Jesus to kiss him.

48. The but Jesus said to him: Judas, with a kiss the son of the man betrayest thou?

49. Seeing and those about him the was going to be, said to him: O lord, if shall we strike with a sword?

50. And struck one a certain of them the slave of the highpriest, and cut off of him the ear the right.

51. Answering and the Jesus said: Let you be till this. And touching the ear of him, he healed him.

52. Said and the Jesus to those having come on him highpriests, and offices of the temple, and elders: As on a robber you have come out with swords and clubs;

53. every day being of me with you in the temple, not you did stretch out the hands on me; but this of you it is the hour, and the authority of the darkness.

54. Having seized and him they led, and brought him into the house of the highpriest. The but Peter followed at a distance.

55. Having kindled and a fire in midst of the court, and having sat down of them, sat the Peter in midst of them.

56. Seeing and him a maidservant certain sitting by the light, and looking steadily to him, she said: Also this with him was.

57. He but denied him, saying: O woman, not I know him.

58. And after a little another seeing him, said: Also thou of them art. The but Peter said: O man, not I am.

59. And having intervened about hour one, another person confidently affirmed, saying: In truth also this with him was also for a Galilean he is.

60. Said but the Peter: O man, not I know what thou sayest. And immediately, while speaking of him, crew a cock.

61. And having turned the Lord looked to the Peter; and was reminded the Peter of the word of the Lord, as he said to him: That before a cock to crow, thou mayest deny me thrice.

62. And going out, he wept bitterly.

63. And the men those having in custody the Jesus, mocked him, scourging;

64. and having blindfolded him, they struck of him the face, and they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is he striking thee?

65. And other many blaspheming they spoke against him.

66. And as it became day, were assembled the eldership of the people, highpriests and and scribes, and brought him into the sanhedrim of themselves,

67. saying: If thou art the Anointed, tell us. He said and to them: If to you I tell, not not you will believe;

68. if but also I ask, not not you would answer me, or would loose.

69. From of the now shall be the son of the man sitting at right hand of the power of the God.

70. Said and all: Thou then art the son of the God? He and to them said: You say; that I am.

71. They and said: What further need have we of testimony? Ourselves for we have heard from the mouth of him.

## Luke 23

1. And having stood up whole the multitude of them, they led him to the Pilate.

2. They began and to accuse him, saying: This we found misleading the nation, and forbidding to Caesar tax to give, saying himself an Anointed king to be.

3. The and Pilate asked him, saying: Thou art the king of the Jews? He and answering to him said: Thou sayest.

4. The and Pilate said to the highpriests and the crowds: Nothing I find criminal in the man this.

5. They but were urgent, saying: That he stirs up the people, teaching in whole of the Judea, having begin from the Galilee to here.

6. Pilate and having heard of Galilee, he asked: If the man a Galilean is.

7. And having learned, that of the authority of Herod he is, he sent him to Herod, being also him in Jerusalem in those the days.

8. The and Herod seeing the Jesus, rejoiced greatly; he was for wishing of a long time to see him, because the to hear many things about him; and hoped some sign to see by him being done.

9. He asked and him in words many; he and nothing answered him.

10. Stood up and the highpriests and the scribes, vehemently accusing him.

11. Having despised and him the Herod with the soldiers of himself, and having mocked, casting around him a robe splendid, sent again him to the Pilate.

12. Became and friends the, both Pilate and the Herod in this the day with each other; formerly for in hatred being with themselves.

13. Pilate and having summoned the highpriests and the chiefs and the people,

14. said to them: You have brought to me the man this, as misleading the people; and lo, I in presence of you having examined, nothing I found in the man this a fault, of which you accuse against him.

15. But not even Herod; I sent for you to him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done to him.

16. Having scourged therefore him I will release.

17. Necessary now it was to release to them at a feast one.

18. Cried out and all together, saying: Take away this, release and to us the Barabbas.

19. Who was through a sedition certain having occurred in the city, and a murder, having been cast into prison.

20. Again therefore the Pilate spoke to, wishing to release the Jesus.

21. They but cried, saying: Crucify, crucify, him.

22. He and third said to them: What for evil has done this? nothing a cause of death I found in him; having scourged therefore him I will release.

23. They but pressed with voices loud, demanding him to be crucified; and prevailed the voices of them and of the highpriests.

24. The and Pilate decided to satisfy the request of them.

25. He released and the through sedition and murder having been cast into the prison, whom they asked; the but Jesus he delivered to the will of them

26. And as they led him, having laid hold of Simon a certain Cyrenian coming from country, they placed to him the cross, to carry after the Jesus.

27. Followed and him a great multitude of the people, and of women; who also lamented and bewailed him.

28. Turning but to them the Jesus said: Daughters of Jerusalem, not weep you for me, but for yourselves weep you, and for the children of you.

29. For lo, come days, in which they will say: Blessed the barren ones, and wombs which not bore, and breasts which not suckled.

30. Then they will begin to say to the mountain: Fall you on us; and to the hills: Cover you us.

31. For if in the green tree these they do, in the dry what will be done?

32. Were led and also others two malefactors with him to be put to death.

33. And when they came to the place, that being called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors; one indeed at right, one at left.

34. The and Jesus said: O Father, forgive them; not for they know what they do. Having divided and the garments of him, they cast a lot.

35. And stood the people gazing; scoffed at and also the rulers with them, saying: Others he saved, let him save himself, if this is the Anointed, the of the God chosen.

36. Mocked and him also the soldiers, coming near and vinegar offering to him,

37. and saying: If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.

38. Was and also an inscription having been written over him letters in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: This is the king of the Jews.

39. One and of those having been hanged malefactors spoke against him, saying: If thou art the Anointed, save thyself and us.

40. Answering but the other rebuked him saying: Not even fearest thou the God, since in the same condemnation thou art?

41. And we indeed justly; due for which has been done we receive; this but nothing amiss has done.

42. And he said to the Jesus: Do thou remember me, O lord, when thou mayest come in the kingdom of thee.

43. And said to him the Jesus: Indeed I say to thee today, with me thou shalt be in the Paradise.

44. It was and about hour sixth, and darkness came over whole the land, till hour ninth.

45. And was darkened the sun; and was rent the veil of the temple midst.

46. And crying with a voice loud the Jesus, said: O Father, into hands of thee I commit the breath of me. And these having said, he breathed out.

47. Seeing and the centurion that having occurred, glorified the God, saying: Truly the man this just was.

48. And all the having come together crowds to the sight this, beholding the things having occurred, striking of themselves the breasts returned.

49. Stood but all the acquaintance of him at a distance, and women those having followed him from the Galilee, beholding these things.

50. And lo, a man with a name Joseph, a counsellor being, a man good and just,

51. (this not was having assented to the will and the act of the,) from Arimathea a city of the Jews, who and was looking for also himself the kingdom of the God;

52. this having gone to the Pilate, asked the body of the Jesus.

53. And having taken down it, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it, in a tomb hewn in a rock, where not was ever yet no one being laid.

54. And day was preparation, and sabbath approached.

55. Having followed after and also women, who were having been with him out of the Galilee, beheld the tomb, and now they laid the body of him.

56. Having returned and they prepared aromatics and ointments; and the indeed sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

## Luke 24

1. In the and first of the weeks, of morning very early, came to the tomb, bringing what they prepared aromatics; and some with them.

2. They found and the stone having been rolled from the tomb.

3. And having entered not they found the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it happened in the to be perplexed them about this, and lo, men two stood by them in clothing shining.

5. Afraid and having become of them, and bowing the face to the earth, they said to them: Why seek you the living among the deadones?

6. Not he is here, but has been raised. Remember you how he spoke to you, while being in the Galilee,

7. saying: That it behooves the son of the man to be delivered into hands of men of sinners, and to be crucified, and the third day to stand up.

8. And they remembered the words of him;

9. and having returned from the tomb, they related these all to the eleven and to all the others.

10. Were and the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the others with them, who spoke to the apostles these.

11. And appeared in presence of them as an idle tale the words of them, and they believed not them.

12. The and Peter arising ran to the tomb, and having stooped down he sees the linen bands lying alone; and he departed by himself, wondering that having occurred.

13. And lo, two of them were going in this the day into a village being distant furlongs sixty from Jerusalem, to which a name Emmaus.

14. And they were talking to each other about all of the having happened of these.

15. And it occurred in the to talk them and to reason, even he the Jesus having come near went with them.

16. The but eyes of them were held, the not to know him.

17. He said and to them: What the words these, which you throw to one another walking, and are sad?

18. Answering and the one, to whom a name Cleopas, said to him: Thou alone sojournest Jerusalem, and not thou knowest the things having been done in her in the days these?

19. And he said to them: What things? They and said to him: The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man a prophet, powerful in work and word in presence of the God and all the people.

20. How and delivered up him the highpriests and the chiefs of us to a sentence of death, and crucified him.

21. We but hoped, that he it is the being about to redeem the Israel; but besides all these third this day goes away today, from of which these occurred;

22. but also women some of us astonished us, having been early at the tomb;

23. and not having found the body of him, came, saying also a vision of messengers to have seen, who say him to be alive.

24. And went some of those with us to the tomb, and found thus even as also the women said; him but not they saw.

25. And he said to them: O thoughtless and slow with the heart of the to believe in all, which spoke the prophets.

26. Not these it was binding to have suffered the Anointed, and to enter into the glory of himself?

27. And beginning from Moses and from all of the prophets, he explained to them in all the writings the things about himself.

28. And they drew near to the village, where they were going; and he seemed intending further to go.

29. But they pressed him, saying: Abide with us, for towards evening it is, and has declined the day. And he went in the to abide with them.

30. And it happened in the to recline him with them, having taken the loaf, be blessed, and having broken he gave to them.

31. Of them and were opened the eyes, and they knew him; and he disappeared from them.

32. And they said to each other: Not the heart of us burning was, in us, as he was talking to us in the way, and as he was opening to us the writings?

33. And rising up in this the hour, they returned to Jerusalem; and found having been assembled the eleven and those with them,

34. saying: That has been raised the Lord indeed, and has appeared to Simon.

35. And they related the things in the way, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the loaf.

36. These and of them speaking, he stood in midst of them, and says to them: Peace to you.

37. Being terrified but and affrighted having become they thought a spirit to see.

38. And he said to them: Why having been agitated are you? and why reasonings rise in the hearts of you?

39. See you the hands of me and the feet of me, that he I am; handle you me and see you; for a spirit flesh and bones not has, as me you perceive having.

40. And this saying, he showed to them the hands and the feet.

41. While and not believing of them from the joy, and were wondering, he said to them: Have you anything eatable here?

42. They and gave to him of a fish broiled a piece, and from a honey comb.

43. And having taken, in presence of them he eat.

44. He said and to them: These the words, which I spoke to you, while being with you, that must to be fulfilled all the things having been written in the law of Moses, and prophets, and psalms concerning me.

45. Then he opened of them the mind, of the to understand the writings;

46. and he said to them: That thus it is written, and thus it behooved to have suffered the Anointed, and to stand up out of dead ones in the third day,

47. and to be proclaimed in the name of him reformation and forgiveness of sins to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

48. You and are witnesses of these.

49. And lo, I send forth the promise of the Father of me on you; you but remain you in the city, till you may be clothed power from on high.

50. He led and them out even to Bethany; and having lifted up the hands of himself, be blessed them.

51. And it happened in the to bless him them, he stood apart from them, and was carried up into the heaven.

52. And they having prostrated to him, returned to Jerusalem with joy great;

53. and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing the God.
