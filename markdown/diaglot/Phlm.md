## Philemon 1

1. Paul, a prisoner of Anointed Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon the beloved one and fellowworker of us,

2. and to Apphia the beloved one, and Archippus the fellowsoldier of us, and to the in house of thee congregation;

3. favor to you and peace from God a Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed.

4. I give thanks to the God of me always, a remembrance of the making in the prayers of me,

5. hearing of thee the love and the faith, which thou hast to the Lord Jesus and for all the holy ones;

6. that he fellowship of the faith of thee active may become by a knowledge of every good of the in us, in regard to Anointed Jesus.

7. Joy for we have much and consolation in the love of thee, because the bowels of the holy ones has been refreshed through thee, O brother.

8. Therefore much in Anointed boldness having to enjoin thee the becoming thing, Philemon

9. through the love rather I beseech; such a one being, as Paul an old man, now but also a prisoner of Jesus Anointed:

10. I beseech thee concerning of the of me child, whom I begot in the bonds of me, Onesimus,

11. that formerly to thee unprofitable, now but to thee and to me profitable, whom I sent back;

12. thou but him, that is the my bowels, do thou receive.

13. When I was wishing for myself to retain, so that on behalf of thee to me he might serve in the bonds of the glad tidings;

14. without but of the thy consent nothing I wished to do, so that not as according to constraint the good of thee might be, but according to willingness.

15. Perhaps for on account of this he was separated for an hour, so that an age him thou mightest receive;

16. no longer as a slave, but above a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, by how much but more to thee, both in flesh and in Lord.

17. If then me thou holdest a partner, receive thou him as me.

18. If but any thing he wronged thee, or owes, this to me put thou on account.

19. I Paul wrote with the my hand; I will pay off; so that not I may say to thee, that even thyself to me thou owest.

20. Yes, O brother, I of thee should be profited in Lord; refresh thou of me the bowels in Anointed.

21. Having confidence in the obedience of thee I wrote to thee, knowing, that even beyond what I may say thou wilt do.

22. At the same time but also prepare thou for me a lodging; I hope for, that through the prayers of you I shall be imparted to you.

23. Salutes thee Epaphras, the fellowcaptive of me in Anointed Jesus, Philemon

24. Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, the fellowworkers of me. Philemon

25. The favor of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with the spirit of you
