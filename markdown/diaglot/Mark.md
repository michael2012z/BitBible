# Mark

## Mark 1

1. A beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Anointed, a son of the God.

2. As it is written in Esaias the prophet: Lo, I send the messenger of me before face of thee, who will prepare the way of thee.

3. A voice crying out in the desert; Make you ready the way of a lord, straight make you the beaten ways of him.

4. Was John dipping in the desert, and publishing a dipping of reformation into forgiveness of sins.

5. And went out to him all the Judea country, and the Jerusalem all; and were dipped in the Jordan river by him, confessing the sins of them.

6. Was now John having been clothed hairs of a camel, and a belt made of skin around the loins of him, and eating locusts and honey wild.

7. And he cried out saying: Comes the mightier of me after me, of whom not I am worthy bowed down to loose the string of the sandals of him.

8. I indeed dipped you in water; he but will dip you in spirit holy.

9. And it came to pass in those the days, came Jesus from Nazareth of the Galilee, and was dipped by John into the Jordan.

10. And immediately ascending from the water, he saw rending the heavens, and the spirit, as a dove, descending upon him.

11. And a voice came out of the heavens: Thou art the son of me the beloved in whom I delight.

12. And immediately the spirit him casts into the desert.

13. And he was in the desert days forty, being tempted by the adversary, and was with the wild beasts; and the messengers ministered to him.

14. After now the to be delivered up the John, came the Jesus into the Galilee, preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of the God,

15. and saying: That has been fulfilled the season, and has come nigh the majesty of the God; reform you, and believe you in the good message.

16. Walking and by the sea of the Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of him, casting a fishing net in the sea; they were for fishers.

17. And said to them the Jesus: Come after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.

18. And immediately leaving the nets of them, they followed him.

19. And going thence a little, he saw James the of the Zebedee, and John the brother of him, and themselves in the ship were mending the nets;

20. and immediately he called them. And leaving the father of them Zebedee in the ship with the hirelings, they went after him.

21. And they went into Capernaum; and immediately to the sabbath going into the synagogue, he taught.

22. And they were amazed at the teaching of him; he was for teaching them as authority having, and not as the scribes.

23. And was in the synagogue of them a man in spirit unclean, and he cried out,

24. saying: Let alone, what to us and to thee, Jesus O Nazarene, comet thou to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy of the God.

25. And rebuked him the Jesus, saying: Be silent, and come out of him.

26. And convulsing him the spirit the unclean, and crying a voice great, came out of him.

27. And they were astonished all, so as to reason among themselves, saying: What is this? what the teaching the new this? that with authority even to the spirits to the unclean he enjoins and they harken to him.

28. Went out and the report of him forthwith into whole the country of the Galilee.

29. And instantly, out of the synagogue being come, he went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

30. The and motherinlaw of Simon was laid down having a fever; and immediately they spoke to him about her.

31. And coming he raised her, having laid hold of the hand of her; and left her the fever immediately; and ministered to them.

32. Evening and being come, when set the sun, they brought to him all those sickness having, and those being demonized;

33. and the city whole having been assembled was at the door.

34. And he healed many sick having various diseases; and demons many cast out, and not allowed to speak the demons, because they knew him.

35. And early, night much, having arisen he went out, and depart into a desert place, and there prayed.

36. And eagerly followed him the Simon and those with him.

37. And having found him, they say to him: That all seek thee.

38. And he says to them: We must go into the neighboring towns, that also there I may preach; for this because I have come out.

39. And he was proclaiming in the synagogues of the, in whole the Galilee, and the demons casting out.

40. And comes to a leper, beseeching him and kneeling him, and saying to him: That if thou wilt, thou art able me to cleanse.

41. The and Jesus being moved with pity, stretching out the hand, touched of him, and says to him; I will, be thou cleansed.

42. And having said of him, immediately departed from him the leprosy, and he was cleansed.

43. And having strictly charged him, immediately he sent forth him,

44. and says to him: See, to no one anything thou tell; but go, thyself show to the priest, and offer for the purification of thee what enjoined Moses, for a witness to them.

45. He but going out began to publish many (things) and spread abroad the word, so as no longer him to be able publicly into a city to enter; but without in desert place he was, and they went to him from all parts.

## Mark 2

1. And again he went into Capernaum after days; and it was reported, that into a house he is.

2. And immediately were gathered together many, so as no longer to contain not even the places near the door; and he spake to them the word.

3. And they come to him a paralytic bringing, being carried by four.

4. And not being able to come nigh to him through the crowd, they uncovered the roof, where he was; and having dug through they let down the bed upon which the paralytic was laid.

5. Seeing and the Jesus the faith of them, says to the paralytic: Son, are forgiven of thee the sins.

6. Were but some of the scribes there sitting and reasoning in the hearts of them:

7. Why this thus speaks blasphemy? Who is able to forgive sins, if not one the God?

8. And immediately knowing the Jesus to the spirit of himself, that thus they reasoned among themselves, said to them: Why these (things) reason you in the hearts of you?

9. Which is easier? to say to the paralytic: Are forgiven of thee the sins? or to say: Arise, take up of thee the bed, and walk?

10. That but you may know, that authority has the son of the man on the earth to forgive sins; (he says to the paralytic:)

11. To thee I say: Arise, take up the bed of thee, and go into the house of thee.

12. And he was raised immediately, and taking up the bed, went out in presence of all; so as to astonish all, and to glorify the God, saying: That never thus we saw.

13. And he went out again by the sea; and all the crowds came to him, and he taught them.

14. And passing on he saw Levi the of the Alpheus, sitting at the custom house, and says to him: Follow me. And arising up he followed him.

15. And it happened in the to recline at table him in the house of him, and many publicans and sinners reclined with the Jesus and the disciples of him; they were for many, and they followed him.

16. And the scribes and the Pharisees seeing him eating with the publicans and sinners, said to the disciples of him: Why that with of the publicans and sinners he eats and drinks?

17. And hearing the Jesus says to them: No need have those being well of a physician, but those sick being. Not I came to call just (ones) but sinners.

18. And were the disciples of John and the Pharisees fasting; and they come, and they say to him: Why the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast; those but to thee disciples not fast?

19. And said to them the Jesus: Not are able the sons of the bridechamber, in which the bridegroom with them is, to fast? so long a time with themselves they have the bridegroom, not are able to fast.

20. Will come but days, when may be taken away from them the bridegroom, and then they will fast in that the day.

21. No one a patch of cloth unfulled sews on to a mantle old; if but not, takes away the patch of itself the new of the old, and worse a rent becomes.

22. And no one puts wine new into bottles old; if but not, bursts the wine the new the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are lost; but wine new into bottles new must be put.

23. And it came to pass to go him in the sabbath through the cornfields, and began the disciples of him a way to make plucking the ears of corn.

24. And the Pharisees said to him: See, why do they in the sabbath, what not is lawful?

25. And he said to them: Never have you known, what did David, when need he had, and was hungry, he and those with him?

26. How he went into the house of the God, to Abiathar of the highpriest, and the loaves of the presence did eat, which not is lawful to eat if not the priests, and he gave also to those with him being?

27. And he said to them: The sabbath because of the man was made, not the man because of the sabbath.

28. So that a lord is the son of the man even of the sabbath.

## Mark 3

1. And he entered again into the synagogue; and was there man having been withered having the hand,

2. and they closely watched him, if to the sabbath he will heal him, that they might accuse him.

3. And he says to the man to that having been withered having the hand: Arise in the midst.

4. And he says to them: Is it lawful to the sabbath to do good or to do evil? a life to save, or to destroy? They but were silent.

5. And looking round them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of the hearts of them, he says to the man: Stretch out the hand of thee. And he stretched it out; and was restored the hand of him.

6. And coming out the Pharisees, immediately with the Herodians a council held against him, how him they might destroy.

7. And the Jesus with the disciples of him withdrew to the sea; and a great multitude from the Galilee followed him; and from the Judea, and from Jerusalem,

8. and from the Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and those about Tyre and Sidon, a multitude great, having heard what things he did, came to him.

9. And he spake to the disciples of him, that a small vessel should attend him, because of the crowd, that not they might throng him.

10. Many for he cured, so as to rush to him, that him they might touch, as many as had scourges.

11. And the spirits the unclean, when him gazing on, fell before him, and cried, saying: That thou art the son of the God.

12. And many times he charged them, that not known him they should make.

13. And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom would he; and they came to him.

14. And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them to preach,

15. and to have authority to cure the diseases, and to cast out the demons.

16. And he put on to the Simon a name Peter;

17. and James that of the Zebedee, and John the brother of the James; and he put on them names Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder;

18. and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James that of the Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and the Simon the Canaanite,

19. and Judas Iscariot, who even delivered up him.

20. And they come into a house. And came together again a crowd, so as not to be able them not even bread to eat.

21. And having heard those with him, went out to restrain him; they said for: That he is out of place.

22. And the scribes, those from Jerusalem having come down, said: That Beelzebul he has; also; That by the chief of the demons he casts out the demons.

23. And having called them, in parables he said to them: How is able an adversary and adversary to cast out?

24. And if a kingdom against herself should be divided, not able to stand the kingdom that;

25. and if a house against herself should be divided, not able to stand the house that;

26. and if the adversary has risen up against himself and has been divided, not able to stand, but an end he has.

27. No one is able the household goods of the strong man, entering into the house of him, to plunder, if not first the strong man he should bind; and then the house of him he will plunder.

28. Indeed I say to you, that all will be forgiven to the sons of the men the sins, and the evil speakings, whatever they may revile;

29. who but ever may speak evil to the spirit the holy, not has forgiveness to the age, but liable is of agelasting judgment.

30. Because they said: A spirit unclean he has.

31. Comes then the mother of him and the brothers of him; and without standing they sent to him, calling him.

32. And sat a crowd about him; said and to him: Lo, the mother of thee and the brothers of thee without are seeking thee.

33. And he answered to them, saying: Who is the mother of me, or the brothers of me?

34. And looking about round those about him sitting, he says: Lo the mother of me, and the brothers of me.

35. Who for ever may do the will of the God, this a brother of me, and a sister of me and a mother is.

## Mark 4

1. And again he began to teach by the sea; and was assembled to him a crowd great, so as him entering into the ship, to sit in the sea; and all the crowd by the sea on the land was.

2. And he taught them in parables many, and said to them in the teaching of him:

3. Hear you: Lo, went out the sower of the (seed) to sow.

4. And it happened in the sowing, this indeed fell on the path; and came the birds, and ate it.

5. Another and fell on the rocky ground, where not it had earth much; and immediately it sprung up, through the not to have a depth of earth.

6. Sun and having arisen, it was scorched, and through the not to have a root, was dried up.

7. And another fell into thorns; and sprung up the thorns, and chocked it, and fruit not it gave.

8. And another fell into the ground the good; and it bore fruit springing up and increasing; and bore one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.

9. And he said: He having ear to hear, let him hear.

10. When and he was alone, asked him those about him, with the twelve, the parables.

11. And he said to them: To you it is given to know the secret of the kingdom of the God; to them but to those without in parables the all (things) are done;

12. that seeing they may see, and not they may see; and hearing they may hear, and not they may hear; lest they should turn, and should be forgiven to them the sins.

13. And he says to them: Nat know you the parable this? and how all the parables will you know?

14. He sowing, the word sows.

15. These and are they by the path, where is sown the word, and when they may hear, immediately comes the adversary, and takes the word that having been sown in the hearts of them.

16. And these are like those on the rocky ground being sown, who, when they may hear the word, immediately with joy they receive it;

17. and not they have a root in themselves, but for a reason they are; then occurring trial or persecution through the word, immediately they are offended.

18. And others are those into the thorns, being sown; these are those the word hearing,

19. and the cares of the age, and the delusion of the wealth, and the about the other (things) strong desires entering in choke the word; and unfruitful it becomes.

20. And these are those upon the ground the good being sown, who hear the word, and accept; and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.

21. And he said to them: Neither the lamp comes, that under the measure it may be placed, or under the couch? not that on the lampstand it may be placed?

22. Not for is any thing hidden, which if not it may be disclosed; nor was stored away, but that into light it may come.

23. If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.

24. And he said to them: Consider you, what you hear. In what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.

25. Who for ever may have, it shall be given to him; and who not has, even what he has will be taken from him.

26. And he said: Thus is the kingdom of the God, as if a man should cast the seed on the earth,

27. and should sleep and wake night and day, and the seed should germinate and grow up, as not knows he.

28. Of its own accord for the earth bears fruit, first, a plant, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.

29. When but may be ripe the fruit, immediately he sends the sickle, for is ready the harvest.

30. And he said: To what may be compare the kingdom of the God? or by what parable may we compare her?

31. As a grain of mustard, which, when it may be sown on the earth, less of all of the seeds it is of those on the earth;

32. and when it may be shown, it springs up and becomes of all herbs greater, and produces branches great, so as to be under the shadow of it the birds of the heaven to build nests.

33. And such like parables many he spoke to them the word, even they were able to hear.

34. Without but a parable not he spoke to them; privately but to the disciples of himself he explained all.

35. And he says to them in that the day, evening being come: We may pass over to the other side.

36. And having left the crowd they took him, as he was in the ship; also other and ships was with him.

37. And arose a squall of wind great; the and waves dashed into the ship, so as it was now to fill.

38. And was he in the stern, on the pillow sleeping; and they awoke him, and they said to him: O teacher, not it concerns thee, that we perish?

39. And having arisen he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Be silent, be still. And ceased the wind, and was a calm great.

40. And he said to them: Why timid are you so? how not you have faith?

41. And they feared a fear great, and said to one another: Who then this is, for even the wind and the sea hearken to him.

## Mark 5

1. And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.

2. And having come to him out of the ship, immediately met him out of the tombs a man in spirit unclean,

3. who the dwelling had in the tomb; and not even with chains no one was able him to bind,

4. for the him many times with fetters and chains to have been bound, and to have been hurt by him the chains, and the fetters to have been broken; and no one him was able to tame;

5. and always, night and day, in the tombs and in mountains he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.

6. Seeing and the Jesus from a distance, he ran, and prostrated to him;

7. and crying out with voice great, said: what to me and to thee, Jesus, O son of the God of the highest? I will adjure thee the God, not me thou mayest torment.

8. (He had said for to him: Come out the spirit the unclean out of the man.)

9. And he asked him: What thy name? and he says to him: Legion name to me; for many we are.

10. And he besought him many times, that not them he would send out of the country.

11. Was and there near to the mountain a herd of swine great feeding.

12. And besought him the demons, saying: Dismiss us into the swine, that into them we may go.

13. And gave leave to them immediately the Jesus. And having come out the spirits the unclean entered into the swine; and rushed the herd down the precipice into the sea; they were and about two thousand; and were choked in the sea.

14. Those and feeding them fled, and reported to the city, and to the villages. And they came out to see, what is that having been done.

15. And they come to the Jesus, and they behold the being demonized sitting and having been clothed, and being of sane mind, and having been possessed by the legion; and they were afraid.

16. And related to them those having seen, how it happened to the one being demonized, and about the swine.

17. And they began to entreat him to depart from the coasts of them.

18. And entering of him into the ship, besought him he having been demonized, that he might be with him.

19. And not he suffered him, but he says to him: Go into the house of thee to the friends, and relate to them, how much to thee the Lord has done, and has pitied thee.

20. And he went, and began to publish in the Decapolis, how much had done to him the Jesus; and all were astonished.

21. And having passed over the Jesus in the ship again to the other side, were gathered a crowd great to him; and he was by the sea.

22. And lo, comes one of the synagoguerulers, by name Jairus; and seeing him, he fell to the feet of him,

23. and besought him much, saying: That the littledaughter of me last end is; that coming thou mayest put to her the hands, so that she may be saved; and she shall live.

24. And he went with him; and followed him a crowd great, and pressed on him.

25. And a woman certain being in a flow of blood years twelve,

26. and many things having suffered under many physicians, and having spent the things of her all, and nothing having seen benefited, but rather into the worse state having come,

27. having heard about Jesus, having come in the crowd behind, touched the mantle of him.

28. (She said for: That even if the cloths of him I may touch, I shall be saved.)

29. And immediately was dried up the source of the blood of her; and knew to the body, that was saved from the scourge.

30. And immediately the Jesus knowing in himself the out of himself power having gone out, having turned round in the crowd, said: Who of me touched the clothes?

31. And said to him the disciples of him: Thou seest the crowd pressing on thee; and sayest thou: Who me touched?

32. And he was looking round to see the (woman) this having done.

33. The but woman, fearing and trembling, having known what was done on her, came and fell down to him, and told to him all the truth.

34. He but said to her: Daughter, the faith of thee has saved thee; go in peace, and be thou well from the scourge of thee.

35. While of him speaking, they came from the synagoguerulers, saying: That the daughter of thee is dead; why yet troubled thou the teacher?

36. The but Jesus immediately, having heard the word being spoken, says to the synagogueruler: Not fear, only believe thou.

37. And not he suffered no one him to follow, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.

38. And he comes into the house of the synagogueruler, and he sees a tumult, and weeping and wailing much.

39. And having entered he says to them: Why are you troubled and do you weep? the child not is dead, but sleeps.

40. And they derided him. He but, having sent out all he takes the father of the child, and the mother and those with him, and goes in, where was the child.

41. And having grasped the hand of the child, he says to her: Talitha, cumi; which is being translated: The girl, to thee I say, arise.

42. And immediately arose the girl, and walked about; she was for years twelve. And they were astonished with an astonishment great.

43. And he charged them much, that no one might know this; and spake to have given to her to eat.

## Mark 6

1. And he went out thence, and came into the country of himself; and follow him the disciples of him.

2. And being come sabbath, be began in the synagogue to teach. And many hearing were astonished, saying: Whence to this these things? and what the wisdom that being given to him? and miracles so great through the hands of him are done.

3. Not this is the carpenter, the son of Mary, brother and of James, and Joses, Juda, and Simon? and not are the sisters of him here with us? And they were stumbled in him.

4. Said but to them the Jesus: That not is a prophet without honor, except in the country of himself, and among the relatives, and in the house of himself.

5. And not was able there no one miracle to do, except a few sick having put on the hands, were cured.

6. And he wondered because of the unbelief of them. And he went out round the villages round about, teaching.

7. And he calls the twelve, and he began them to send two two; and he gave to them authority of the spirits of the unclean,

8. and he charged them, that nothing they should take for a way, except a staff only; no bag, no bread, not into the belt copper money;

9. but having been shod sandals; and not you may put on two coats.

10. And he said to them: Whence if you may enter into a house, there remain till you may go away from thence.

11. And whoever not may receive you, nor hear you, going away from thence, shake out the dust that under the feet of you, for a witness to them.

12. And having gone out they published, that they should reform;

13. and demons many they cast out, and anointed with oil many sick ones, and they were cured.

14. And heard the king Herod, (wellknown for was the name of him,) and wellknown for was the name of him,) and he said: That John he dipping out of dead has been raised, and through the work the mighty powers in him.

15. Others said: That Elias he is. Others and said: That a prophet he is, like one of the prophets.

16. Having heard for the Herod, said: That whom I beheaded John, he is raised from dead.

17. Himself for the Herod, sending seized the John, and bound him in prison, through Herodias, the wife of Philip of the brother of himself, for her he had married.

18. Said for the John to the Herod: That not it is lawful to thee to have the wife of the brother of thee.

19. The and Herodias had a grudge against him and wished him to destroy; and not was able.

20. The for Herod feared the John, knowing him a man just and holy; and protected him; and hearing him, many things he did, and gladly him he heard.

21. And having come a day convenient, when Herod to the birthday of himself a feast he made to the nobles of himself, and to the commanders, and to the chiefs of the Galilee;

22. and having entered of the daughter of her of the Herodias, and dancing, and having pleased the Herod and those reclining at table, said the king to the little girl: Ask me, whatever thou wilt, and I will give to thee.

23. And he swore to her: That whatever me thou mayst ask, I will give to thee, till half of the kingdom of me.

24. The and going out, said to the mother of herself: What shall I ask? She and said: The head of John the dipper.

25. And coming in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying: I will that to me thou wouldst give instantly on a plate the head of John the dipper.

26. And very sorry having become the king, because of the oaths and those reclining at table not he would her reject.

27. And immediately sending the king a guardsman, he ordered to be brought the head of him. He and going forth cut off the head of him in the prison;

28. and brought the head of him on a plate, and gave her to the little girl; and the little girl gave her to the mother of herself.

29. And having heard the disciples of him, came, and took the dead body of him, and placed it in a tomb.

30. And were assembled the apostles to the Jesus, and reported to him all, and what they did, and what they taught.

31. And he said to them: Come you yourselves privately into a desert place, and rest you a little. Were for those coming and those going many; and not even to eat they had leisure.

32. And they went into a desert place to the ship privately.

33. And they saw them going away; and knew many; and on foot from all of the cities they ran together there.

34. And coming out he saw great a crowd, and was moved with pity towards them, for they were as sheep, not having a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.

35. And already time much having gone, coming to him the disciples of him, they say: That a desert is the place, and already time much;

36. dismiss them, that going into the surrounding country and villages, they may buy themselves loaves; any for they might eat not they have.

37. He but answering said to them: Give to them you to eat. And they say to him: Going may we buy denarii two hundred loaves, and give to them to eat?

38. He but says to them: How many loaves have you? go you and see you. And having ascertained, they say: Five and two fishes.

39. And he ordered them to make recline all, company company, on the green grass.

40. And they reclined squares squares, by a hundred, and by fifty.

41. And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to the heaven, he gave praise, and broke the loaves, and gave to the disciples of him, that they might set before them; and the two fishes he divided to all.

42. And they ate all, and were filled.

43. And they took up of fragments twelve baskets full, and of the fishes.

44. And were those having eaten the loaves, five thousand men.

45. And immediately he urged the disciples of himself to step into the ship, and to go before to the other side to Bethsaida, while he should dismiss the crowd.

46. And having sent away them, he went into the mountain to pray.

47. And evening having come, was the ship in middle of the sea; and he alone upon the land.

48. And he saw them tormented in the rowing; was for the wind opposite to them. And about fourth watch of the night comes towards them, walking on the sea; and wished to pass them.

49. They but, seeing him walking on the sea, they thought a phantom to be, and they cried out.

50. All for him saw, and were terrified. And immediately he spoke with them, and says to them: Take courage; I am, not be afraid.

51. And he went up to them into the boat; and ceased the wind. And greatly out of measure in themselves they were amazed and wondered.

52. Not for they understood about the loaves; was for the heart of them having been stupified.

53. And having passed over they came to the land Gennesaret; and drew to the shore.

54. And coming out of them out of the ship, immediately knowing him,

55. running about whole the adjacent country that, they began on the couches those sickness having to carry out, where they heard, that there he is.

56. And wherever he entered into towns, or cities, or villages, in the markets they placed those being sick, and they besought him, that if even the tuft of the mantle of him they might touch; and whoever touched him, were saved.

## Mark 7

1. And were gathered to him the Pharisees, and some of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem;

2. and seeing some of the disciples of him with common hands, that is unwashed, eating loaves;

3. (the for Pharisees and all the Jews, if not with fist they may wash the hands, not they eat, holding the tradition of the elders;

4. and from a market, if not they might dip, not they eat; and other many things is, which they received to hold, dippings of cup, and of pots, and of copper vessels, and of couches);

5. then asked him the Pharisees and the scribes: Why the disciples of thee not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but with common hands they eat the loaf?

6. He but answering said to them: That well prophesied Esaias about you the hypocrites, as it is written: This the people with the lips me honor, the but heart of them far off is removed from me.

7. In vain but they worship me, teaching teachings, commandments of men.

8. Leaving for the commandment of the God, you hold the tradition of the men, dippings of pots and of cups; and other similar such like many things you do.

9. And he said to them: Well you set aside the commandment of the God, that the tradition of you you may keep.

10. Moses for said: Honor the father of thee and the mother of thee; and: He cursing father or mother, a death let him die.

11. You but say: If should say man to the father or the mother, Corban (which is, a gift), whatever out of me thou mightest be profited;

12. and no more you suffer him any thing to do for the father of himself, or for the mother of himself

13. making void the word of the God for the tradition of you, which you delivered; and similar such like many things you do.

14. And having called all the crowd, he said to them: Hear me all, and be instructed.

15. Nothing is outside of the man, entering into him, which is able him to make common; but the things proceeding from him, those is the things making common the man.

16. If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.

17. And when he entered into a house from the crowd, asked him the disciples of him concerning the parable.

18. And he says to them: Thus also you without understanding are? Not know you, that all that without, entering into the man, not is able him to make common?

19. that not goes of it into the heart, but into the belly; and into the privy goes out, cleansing all the foods.

20. He said and: That the out of the man, proceeding forth, that makes common the man.

21. Within for out of the heart of the men the purposes the evil proceeds; adulteries, fornications, murders,

22. thefts, covetousnesses, villianies, deceit, intemperance, eye evil, evil speaking, pride, folly;

23. all these the things evil within comes forth, and makes common the man.

24. And thence arising, he went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and entering into the house, no one he wished to know; and not he was able to be concealed.

25. Having heard for a woman about him, of whom had the little daughter of herself a spirit unclean, having come fell down to the feet of him;

26. (was now the woman a Greek, a Syrophenician to the birth;) and she besought him, that the demon he would cast out of the daughter of herself.

27. The but Jesus said to her: Let alone first to be filled the children; not for good it is, to take the bread of the children, and to cast to the dogs.

28. She but answered, and says to him: Yes, sir; even for the dogs under the table eatest from of the crumbs of the children.

29. And he said to her: Through this the word go; has come out the demon from the daughter of thee.

30. And having gone into the house of her, she found the demon having gone out, and the daughter having been laid upon the bed.

31. And again coming out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of the Galilee, through midst of the borders of Decapolis.

32. And they bring to him a deaf man a stammerer, and they entreat him that he might place to him the hand.

33. And having taken him from the crowd privately, he put the fingers of himself into the ears of him, and spitting he touched the tongue of him;

34. and looking up to the heaven, he groaned, and says to him: Ephphatha, that is, be opened.

35. And immediately were opened of him the ears; and was loosed the bond of the tongue of him, and he spoke plainly.

36. And he charged them, that no one they should tell; what but he to them charged, more abundantly they published.

37. And beyond measure they were astonished, saying: Well all (things) he has done; and the deaf ones he makes to hear, and the dumb ones to speak.

## Mark 8

1. In those the days, very great crowd being, and not having any thing they could eat, having called the disciples of himself he says to them:

2. I have pity on the crowd; because now days three, they continue with me and not they have any thing they can eat.

3. And if I dismiss them fasting into house of themselves, they will faint on the way; come for of them a great distance have come.

4. And answered to him the disciples of him: Whence these will be able any one here to satisfy of loaves in a desert place?

5. And he asked them: How many have you loaves? They and say: Seven.

6. And he gave orders to the crowd to recline upon the ground; and taking the seven loaves, giving thanks he broke, and gave to the disciples of himself, that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.

7. And they had small fishes a few; and giving praise, he said: Place before also them.

8. They ate and, and were filled; and they took up over and above of fragments, seven large baskets.

9. Were and those having eaten, about four thousand; and he dismissed them.

10. And immediately entering into the ship with the disciples of himself, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

11. And came forth the Pharisees, and began to argue with him, seeking of him a sign from the heaven, tempting him.

12. And groaning deeply to the spirit; of himself, he says: Why the generation this a sign seeks? Indeed I say to you, if shall be given to the generation this a sign.

13. And leaving them, entering again into the ship, he departed to the other side.

14. And they forgot to take loaves, and except one loaf not they had with themselves in the ship.

15. And he charged them saying: Look you, beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

16. And they reasoned with one another saying: Because loaves not we have.

17. And knowing the Jesus he says to them: Why reason you, because loaves not you have? Not yet perceive you, neither understand you? Yet having been stupified have you the heart of you?

18. Eyes having not see you? and ears having not hear you? and not remember you?

19. When the five loaves I broke to the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him: Twelve.

20. When and the seven to the four thousand, how many large baskets full of fragments took you up? They and said: Seven.

21. And he said to them: How is it not you understand?

22. And he comes to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man and beseech him, that him he would touch.

23. And having taken the hand of the blind man, he led him outside of the village; and having spit into the eyes of him, having placed the hands to him, he asked him, if any thing he sees.

24. And looking up he says: I see the men, like trees, walking.

25. Then again he placed the hands upon the eyes of him, and he made him look up and was restored, and he saw plainly every one.

26. And he sent him to house of him saying: Neither into the village mayest thou enter, nor mayest thou tell any one in the village.

27. And departed the Jesus and the disciples of him into the villages of Caesarea of the Philip. And on the way he asked the disciples of himself, saying to them: Who me they say the men to be?

28. They and answered: John the dipper; and others, Elias; others and, one of the prophets.

29. And he says to them: You but who me you say to be? Answering and the Peter says to him: Thou art the Anointed.

30. And he strictly charged them, that no one they should tell about him.

31. And he began to teach them, that must the son of the man many things to suffer, and to be rejected of the elders and of the highpriests and of the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to stand up;

32. and plainly the word he spoke. And taking aside him the Peter, he began to rebuke him.

33. He but turning round, and seeing the disciples of himself, he rebuked the Peter, saying: Go thou behind me, adversary; because not thou thinkest the things of the God, but the things of the men.

34. And having called the crowd with the disciples of himself, he said to them: Whoever wishes after me to follow, let him deny himself, and let him bear the cross of himself, and let him follow me.

35. Who for ever may wish the life of himself to save, shall loose her. Who but ever may lose the of himself life on account of me and of the glad tidings shall save her.

36. (What for will it profit a man, if he should win the world whole, and he should forfeit the life of himself?

37. or what shall give a man in exchange for the life of himself?)

38. Who for ever may be ashamed me and the my words in the generation this the adulterous and sinful, also the son of the man will be ashamed him, when he may come in the glory of the Father of himself with the messengers of the holy ones.

## Mark 9

1. And he said to them: Indeed I say to you, that are some of those here having stood, who not not shall taste of death, till they may see the royal majesty of the God having come in power.

2. And after days six takes the Jesus the Peter, and the James and John, and leads up them into a mountain high privately alone; and he was transfigured in the presence of them

3. And the garments of him became glittering, white extremely as snow, such as a fuller upon the earth not is able to make white.

4. And appeared to them Elias with Moses; and were talking with the Jesus.

5. And answering the Peter says to the Jesus: Rabbi, good it is us here to be; and we may make tents three, to thee one, and Moses one, and Elias one.

6. Not for he knew any thing he might say; there were for terrified.

7. And there came a cloud overshadowing them; and came a voice out of the cloud: This is the son of me the beloved; him hear you.

8. And suddenly looking round, no longer no one they saw, but the Jesus alone with themselves.

9. Coming down and of them from the mountain, he charged them, that to no one they should relate what they saw, except when the son of the man out of dead ones should be raised.

10. And the word they kept to themselves, arguing, what is that out of dead ones to be raised.

11. And they asked him, saying: That say the scribes, that Elias must to come first?

12. He and answering said to them: Elias indeed coming first; restores all things, and how it is written about the son of the man, that many things he should suffer, and should be despised.

13. But I say to you, that both Elias has come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, even as it is written about him.

14. And coming to the disciples, he saw a crowd great about them, and scribes disputing with them.

15. And immediately all the crowd, seeing him, were awestruck, and running to saluted him.

16. And he asked them: What dispute you wish with them?

17. And answering one out of the crowd said: O teacher, I brought the son of me to thee, having a spirit dumb.

18. And wherever him it may seize, it convulses him; and he foams, and grinds the teeth of him, and pines away. And I spoke to the disciples of thee, that it they might cast out, and not they had power.

19. He and answering to them says: O generation without faith, till when you shall I be? till when shall I bear you? Bring you him to me.

20. And they brought him to him. And seeing him, immediately the spirit convulsed him; and falling upon the ground, he rolled, foaming.

21. And he asked the father of him: How long a time is it, since this happened to him? He and said: From a child;

22. and often him both into fire has cast and into waters, that it might destroy him; but if any thing thou canst do, give aid to us, having pity on us.

23. The and Jesus said to him: That, if thou art able to believe; all things are possible to the believing.

24. And immediately crying out the father of the child, with tears he said: I believe help thou of me the unbelief.

25. Seeing and the Jesus, that runs together a crowd, he rebuked the spirit the unclean, saying to it: The spirit the dumb and deaf, I to thee command; Come out of him, and no more enter into him.

26. And crying out, and many times convulsing, it came out. And he became as dead, so that many to say, that he is dead.

27. The but Jesus taking him of the hand, raised up him; and he stood up.

28. And having come him into a house, the disciples of him asked him privately: That we not were able to cast out it?

29. And he said to them: This the kind by nothing is able to go out, if not in prayer and fasting.

30. And thence departing, he passed through the Galilee; and not was willing, that any one should know.

31. He taught for the disciples of himself, and said to them: That the son of the man is delivered up into hands of men, and they will kill him; and having been killed, the third day he will rise.

32. They but did not understand the word, and were afraid him to ask.

33. And he came to Capernaum; and in the house being, he asked them: What in the way among yourselves were you disputing?

34. but were silent; with one another for they had disputed on the way, who greater.

35. And sitting down, he called the twelve, and says to them: If any one desires first to be, he will be of all last, and of all a servant.

36. And taking a little child, he placed it in midst of them, and embracing in his arms it, he said to them:

37. Whoever one of the such little children may receive in the name of me, me receives; and whoever me may receive, not me receives, but the having sent me.

38. Answered and to him John, saying: O teacher, I saw one to the name of thee casting out demons; and we forbade him, because not he follows us.

39. He but Jesus said: Not do you forbid him. No one for is, who will do a mighty work in the name of me, and will be able readily to speak evil of me.

40. Who for not is against you, for you is.

41. Who for ever may give drink to you a cup of water, in name, because of Anointed you are, indeed I say to you, not not he may lose the reward of himself.

42. And whoever may insnare one of the little ones, of the believing into me, good it is to him rather, if hangs a stone of a mill around the neck of him, and has been cast into the sea.

43. And if may insnare thee the hand of thee, cut thou off her; good to thee it is crippled into the life to enter, than the two hands having to go into the Gehenna, into the fire the inextinguishable,

44. where the worm of them not dies, and the fire not is quenched.

45. And if the foot of thee may insnare thee, cut thou off him; good it is to thee to enter into the life lame, than the two feet having to be cast into the Gehenna, into the fire the inextinguishable,

46. where the worm of them not dies, and the fire not is quenched.

47. And if the eye of thee may insnare thee, cast thou out him; good to thee it is oneeyed to enter into the kingdom of the God, than two eyes having to be cast into the Gehenna of the fire,

48. where the worm of them not dies, and the fire not is quenched.

49. Every one for with fire shall be salted; and every sacrifice with salt shall be salted.

50. Good the salt; if but the salt without taste may become, with what it will you season? Have you in yourselves salt, and be you at peace with one another.

## Mark 10

1. And from thence arising he comes into the borders of the Judea, by the other side if the Jordan; and come together again crowds he taught them.

2. And approaching Pharisees asked him: If it is lawful for a man a wife to release? trying him.

3. He and answering said to them: What to you did enjoin Moses?

4. They and said: Moses allowed a scroll of separation to be written, and to release.

5. And answering the Jesus said to them: For the hardness of heart of you he wrote to you the commandment this.

6. From but a beginning of creation a male and a female he made them the God

7. On account of this shall leave a man the father of himself and the mother, and shall be closely united to the wife of himself.

8. And shall be the two into flesh one. So that no longer they are two, but one flesh.

9. What then the God has joined together, a man not disunites.

10. And in the house again the disciples of him concerning of the him asked him.

11. And he says to them: Whoever may release the wife of himself, and may marry another, commits adultery with her.

12. And if a woman may release the husband of herself, and may be married to another, commits adultery.

13. And they brought to him little children, that he might touch them; the but disciples rebuked those bringing.

14. Seeing but the Jesus was displeased, and said to them: Allow the little children to come to me, not hinder them; of the for such like is the kingdom of the God.

15. Indeed I say to you, whoever not may receive the kingdom of the God like a little child, not not may enter into her.

16. And embracing in his arms them, having placed the hands upon them, he blessed them.

17. And going out of him into a way, running up one, and kneeling before him, he asked him: O teacher good, what must I do, that life agelasting I may inherit?

18. The and Jesus said to him: Why me callest thou good? no one good, if not one, the God.

19. The commandments thou knowest: Not thou must commit adultery; Not thou must kill; Not thou must steal; Not thou must testify falsely; Not thou must defraud; Honor the father of thee, and the mother.

20. He but answering said to him: O teacher, these all I kept from childhood of me.

21. He but Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One to thee lacks; go, whatever thou hast sell, and give to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and hither, follow me, take up the cross.

22. He but looking sad at the word, went away sorrowing; he was for having possessions many.

23. And looking round the Jesus, says to the disciples of himself: How hardly those the riches having into the kingdom of the God shall enter.

24. They and disciples were astonished at the words of him. The but Jesus again answering says to them: Children, how difficult it is those having confidence in the riches, into the kingdom of the God to enter.

25. Easier it is a camel through the hole of the needle to pass, than a rich man into the kingdom of the God to enter.

26. They and greatly were amazed, saying among themselves: And who is able to be saved?

27. Looking on and to them the Jesus says: With men impossible but not with the God; all for possible is with the God.

28. Began the Peter to say to him: Lo, we left all, and followed thee.

29. Answering the Jesus said: Indeed I say to you, no one is, who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, on account of me and on account of the glad tidings,

30. if not he may receive a hundred fold, now in the season this, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and fields, with persecutions, and in the age to come life agelasting.

31. Many but shall be first, last; and last, first.

32. They were and in the way going up to Jerusalem; and was going before them the Jesus; and they were amazed, and following they were afraid. And taking aside again the twelve, he began to them to tell the things being about to him to happen:

33. For lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the son of the man will be delivered up to the highpriests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and they will deliver up him to the Gentiles,

34. and they will mock him, and they will scourge him, and they will spit upon him, and they will kill him; and the third day he will stand up.

35. And come to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying: O teacher, we wish, that whatever we may ask, thou mayst do for us.

36. He but said to them: What do you wish to do me for you?

37. They and said to him: Give to us, that one at right of thee, and one at left of thee we may sit in the glory of thee.

38. The and Jesus said to them: Not you know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup, which I drink, and the dipping, which I am dipped, to be dipped?

39. They and said to him: We are able. The and Jesus said to them: The indeed cup, which I drink, you will drink; and the dipping, which I am dipped, you will be dipped;

40. the but to sit at right of me and at left, not is mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared.

41. And having heard the ten, they began to be angry about James and John.

42. The but Jesus having called them, he says to them: You know, that those presuming to rule the nations, lord it over them, and the great of them exercise authority over them.

43. Not so but it shall be among you; but whoever may wish to become great among you, shall be of you a servant;

44. and whoever may wish of you to become first, shall be of all a slave.

45. And for the son of the man not came to be served, but to serve, and to give the life of himself a ransom for many.

46. And they come into Jericho; and going out of him from Jericho, and the disciples of him, and a crowd great, a son of Timeus, Bartimeus the blind, sat by the way begging.

47. And hearing, that Jesus the Nazarene it is, he began to cry out and to say: The son of David, Jesus, have pity me.

48. And rebuked him many, so that he might be silent; he but much more cried out: O son of David, have pity on me.

49. And stopping the Jesus, said him to be called; and they called the blind, saying; to him: Take courage, rise up; he calls thee.

50. He and throwing off the mantle of himself, arising came to the Jesus.

51. And answering says to him the Jesus: What dost thou wish I may do to thee? The and blind said to him: Rabboni, that i may see again.

52. The and Jesus said to him: Go; the faith of thee has saved thee. And immediately he saw again, and followed him in the way.

## Mark 11

1. And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mountain of the olive trees, he sends two of the disciples of himself, and says to them:

2. Go you into the town that opposite you; and immediately entering into her, you will find a colt having been tied, upon which no one of men has sat; having loosed him lead you.

3. And if any one to you should say: Why do you this? say you: That the master of him need has; and immediately him he will send here.

4. They went and, and found a colt having been tied near the door without in the street; and they loosen him.

5. And some of those there standing said to them: What do you loosing the colt?

6. They and said to them even as commanded the Jesus; and they suffered them.

7. And they led the colt to the Jesus, and they threw upon him the mantles of themselves; and he sat upon him.

8. Many and the mantles of themselves spread in the way; others and branches cut off from the trees, and scattered in the way.

9. And those going before and those following did cry, saying: Hosanna; worthy of blessing be coming in name of Lord;

10. worthy of blessing the coming kingdom of the father of us David; Hosanna in the highest.

11. And entered into Jerusalem the Jesus, and into the temple; and having looked round on all, evening now being the hour, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.

12. And the next day coming out of them from Bethany, he was hungry;

13. and seeing a fig tree at a distance, having leavens, he went, if perhaps he will find any thing on her; and coming to her, nothing he found except leaves; not for it was season of figs.

14. And answering he said to her: No more of thee to the age no one fruit may eat. And heard the disciples of him.

15. And they come to Jerusalem; and going into temple he began to cast out those selling and buying in the temple; and the tables the moneychangers, and the seats of those selling the doves he overturned;

16. and not suffered, that any one should carry an article through the temple.

17. And he taught, saying to them: Not is it written: That the house of me, a house of prayer shall be called for all the nations? you but have made it a den of robbers.

18. And heard the scribes and the highpriests, and they sought how him they might destroy; they feared for him, because all the crowd was amazed at the teaching of him.

19. And when evening it became, he went out of the city.

20. And in the morning passing along, they saw the figtree having been withered from roots;

21. And remembering the Peter, says to him: Rabbi, lo, the figtree, which thou didst curse, has been withered.

22. And answering the Jesus says to them: Have you faith of God.

23. Indeed for I say to you, that whoever may say to the mountain this: Be lifted up, and cast into the sea; and not should doubt in the heart of himself, but should believe that what he says comes to pass; it shall be to him whatever he may say.

24. Through this I say to you, all things whatever praying you desire, believe you that you receive, and it shall be to you.

25. And when you stand praying, forgive, if any thing you have against any one; that also the Father of you, that in the heavens, may forgive you the faults of you.

26. If but you not forgive, neither the Father of you, that in the heavens, will forgive the faults of you.

27. And they come again to Jerusalem. And in the temple walking of him, come to him the highpriests and the scribes and the elders,

28. and they say to him: By what authority these things doest thou? and who to thee the authority this gave, that these things thou mayest do?

29. The but Jesus answering said to them: I will ask you also I one word; and answer you to me, and I will tell to you, by what authority these things I do.

30. The dipping of John from heaven was or from men? answer you to me.

31. And they reasoned among themselves, saying: If we should say: From heaven, he will say: Why then not did you believe him?

32. But if we should say: From men; they feared the people; all for held the John, that really a prophet was.

33. And answering they say to the Jesus. Not we know. And the Jesus answering says to them: Neither I say to you, by what authority these things I do.

## Mark 12

1. And he began to them in parables to talk: A vineyard planted a man, and placed around a hedge, and dug a winevat, and built a tower; and let out it to husbandmen, and went abroad.

2. And he sent to the husbandmen in the season a slave, that from the husbandmen, he might receive of the fruit of the vineyard.

3. They but taking him, they flayed, and sent away empty.

4. And again he sent to them another slave; and this pelting with stones they wounded of the head, and sent away having dishonored.

5. And another he sent; and this they killed; and many others, some indeed flaying, some but killing.

6. Yet therefore one son having, beloved of himself he sent and him to them last, saying: That they will regard the son of me.

7. Those but the husbandmen said to themselves: That this is the heir; come, we may kill him, and of us shall be the inheritance.

8. And having taken him, they killed, and cast out of the vineyard.

9. What therefore will do the lord of the vineyard? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.

10. Not even the writing this have you read: A stone which rejected those building, this was made into a head of a corner;

11. by a Lord was done this, and it is wonderful in eyes of us?

12. And they sought him to seize, but they feared the crowd; they knew for, that to them the parable he spoke. And leaving him, they went away.

13. And they send to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that him they might catch in word.

14. They having come they say to him: O teacher, we know, that true thou art, and not cares thee about no one; not for thou lookest into face of men, but in truth the way of the God thou teachest; is it lawful tribute to Caesar to give, or not? should we give, or not should we give?

15. He but knowing of them the hypocrisy, said to them: Why me do you tempt? bring you to me a denarius, that I may see.

16. They and brought. And he says to them: Of whom the likeness this, and the inscription? They and said to him: Of Caesar.

17. And answering the Jesus said to them: Give you back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of the God, to the God. And they wondered at him.

18. And come Sadducees to him, who say a resurrection not to be; and they asked him, saying:

19. O teacher, Moses wrote for us, that if any brother should die, and should leave behind a wife, and children not should leave, that should take the brother of him the wife of him, and should raise up seed, to the brother of himself.

20. Seven brothers were; and the first took a wife, and dying not left seed.

21. And the second took her, and died, and neither he left seed; and the third in like manner.

22. And took her the seven, and not left seed. Last of all died also the woman.

23. In the therefore resurrection when they shall rise, of whom of them shall be a wife? the for seven had her a wife.

24. And answering the Jesus said to them: Not through this do you err, not knowing the writings, neither the power of the God?

25. When for out of dead (ones) they may rise, neither they marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as messengers in the heavens.

26. Concerning but the dead (ones), that they rise, not have you read in the book of Moses, at the bush as said to him the God, saying: I the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

27. Not is the God of dead (ones), but of living (ones). You therefore greatly err.

28. And approaching one of the scribes, having heard them disputing, knowing that well to them he answered, asked him: Which is first of all commandment?

29. The and Jesus replied to him: That first of all commandment; Hear you Israel, a Lord, the God of us, Lord one is;

30. and thou shalt love a Lord the God of thee out of whole of the heart of thee, and out of whole of the soul of thee, and out of whole of the mind of thee, and out of whole of the strength of thee. This first commandment.

31. And second like, this: Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee as thyself. Greater of these another commandment not is.

32. And said to him the scribe: Well, O teacher, in truth thou speakest, that one he is and not is another besides him;

33. and the to love him out of whole of the heart, and out of whole of the understanding, and out of whole the soul, and out of whole of the strength, and the to love the neighbor as himself, more is of all of the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

34. And the Jesus, seeing him, that discreetly he answered, said to him: Not far thou art from the kingdom of the God. And no one no longer presumed him to ask.

35. And answering the Jesus said, teaching in the temple: How say the scribes, that the Anointed a son is a David?

36. Himself for the David said by spirit holy: Says the Lord to the lord of me: Sit thou at right of me, till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool of the feet of thee.

37. himself therefore David calls him lord; and whence a son is he? And the great crowd heard him gladly.

38. And he said to them in the teaching of himself: Beware you of the scribes, those desiring in long robes to walk about, and salutations in the markets,

39. and first seats in the synagogues, and upper couches at the feasts;

40. those devouring the houses of the widows, and for a show long are praying; these will receive heavier judgment.

41. And sitting the Jesus over against the treasury, he beheld how the crowd casts copper into the treasury. And many rich cast much.

42. And coming one widow poor, cast mites two, which is a farthing.

43. And having called the disciples of himself, he said to them: Indeed I say to you, that the widow this the poor more of all has cast of those casting into the treasury.

44. All for out of the abounding fulness to them have cast; this but out of the poverty of herself all as much as she had cast, whole the living of herself.

## Mark 13

1. And departing of him out of the temple, says to him one of the disciples of him: O teacher, see, what stones and what buildings.

2. And the Jesus answering said to him: Seest thou these the great buildings? not not may be left a stone upon stone, which not not may be thrown down.

3. And sitting of him on the mountain of the olive trees, over against the temple, asked him privately Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew;

4. Say to us, when these things shall be, and what the sign, when are about all these things to be ended?

5. The and Jesus answering them began to say: Take heed not any one you may deceive.

6. Many for shall come in the name of me, saying: That I am; and many they will deceive.

7. When and ye all hear wars and reports of wars, not be disturbed; it behooves for to take place; but not yet the end.

8. Shall be raised up for nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and shall be earthquakes in places, and shall be famines and commotions. Beginnings of sorrow these.

9. Take heed but you yourselves; they will deliver up for you to sanhedrims, and to synagogues you will be beaten, and before governors and kings you will stand, on account of me, for a testimony to them.

10. And among all the nations it behooves, first, to be published the glad tidings.

11. When but they may lead you deliver up, not be anxious beforehand what you should speak, nor be concerned; but whatever may be given to you in that the hour, this speak you; not for are you the speaking, but the spirit the holy.

12. Will deliver up and a brother a brother to death and father a child; and they shall rise up children against parents, and deliver to death them.

13. And you will be being hated by all through the name of me. He but persevering to end, this will be saved.

14. When but you may see the abomination of the desolation having stood where not it ought; (he reading let him think); then those in the Judea, let them flee to the mountains;

15. he and on the roof, not let him go down into the house, nor enter, to take any thing out of the house of himself;

16. and he in the field being, not let him turn into the back, to take the mantle of him.

17. Woe but to the in womb having and to the giving suck in those the days.

18. Pray you but, that not may be the flight of you of winter.

19. Shall be for the days those affliction, such as not has been go great from a beginning of creation, which created the God, till the now, and not not may be.

20. And if not a Lord shortened the days, not should be saved all flesh; but on account of the chosen (ones), whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.

21. And then if any one to you should say: Lo, here the Anointed; or, Lo, there; not believe you.

22. Shall be raised for false anointed ones and false prophets, and shall give signs and wonders, to the to deceive, if possible, even the chosen.

23. You but take heed; lo, I have foretold to you all.

24. But in those the days, after the affliction that, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon not shall give the light of herself;

25. and the stars of the heaven shall be falling, and the powers, those in the heavens, shall be shaken.

26. And then they shall see the son of the man coming on clouds, with power much and glory.

27. And then he will send the messengers of himself, and he will gather the chosen (ones) of himself from the four winds, from an extremity of earth to an extremity of heaven.

28. From but the figtree learn you the parable; when of her now the branch tender may become, and may put forth the leaves, you know, that near the summer is.

29. So also you, when these things you may see coming to pass, know you, that near he is at doors.

30. Indeed I say to you, that not not may pass away the generation this, till of whom all these may be done.

31. The heaven and the earth shall pass away; the nut words of me not not may pass away.

32. Concerning but the day that or the hour no one knows, nor the messengers, those in heaven, nor the son, if not the Father.

33. Take heed, watch you and pray you; not you know for when the season is.

34. As a man going abroad leaving the house of himself, and having given to the slaves of himself the authority, and to each one the work of himself and to the porter he commanded that he should watch.

35. Watch you therefore; not you know for, when the lord of the house comes, evening, or midnight, or cockcrowing, or morning;

36. lest coming suddenly, he may find you sleeping.

37. What and to you I say, to all I say: Watch you.

## Mark 14

1. Was now the passover and the unleavened cakes after two days; and sought the highpriests and the scribes, how him by deceit seizing they might kill.

2. They said but: Not in the feast, lest a tumult shall be of the people.

3. And being of him in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, reclining of him, came a woman having an alabaster box of balsam, of spikenard genuine very costly; and breaking the alabaster box, she poured of it down on the head.

4. Were and some being angry to themselves, and saying: For what the loss this of the balsam has been made?

5. Could for this of the balsam to be sold more three hundred denarii, and to be given to the poor. And they censured her.

6. The but Jesus said: Let alone her; why to her troubles present you? good a work she has wrought in me.

7. Always for the poor you have with yourselves, and, when you will, you can them good to do; me but not always you have.

8. The having this, she has done; beforehand to anoint of me the body for the burial.

9. Indeed I say to you, wherever may be published the glad tidings this in whole the world, also what she did this shall be spoken, for a memorial of her.

10. And the Judas the Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the highpriests, that he might deliver up him to them.

11. They and hearing were glad; and promised him silver to give. And he sought, how conveniently him he might deliver up.

12. And the first day of the unleavened cakes, when the paschal lamb was sacrificed, they say to him the disciples of him: Where wilt thou having gone we make ready, that thou mayest eat the passover?

13. And he sends two of the disciples of himself, and he says to them: Go you into the city; and will meet you a man a pitcher of water carrying; follow him;

14. and wherever he may enter, say to the householder: That the teacher says: Where is the guestchamber, where the passover with the disciples of me I may eat?

15. And he to you will show an upper room large having been furnished ready; there prepare you for for us.

16. And went forth the disciples of him, and came into the city, and found even as he said to them; and they prepared the passover.

17. And evening being come, he comes with the twelve.

18. And reclining of them and eating, said the Jesus: Indeed I say to you, that one of you will deliver up me, who is eating with me.

19. They and began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Not I? and another: Not I?

20. He but answering said to them: One of the twelve, that dipping in with me into the bowl.

21. The indeed son of the man goes away, even as it has been written concerning him; woe but to the man that, through whom the son of the man is delivered up; good it was to him, if not was born the man that.

22. And eating of them, taking the Jesus a loaf, having blessed he broke and gave to them, and said: Take; this is the body of me.

23. And taking the cup, having given thanks he gave to them; and they drank out of it all.

24. And he said to them: This is the blood of me, that of the new covenant, that concerning many being shed.

25. Indeed I say to you, that no more not not I will drink of the product the vine till the day that, when it I drink new in the kingdom of the God.

26. And having sung a hymn, they departed to the mountain of the olive trees.

27. And says to them the Jesus: That all will be stumbled at me in the night this; for it written: I will smite the shepherd, and will be scattered the sheep.

28. But after the to be raised me, I will go before you into the Galilee.

29. The but Peter said to him: Even if all shall be stumbled, yet not I.

30. And says to him the Jesus: Indeed I say to thee, that thou thisday in the night this, before twice a cock to have crowed, thrice thou wilt deny me.

31. He but with vehemence spoke more: If me must to die with thee, not not thee I will deny. In like manner and also all they said.

32. And they came to a place, of which the name Gethsemane; and he says to the disciples of himself: Sit you here, till I shall pray.

33. And he takes the Peter and James and John with himself; and began to be greatly amazed and to be in anguish.

34. And he says to them: Extremely sorrowful is the soul of me even to death; remain you here, and watch.

35. And going forward a little, he fell on the ground; and prayed, that, if possible it is, might pass from him the hour.

36. And he said: Abba the Father, all (things) possible to thee; take the cup from me this. But not, what I will, but what thou.

37. And he comes, and finds them sleeping; and he says to the Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? not couldst thou one hour to watch?

38. Watch you and pray you, that not you enter into temptation; the indeed spirit ready, the but flesh weak.

39. And again going away he prayed, the same word saying.

40. And having returned, he found them again sleeping; were for the eyes of them weighed down and not they knew, what to him they might answer.

41. And he comes the third, and he says to them: Do you sleep the now and rest you? it is enough, is come the hour; lo, is delivered up the son of the man into the hands of the sinners.

42. Arise, let us go, lo, he delivering up me has come near.

43. And immediately, while of him speaking, comes Judas, one being of the twelve, and with him crowd great with swords and clubs, from the highpriests and the scribes and the elders.

44. Had given and he delivering up him a signal to them, saying: Whoever I may kiss, he it is; seize him and lead away safely.

45. And coming, immediately approaching to him, he says: Rabbi, rabbi; and kissed him.

46. They then laid on him the hands of them, and seized him.

47. One and a certain of those standing, drawing the sword, struck the slave of the highpriest, and cut off of him the ear.

48. And answering the Jesus said to them: As upon a robber came you out with swords and clubs, to take me.

49. Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and not you seized me; but that must be fulfilled the writings.

50. And leaving him all they fled.

51. And one a certain young man followed him, wrapped about a linen cloth on naked; and they seized him the young men.

52. He but leaving the linen cloth, naked he fled from them.

53. And they led the Jesus to the highpriest; and came together to him all the highpriests, and the elders, and the scribes.

54. And the Peter at a distance followed him even to into the place of the highpriest; and was sitting in company with the attendants, and warming himself to the light.

55. The and highpriests and whole the high council sought against the Jesus testimony for the to put to death him; and not they found.

56. Many for testified falsely against him, but consistent the testimonies not were.

57. And some having stood up, testified falsely against him, saying:

58. That we heard him saying: That I will destroy the temple this the made with hands, and in three days another made without hands I will build.

59. And not even thus consistent was the testimony of them.

60. And arising the highpriest in midst, he asked the Jesus, saying: Not answerest thou nothing? what these of thee testify against?

61. He but was silent and nothing he answered. Again the highpriest asked him and says to him: Thou art the Anointed, the son of the Blessed?

62. The and Jesus said: I am; and you shall see the son of the man at right sitting of the power, and coming with the clouds of the heaven.

63. The and highpriest, having rent the clothes of himself, says: What further need we have of witnesses?

64. You have heard the blasphemy; what to you appears? They but all condemned him to be deserving of death.

65. And began some to spit upon him, and to cover the face of him, and to beat with the fist him, and to say to him: Prophesy. And the attendants with open hands him beat.

66. And being the Peter in the courtyard below, comes one of the maidservants of the highpriest;

67. and seeing the Peter warming himself, she looking to him says: And thou with the Nazarene Jesus wast.

68. He but denied, saying: Not know, nor comprehend what thou sayest. And he went out into the outer court; and a cock crew.

69. And the maidservant seeing him again began to say to the having stood by: That this of them is.

70. He and again denied. And after a little again those having stood by said to the Peter: Truly of them thou art; also for a Galilean thou art, and the speech of thee is like.

71. He then began to curse and swear: That not I know the man this, of whom you say.

72. And of second cock crew. And remembered the Peter the word, of which said to him the Jesus: That before a cock to have crowed twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And reflecting he wept.

## Mark 15

1. And immediately on the morning a council having been held the highpriests with the elders and scribes, even whole the sanhedrim, binding the Jesus, carried and delivered up to the Pilate.

2. And asked him the Pilate: Thou art the king of the Jews? He and answering said to him: Thou sayest.

3. And accused him the highpriests many things.

4. The and Pilate again asked him, saying: Not answerest thou nothing? see, how many things of thee they testify against.

5. The but Jesus no longer nothing answered; so as to surprise the Pilate.

6. At now feast he used to release to them one prisoner whomever they asked.

7. Was and he being named Barabbas with the insurgents having been bound, who in the sedition murder had committed.

8. And crying out the crowd began to demand, as always he did to them.

9. The but Pilate answered them saying: Do you wish I shall release to you the King of the Jews?

10. He knew for, that through envy had delivered up him the highpriests.

11. The and highpriests stirred up the crowd, that rather the Barabbas he should release to them.

12. The but Pilate answering again said to them: What then you wish I shall do whom you call a king of the Jews?

13. They but again cried out: Crucify him.

14. The and Pilate said to them: What for evil has he done? They but vehemently cried out: Crucify him.

15. The then Pilate, being willing to the crowd the satisfaction to make, released to them the Barabbas, and delivered up the Jesus, having scourged, that he might be crucified.

16. The and soldiers led away him within the court, which is a judgment hall; and they call together whole the company.

17. And they clothed him purple, and placed it around him braiding an acanthine wreath.

18. And theybegan to salute him: Hail the king of the Jews.

19. And they struck of him the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and placing the knees did homage to him.

20. And when they mocked him, they took off him the purple, and put on him the clothes the own; and they led out him, that they might crucify him.

21. And they compel passing by one Simon a Cyrenian, coming from country, (the father of Alexander and Rufus), that he might bear the cross of him.

22. And they bring him to Golgotha place; which is being translated, of a skull a place.

23. And they gave him to drink having been mixed with myrrh wine; he but not received.

24. And crucifying him, they divide the clothes of him, casting lots on them, who what should take.

25. It was and hour third, and they crucified him.

26. And was the inscription of the accusation of him was written over: The king of the Jews.

27. And with him they crucify two robbers; one at right, and one at left of him.

28. And was fulfilled the writing that saying: And with lawlessness he was numbered.

29. And those passing along reviled him, shaking the heads of them, and saying: Ah, he destroying the temple, and in three days building;

30. save thyself, and come down from the cross.

31. In like manner also the highpriests, mocking to one another with the scribes, said: Others he saved, himself not is able to save?

32. The Anointed the king of the Israel, let him descend now from the cross, that we may see and may believe. And those having been crucified with him reproached him.

33. Being come and hour sixth, darkness was on whole the land, till hour ninth.

34. And the hour the ninth cried the Jesus with a voice loud, saying: Eloi, Eloi; lamma sabachthani? which is being translated: The God of me, the God of me; to what me hast thou left?

35. And some of those standing by hearing, said: Lo, Elias he calls.

36. Running and one, and filling a sponge of vinegar, attaching and to a reed, gave to drink him saying: Let alone; we may see, if comes Elias to take down him.

37. The then Jesus uttering a voice loud, breathed out.

38. And the curtain of the temple was rent into two, from above to below.

39. Seeing but the centurion, that having stood by over against him, that thus having cried he breathed out, said: Truly the man this a son was of a god.

40. Were and also women from a distance beholding; among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the of the James the little and Joses mother, and Salome;

41. who also when he was in the Galilee, followed him, and served him; and others many, those having come up with him to Jerusalem.

42. And now evening being come (since it was preparation, that is before sabbath),

43. came Joseph that from Arimathea, of rank a senator, who also himself was expecting the kingdom of the God, assuming courage went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of the Jesus.

44. The and Pilate wondered, if already he was dead; and having called the centurion he asked him, if already he had died.

45. And knowing from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

46. And having bought lien, and having taken down him, he wrapped the lien; and laid him in a tomb, which was having been hewn out of a rock; and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.

47. The but Mary the Magdalene and Mary of Joses beheld, where he was laid.

## Mark 16

1. And being past the sabbath, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary that of the James, and Salome bought aromatics, that coming they might anoint him.

2. And very early of the first of week they came to the tomb, having risen the sun.

3. And they said to themselves: Who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?

4. And looking up they saw, that had been rolled away the stone; it was for great very.

5. And having entered into the tomb, they saw a youth sitting on the right, having been clothed a robe white; and they were awestruck.

6. He but says to them: Not be you amazed; Jesus you seek the Nazarene, the having been crucified; he has been raised, not he is here; see the place, where they laid him.

7. But go, say to the disciples of him, and to the Peter, that he goes before you into the Galilee; there him you will see, as he said to you.

8. And having gone out, they fled from the tomb; had seized and them trembling and astonishment, and to no one nothing they said; they were afraid for.

9. Having risen and early first of week he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, from whom he had cast seven demons.

10. She going brought back word to those with him having been, mourning and weeping.

11. And those having heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.

12. After but these things to two of them walking he appeared in another aspect, going into country.

13. And those having gone brought back word to the rest; neither to them did they give credit.

14. Afterwards, reclining with them to the eleven he appeared; and reproached the unbelief of them and hardness of heart, because of those having seen him having been raised not they gave credit.

15. And said to them: Having gone into the world all, publish the glad tidings to all the creation.

16. He having believed and having been dipped, shall be saved; he but not having believed, shall be condemned.

17. Signs and to those having believed these shall attend: In the name of me demons they shall cast out; with tongues they shall speak new;

18. serpents they shall take up; and if deadly thing they may drink, not not them it may hurt; upon sick ones hands they shall place, and well they will be.

19. The indeed then Lord, after the to have spoken to them, he was taken up into the heaven, and sat at right of the God;

20. those and having gone forth published everywhere, the Lord working with and the word ratifying through the accompanying signs.
