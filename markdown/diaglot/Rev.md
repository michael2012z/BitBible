# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. A revelation of Jesus Anointed, which gave to him the God, to point out to the bondservants of himself the things it behooves to have done with speed, and he signified having sent by means of the messenger of himself to the bondservant of himself to John;

2. who testified the word of the God, and the testimony of Jesus Anointed, what things he saw.

3. Blessed the one reading, and those hearing the words of the prophecy, and keeping strictly the things in it having been written; the for season near.

4. John to the seven congregations to those in the Asia; favor to you and peace from the one existing and the one who was and the one coming; and from the seven spirits, which is in presence of the throne of him;

5. and from Jesus Anointed, the witness the faithful, the firstborn of the deadones, and the prince of the kings of the earth; to the one loving us and having washed us from the sins of us in the blood of himself,

6. and made us a kingdom, priests to the God and Father of himself, to him the glory and the strength for the ages of the ages; so be it.

7. Lo, he comes with the clouds, and shall see him every eye, and those who him pierced; and shall mourn over him all the tribes of the earth; yes, so be it.

8. I am the Alpha and the Omega, says Lord the God, the one existing and the one who was and the one coming, the almighty.

9. I John, the brother of you, and copartner in the affliction and kingdom and patience of Jesus Anointed, was in the island that being call Patmos, on account of the word of the God, and on account of the testimony of Jesus Anointed.

10. I was in spirit in the Lords day; and I heard behind of me a voice loud as of a trumpet,

11. saying: What thou seest do thou write for a scroll, and send to the seven congregations, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned I saw seven lampstands golden,

13. and in midst of the seven lampstands like to a son of man, having on a garment reaching to the foot, and having been girded about at the breasts a girdle golden;

14. the but head of him and the hairs, white as wool white, as snow; and the eyes of him as a flame of fire;

15. and the feet of him like to fine white brass, as in a furnace having been set on fire; and the voice of him as a vice of waters many;

16. and having in the right of himself hand stars seven; and out of the mouth of him a broad sword twomouthed sharp proceeding; and the appearance of him, as the sun shines in the power of himself.

17. And when I saw him I fell at the feet of him, as dead; and he placed the right of himself on me, saying: Not do thou fear; I am the first and the last,

18. and the living one; even I was dead, and lo living I am for the ages of the ages; and I have the keys of the death and of the unseen.

19. Write thou therefore the things thou sawest, even the things are, and the things about to occur after these;

20. the secret of the seven stars which thou sawest on the right of me, and the seven lampstands the golden. The seven stars, messengers of the seven congregations are; and the lampstands the seven, seven congregations are.

## Revelation 2

1. By the messenger of the in Ephesus congregation do thou write: These things says the one holding the seven stars in the right of himself, the one walking in midst of the seven lampstands the golden.

2. I know the works of thee, and the toil of thee, and the patient endurance of thee, and that not thou art able to bear with bad ones; and thou hast tried those declaring themselves apostles to be, and not they are; and thou hast found them liars;

3. and patient endurance thou hast, and thou hast suffered on account of the name of me, and not thou hast wearied.

4. But I have against thee, because the love of thee the first thou hast relaxed.

5. Do thou remember therefore whence thou hast fallen, and change thy mind, and the first works do thou; if but not, I am coming to thee speedily, and I will remove the lampstand of thee out of the place of itself, if not thou dost change thy mind.

6. But that thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations. To the one overcoming I will give to him to eat from the wood of life, which is in the paradise of the God of me.

8. And by the messenger of the in Smyrna congregation do thou write: These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived;

9. I know of thee the works, and the affliction, and the poverty, (but rich thou art,) and the blasphemy from those declaring Jews to be themselves, and not are, but an assembly of the adversary.

10. Not fear thou the things thou art about to suffer; lo, is about to cast the accuser from of you into prison, so that you may be tried; and you shall have affliction days ten. Be thou faithful till death, and I will give to thee the crown of the life.

11. The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations. The one overcoming not not he may be hurt by the death the second.

12. And by the messenger of the in Pergamos congregation do thou write: These things says the one having the broad sword that twomouthed the sharp.

13. I know the works of thee, and where thou dwellest, where the throne of the adversary; and thou holdest fast the name of me, and not thou didst deny the faith of me, even in those days in which Antipas the witness of me the faithful, who was killed among you, where the adversary dwells.

14. But I have against thee a few things, because thou hast there some holding the teaching of Balaam, who instructed the Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to fornicate.

15. So hast also thou some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.

16. Change thy mind therefore; if but not, I am coming to thee quickly, and I will war with them by the broadsword of the mouth of me.

17. The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations. To the one coming I will give to him of the manna of that having been hidden, and I will give to him a pebble white, and on the pebble a name new having been written, which no one knows if not the one receiving.

18. And by the messenger of the in Thyatira congregation write: These things says the son of the God, the one having the eyes of himself as a flame of fire, and the feet of him like to fine white brass.

19. I know of thee the works, and the love, and the faith, and the service, and the patient endurance of thee, and the works of thee the last more of the first.

20. But I have against thee, because thou lettest alone the wife of thee Jezebel, the one calling herself a prophetess, and she teaches and seduces the my bondservants, to fornicate and to eat idol sacrifices.

21. And I gave to her time so that she might reform, and not she wills to reform from the fornication of herself;

22. lo, I cast her into a bed, and those committing adultery with her into affliction great, if not they should reform from the works of her,

23. and the children of her I will kill with death; and I shall know all the congregations, that I am the one searching reins and hearts; and I will give to you to each one according to the works of you.

24. To you but I say, to the remaining ones to those in Thyatira, as many as not hold the teaching this, who not knew the depths of the adversary (as they say). Not I will lay on you other burden;

25. but what you have, hold fast till of which I may have come.

26. And the one overcoming, and the one keeping till an end the works of me, I will give to him authority over the nations;

27. and he shall rule them with a rod made of iron, as the vessels those earthen ones it is breaking together, as also I received from of the Father of me;

28. and I will give to him thew star the morning.

29. The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations.

## Revelation 3

1. And by the messenger of the in Sardis congregation write: These things says the one having the seven spirits of the God, and the seven stars. I know of thee the works, that a name thou hast that thou livest, and dead thou art.

2. Become thou vigilant, and strengthen the things remaining which were about to die; not for I have found of thee the works having been complete in presence of the God of me.

3. Remember thou therefore how thou hast received and thou didst hear, and observe, and reform. If therefore not thou shouldst have watched, I may have come on thee as a thief, and not not thou mayest have known what hour I may have come on thee.

4. But thou hast a few names in Sardis, which not soiled the garments of themselves; and they shall walk with me in white (robes), because worthy they are.

5. The one overcoming, this shall invest himself with garments white; and not not I will blot out the name of him out of the scroll of the life, and I will confess the name of him in presence of the Father of me, and in presence of the messengers of him.

6. The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregation.

7. And by the messenger of the in Philadelphia congregation write: These things says the holy one, the true one, the one having the key of the David; the one opening, and no one shuts; and shuts, and no one opens.

8. I know of thee the works; lo, I have placed before thee a door having been opened, which no one is able to shut her; because a little thou hast power, and thou hast kept of me the word, and not thou didst deny the name of me.

9. Lo, I give out of the assembly of the adversary those saying themselves Jews, to be, and not they are, but speak falsely; lo, I will make them, so that they may have come and may have prostrated before the feet of thee, and they may have known, that I loved thee;

10. because thou hast kept the word of the patience of me, also I thee will keep from the hour of the trial of that being about to come on the habitable whole, to try those dwelling on the earth.

11. I come speedily; hold thou fast what thou hast, so that no one may have taken the crown of thee.

12. The one overcoming, I will make him a pillar in the temple of the God of me, and outside not not he may have gone out any more; and I will write on him the name of the God of me, and the name of the city of the God of me, of the new Jerusalem, that coming down out of the heaven from the God of me, and the name of me the new.

13. The one having an hear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations.

14. And by the messenger of the in Laodicea congregation write: These things says the Amen, the witness the faithful and true, the beginning of the creation of the God.

15. I know of thee the works, that neither cold thou art, nor hot; I wish cold thou wert, or hot.

16. Thus, because lukewarm thou art, and neither hot nor cold, I am about thee to vomit out of the mouth of me. Because thou sayest;

17. that rich I am, and have been enriched, and not any need I have, and not thou knowest, that thou art the wretched one and the pitiable one, and poor and blind and naked;

18. I counsel thee to have bought from of me gold having been burnt by fire, so that thou mayest have been rich; and garments white, so that thou mightest have been clothed, and not might have appeared the shame of the nakedness of thee; and eyesalve, to have rubbed in the eyes of thee, so that thou mayest see.

19. I as many as if I may love, I prove and admonish; be thou zealous therefore and reform.

20. Lo, I have stood at the door, and knock; if any one may have heard the voice of me, and may have opened the door, I will go in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.

21. The one overcoming, I will give to him to have sat with me in the throne of me, as also I overcame, and am sat down with the Father of me in the throne of him.

22. The one having an hear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations.

## Revelation 4

1. After these things I saw, and lo, a door having been opened in the heaven, and the voice the first which I heard as of a trumpet talking with me, saying: Come thou up here, and I will show to thee the things it behooves to have done after these things.

2. And immediately I was in spirit; and lo, a throne was placed in the heaven, and on the throne one sitting;

3. and the one sitting like in appearance to a stone a jasper and a sardius; and a rainbow around about the throne like in appearance to an emerald.

4. And round about the throne thrones twentyfour; and on the thrones twentyfour elders sitting, having been clothed, with garments white, and on the heads of them crowns golden.

5. And from the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire burning in presence of the throne, which are the seven spirits of the God;

6. and in presence of the throne as a sea made of glass, like crystal; and in midst of the throne and in a circle of the throne four living ones being full of eyes before and behind.

7. And the living one the first like to a lion, and the second living one like to a young bullock, and the third living one had the face of a man, and the fourth living one like to an eagle flying.

8. And the four living ones, one by one of them had apiece wings six, round about and within they are full of eyes; and rest not they have of day and of night, saying: Holy holy, holy Lord the God the almighty, the one who was and the one existing and the one coming.

9. And when shall give the living ones glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne, to the one living for the ages of the ages,

10. shall fall down the twentyfour elders in presence of the one sitting on the throne, and they shall do homage to the one living for the ages of the ages, and they shall cast the crowns of themselves in presence of the throne saying;

11. worthy thou art, O Lord, to receive the glory and the honor and the power; because thou didst create the all things, and on account of the will of thee they were, and were created.

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw on the right of the one sitting on the throne a scroll having been written within and at the back, having been sealed up with seals seven.

2. And I saw a messenger strong, publishing with a voice great: Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loose the seals of it?

3. And no one was able in the heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, to open the scroll, nor to see it.

4. And I was weeping much, because no one worthy was found to open the scroll, nor to see it.

5. And one of the elders says to me: Not do thou weep; lo, prevailed the lion that of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, to open the scroll and the seven seals of it.

6. And I saw in midst of the throne and of the four living ones, and in midst of the elders, a young lamb having been standing as having been slaughtered, it had horns seven, and eyes seven, they are the seven spirits of the God those having been sent forth into all the earth.

7. And he came and took the scroll from the right of the one sitting on the throne.

8. And when he took the scroll, the four living ones and the twentyfour elders fell down in presence of the lamb, having each one harps, and bowls golden being full of odors, which are the prayers of the holy ones.

9. And they sung a song new, saying: Worthy thou art to receive the scroll, and to open the seals of it; because thou wast slain, and didst buy back for the God us with the blood of thee out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation;

10. and thou didst make them to the God of us kings and priests, and they shall reign on the earth.

11. And I saw, and I heard a voice of messengers many in a circle of the throne and of the living ones and of the elders; and was the number of them myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;

12. saying with a voice great: Worthy is the lamb that having been killed to receive the power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.

13. And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea which is, and the things in them, all, I heard saying: To the one sitting on the throne and to the lamb the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might for the ages of the ages.

14. And the four living ones said: So be it; and the elders fell down and did homage.

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw when opened the lamb one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living ones saying, as a voice of thunder: Come thou and see thou.

2. And I saw, and lo a horse white, and the one sitting on him having a bow; and was given to him a crown, and he came out conquering, and that he might conquer.

3. And when he opened the seal the second, I heard the second living one saying: Come thou.

4. And came out another horse red; and to the one sitting on him it was given to him to take the peace from the earth, and so that each other they might kill; and was given to him a sword great.

5. And when he opened the seal the third I heard the third living one saying: Come thou and see thou. And I saw, and lo a horse black, and the one sitting on him having a balance in the hand of himself.

6. And I heard a voice in midst of the four living ones saying: A small measure of wheat for a denarius; and three small measures of barley for a denarius; and the oil and the wine not thou mayest hurt.

7. And when he opened the seal the fourth, I heard the fourth living one saying: Come and see thou.

8. And I saw, and lo a horse pale, and the one sitting on him, a name to him the Death; and the unseen followed with him; and was given to him authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

9. And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those having been killed because of the word of the God, and because of the testimony which they held;

10. and they cried with a voice great, saying: How long, the sovereign the holy one and true one, not thou judgest and avengest the blood of us from those dwelling on the earth?

11. And was given to them a robe white, and it was said to them, that they should rest yet a time, till should be completed also the fellowslaves of them and the brethren of them, those being about to be killed as even they.

12. And I saw when he opened the seal the sixth, and an earthquake great was, and the sun black became as sackcloth of hair, and the moon whole became as blood,

13. and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth, as a figtree casts the untimely figs of her by a wind great being shaken,

14. and the heaven was separated from as a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island out of the places of themselves were moved;

15. and the kings of the earth and the great ones and the commanders and the rich ones and the strong ones, and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,

16. and they say to the mountains and to the rocks: Fall you on us, and hide you us from face of the one sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb;

17. because came the day the great of the wrath of him; and who is able to stand?

## Revelation 7

1. And after these things I saw four messengers standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that not might blow a wind on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

2. And I saw another messenger rising up from a rising of sun, having a seal of God living; and he cried with a voice great to the four messengers, to whom it was given for them to injure the earth and the sea,

3. saying: Not do you injure the earth, not the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the bondservants of the God of us on the foreheads of them.

4. And I heard the number of those having been sealed, one hundred forty four thousands having been sealed out of every tribe of sons of Israel;

5. out of tribe of Judah, twelve thousands having been sealed; out of tribe of Reuben, twelve thousands having been sealed; out of tribe of Gad, twelve thousands having been sealed;

6. out of tribe of Aser, twelve thousands having been sealed; out of tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousands having been sealed; out of tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousands having been sealed;

7. out of the tribe of Simon, twelve thousand having been sealed; out of tribe of Levi, twelve thousands having been sealed; out of tribe of Issachar, twelve thousands having been sealed;

8. out of tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousands having been sealed; out of tribe of Joseph, twelve thousands having been sealed; out of tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand having been sealed.

9. After these things I saw, and lo a crowd great, which to have numbered him no one was able, out of every nation and of tribes and of peoples and of tongues, standing in presence of the throne and in presence of the lamb, having been clothed robes white, and palms in the hands of them;

10. and they cry with a voice great, saying: The salvation to the God of us to that one sitting on the throne, and to the lamb.

11. And all the messengers stood in a circle of the throne and of the elders and of the four living ones, and fell down before the throne and the faces of themselves, and worshipped the God,

12. saying: So be it; the blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength to the God of us for the ages of the ages; so be it.

13. And answered one of the elders, saying to me: These the ones having been clothed the robes the white, who are they, and whence came they?

14. And I said to him: O lord of me, thou knowest. And he said to me: These are they coming out of the affliction the great, and washed the robes of themselves, and whitened them in the blood of the lamb.

15. On account of this they are in presence of the throne of the God, and publicly serve him day and night in the temple of him; and the one sitting on the throne, pitches his tent over them.

16. Not they will hunger more, neither will they thirst more, nor not may fall on them the sun, nor any heat;

17. because the lamb the in the midst of the throne will tend them, and will them to of life fountains of waters; and will wipe away the God every tear from the eyes of them.

## Revelation 8

1. And when he opened the seal the seventh, was silence in the heaven about half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven messengers, who in presence of the God have stood; and were given to them seven trumpets.

3. And another messenger came, and stood at the altar, having a censer golden; and was given to him incenses many, so that he might give for the prayers of the holy ones of all on the altar the golden that in presence of the throne.

4. And went up the smoke of the incenses with the prayers of the holy ones from hand of the messenger, in presence of the God.

5. And took the messenger the censer, and filled him from the fire of the altar, and cast into the earth; and were voices and thunders and lightnings and an earthquake.

6. And the seven messengers, those having the seven trumpets, prepared themselves, so that they might sound.

7. And the first sounded, and was hail and fire having been mingled with blood, and they were cast into the earth; and the third of the earth was burnt up, and the third of the trees was burnt up, and all grass green was burnt up.

8. And the second messenger sounded, and as it were a mountain great with fire burning was cast into the sea; and became the third of the sea, blood;

9. and died the third of the creatures of the in the sea, things having souls; and the third of the ships was destroyed.

10. And the third messenger sounded, and fell from the heaven a star great burning like a lamp, and it fell on the third of the rivers, and on the fountains of the waters.

11. And the name of the star is called the Wormwood; and became the third of the waters into wormwood; and many of the men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.

12. And the fourth messenger sounded, and was smitten the third of the sun and the third of the moon and the third of the stars, so that might be darkened the third of them, and the day not might shine the third of herself, and the night in like manner.

13. And I saw and I heard one eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a voice great: Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on the earth, from the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three messengers of those being about to sound.

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth messenger sounded, and I saw a star from the heaven having fallen to the earth, and was given to him the key of the pit of the deep;

2. and he opened the pit of the deep. And went up a smoke out of the pit as a smoke of a furnace great, and was darkened the sun and the air by the smoke of the pit.

3. And out of the smoke went out locusts into the earth, and was given them authority as having authority the scorpions of the earth;

4. and it was said to them, that not they should injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, if not the men those who not have the seal of the God on the foreheads of themselves;

5. and it was given to them that not they might kill them, but that they might torment months five; and the torment of them as a torment of a scorpion, when it may strike a man.

6. And in the days those shall seek the men the death, and not not shall find him; and they shall desire to die, and shall flee away from them the death.

7. And the forms of the locusts like to horses having been prepared for war; and on the heads of them as it were crowns golden, and the faces of them as faces of men,

8. and they had hairs as hairs of women, and the teeth of them as of lions were,

9. and they had breastplates as breastplates iron, and the sound of the wings of them as sound of chariots of horses many rushing into battle.

10. And they have tails like to scorpions, and stings was in the tails of them; and the authority of them to injure the men months five.

11. They have over themselves a king the messenger of the deep; a name to him in Hebrew, of Abaddon, and in the Greek a name he has of Apollyon.

12. The woe the one passed away; lo, comes more two woes after these.

13. And the sixth messenger sounded, and I heard voice one from the four horns of the altar of the golden of that in presence of the God,

14. saying to the sixth messenger the one having the trumpet: Loose thou the four messengers those having been bound by the river the great Euphrates.

15. And were loosed the four messengers those having been prepared for the hour and a day and a month and a year, so that they should kill the third of the men.

16. And the number of the armies of the cavalry, two myriads of myriads; I heard the number of them.

17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision and those sitting of them, having breastplates fiery and hyacinthine and brimstonelike; and the heads of the horses as heads of lions, and out of the mouths of them goes out fire and smoke and brimstone.

18. By the three plagues these were killed the third of the men, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone that going forth out of the mouths of them.

19. The for authority of the horses in the mouth of them is, and in the tails of them; the for tails of them like serpents, having heads; and with them they injure.

20. And the remaining ones of the men who not were killed by the plagues these, not reformed from the works of the hands of themselves, so that not they might worship the demons, and the idols the golden ones and the silver ones and the copper ones and the stone ones and the wooden ones, which neither to see are able nor to hear, nor to walk;

21. and not reformed from the murders of themselves, nor from the sorceries of themselves, nor from the fornication of themselves, nor from the thefts of themselves.

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another messenger strong coming down from the heaven, having been clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow on the head of him, and the face of him as the sun, and the feet of him as pillars of fire;

2. and having in the hand of himself a little scroll having been opened; and he placed the foot of himself the right on the sea, the and left on the land;

3. and he cried with a voice great even as a lion roars. And when he cried, spoke the seven thunders the of themselves voices.

4. And when spoke the seven thunders, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from the heaven saying: Seal thou up what spoke the seven thunders, and not these things thou mayest write.

5. And the messenger, whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land, lifted up the hand of himself the right towards the heaven,

6. and he swore by the one living for the ages of the ages, who created the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in her, and the sea and the things in her, because time not yet shall be;

7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he may be about to sound, and be finished the secret of the God, as he announced glad tidings the of himself bondservants the prophets.

8. And the voice which I heard from the heaven, again speaking with me, and saying: Go thou, take thou the little scroll that having been opened in the hand of the messenger of the one standing on the sea and on the land.

9. And I went to the messenger, saying to him, to give to me the little scroll. And he says to me: Take thou and eat thou it; and it will embitter to thee the belly, but in the mouth of thee it will be sweet as honey.

10. And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger, and ate it; and it was in the mouth of me as honey, sweet; and when I ate it, was made bitter the belly of me.

11. And he says to me: It behooves thee again to prophesy to peoples and nations and tongues and kings many.

## Revelation 11

1. And was given to me a reed like to a rod, saying: Rise thou, and measure thou the temple of the God, and the altar, and those worshipping in it;

2. and the court that outside of the temple do thou cast out and not her thou mayest measure, because it was given to the nations; and the city the holy shall they tread months forty two.

3. And I will give to the two witnesses of me, and they shall prophesy days a thousand two hundred sixty, having been clothed with sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands those in presence of the Lord of the earth standing.

5. And if any one them wills to injure, fire proceeds out of the mouth of them, and eats up the enemies of them; and if any one them wills to injure, thus it behooves him to be killed.

6. These have the heaven authority to shut, so that not rain it may rain the days of the prophesy of them; and authority they have over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth, as often as if they should will, with every plague.

7. And when they may finish the testimony of themselves, the wildbeast that rising up out of the deep will make with them war, and will conquer them, and will kill them.

8. And the dead body of them into the street city of the great, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also the Lord of them was crucified.

9. And they took of the peoples and of the tribes and of tongues and of nations the dead body of them days three and a half, and the dead bodies of them not will suffer, to be put into a tomb.

10. And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them, and will be glad, and gifts will send to each other, because these the two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth.

11. And after the three days and a half, breath of life from the God entered in them; and they stood on the feet of themselves, and fear great fell on those beholding them.

12. And they heard a voice great from the heaven, saying to them: Come up hither. And they went up to the heaven in the cloud; and beheld them the enemies of themselves.

13. And in that the hour was an earthquake great, and the tenth of the city fell, and were killed in the earthquake names of men thousands seven; and the remaining ones afraid became, and they gave glory to the God of the heaven.

14. The woe the second passed away; lo, the woe the third comes speedily.

15. And the seventh messenger sounded, and were voices great in the heaven, saying: Became the kingdom of the world, of the Lord of us and of the Anointed of him, and he will reign for the age of the ages.

16. And the twentyfour elders those in presence of the God sitting on the thrones of themselves, fell on the faces of themselves, and worshipped the God,

17. saying: We give thanks to thee, O Lord the God the almighty, the one existing and who was, because thou hast taken the power of thee the great, and reigned.

18. And the nations were angry, and came the wrath of thee, and the season of the dead ones, to be judged and to give the reward to the bondservants of thee the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing the name of thee the small ones and the great ones, and to destroy those destroying the earth.

19. And was opened the temple of the God in the heaven, and was seen the ark of the covenant of the Lord in the temple of him; and were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and hail great.

## Revelation 12

1. And a sign great was seen in the heaven; a woman having been clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath the feet of her, on the head of her a crown of stars twelve,

2. and in womb having she cries out travailing and being pained to bring forth.

3. And was seen another sign in the heaven, and lo a dragon great fieryred, having heads seven and horns ten, and on the heads of him seven diadems;

4. and the tail of him draws the third of the stars of the heaven, and cast them into the earth. And the dragon stood in presence of the woman of that being about to bring forth, so that when she might bring forth, the child of her he might eat up.

5. And she brought forth, a son a male, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod made of iron; and was snatched away the child of her to the God and to the throne of him.

6. And the woman fled into the desert, where she was there a place having been prepared by the God, so that there they might nourish her days a thousand two hundred sixty.

7. And was a war in the heaven; the Michael and the messengers of him of the to have fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and the messengers of him,

8. and not were strong, neither a place was found of them longer in the heaven.

9. And was cast the dragon the great, the serpent the old, the one being called accuser, and the adversary, the one deceiving the inhabitable whole, was cast into the earth, and the messengers of him with him were cast.

10. And I heard a voice great in the heaven, saying: Now came the salvation and the power and the kingdom of the God of us, and the authority of the Anointed of him; because was cast down the accuser of the brethren of us, the one accusing them in presence of the God of us day and night;

11. and they overcame him through the blood of the lamb, and through the word of the testimony of themselves; and not they loved the life of themselves till death.

12. Because of this rejoice you the heavens and those in them tabernacling: Woe to the earth and to the sea, because went down the accuser to you, having wrath great, knowing, that a little season he has.

13. And when saw the dragon, that he was cast into the earth, he pursued the woman who brought forth the male.

14. And were given to the woman two wings of the eagle the great, so that she might fly into the desert into the place of herself, where she is nourished there a season and seasons and half of a season, from face of the serpent.

15. And cast the serpent out of the mouth of herself after the woman water as a river, so that her borne a long by a river he might cause.

16. And helped the earth the woman, and opened the earth the mouth of herself, and drank up the river, which cast the dragon out of the mouth of himself.

17. And was enraged the dragon against the woman, and went away to make war with the remaining ones of the seed of her, of those keeping the commandments of the God, and having the testimony of Jesus.

## Revelation 13

1. And I placed on the sand of the sea. And I saw out of the sea a wildbeast coming up, having horns ten and heads seven, and on the horns of him ten diadems, and on the heads of him names of blasphemy.

2. And the wildbeast which I saw, was like to a leopard, and the feet of him as of a bear, and the mouth of him as a mouth of a lion. And gave to him the dragon the power of himself, and the throne of himself, and authority great.

3. And one of the heads of him as if having been slain to death; and the stroke of the death of him was healed. And wondered whole the earth after the wilds beast,

4. and they did homage to the dragon, because he gave the authority to the wildbeast, and they did homage to the wildbeast, saying: Who like to the wildbeast? and who is able to make war with him?

5. And was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and was given to him authority to act months forty two.

6. And he opened the mouth of himself for blasphemy against the God, to blaspheme the name of him, and the tabernacle of him, and those in the heaven, tabernacling.

7. And it was given to him war to make with the holy ones, and to overcome them; and was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.

8. And will worship him all those dwelling on the earth, of which not has been written the name in the scroll of the life of the lamb of that having been killed, from a casting down of a world.

9. If any one has an hear, let him hear.

10. If any one captivity leads together, into captivity he shall be led; if any one with a sword will kill, it is necessary him with a sword to be killed. Here is the patient endurance and the faith of the holy ones.

11. And I saw another wildbeast coming up out of the earth, and he had horns two like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.

12. And the authority of the first wildbeast all he does in presence of him; and he makes the earth and those in her dwelling that they should worship the wilds beast the first, of whom was healed the stroke of the death of him;

13. and he makes signs great, and fire so that out of the heaven it may come down into the earth, in presence of the men.

14. And he deceives those dwelling on the earth, by means of the signs which it was given to him to do in presence of the wildbeast; saying to those dwelling on the earth, to make an image to the wildbeast, which has the stroke of the sword and lived.

15. And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the wildbeast, so that both should speak the image of the wildbeast, and should cause, as many as not would do homage to the image of the wildbeast that they should be killed.

16. And hew causes all, the little ones and the great ones, and the rich ones and the poor ones, and the freedom and the bondmen, that they should give to them a mark on the hand of them the right, or on the forehead of them;

17. and that no one may be able to buy or to sell, if not the one having the mark, the name of the wildbeast, or the number of the name of him.

18. Here the wisdom is; the one having a mind, let him compute the number of the wildbeast; a number for of a man it is, and the number of him six hundred and sixtysix.

## Revelation 14

1. And I saw, and lo the lamb having been standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred fortyfour thousands, having the name of him and the name of the Father of him having been written on the foreheads of themselves.

2. And I heard a voice out of the heaven as a voice of waters many, as a voice of thunder great; and the voice which I heard, as of harpers harping on the harps of themselves.

3. And they sing a song new in presence of the throne, and in presence of the four living ones, and of the elders; and no one was able to learn the song, if not the hundred fortyfour thousands, those having been bought from the earth.

4. There are, those with women not were defiled; virgins for they are; these are those following the lamb where ever he may go; these were bought from the men a fruitfruit to the God and to the lamb;

5. and in the mouth of them not was found falsehood; without blame for they are.

6. And I saw another messenger flying in midheaven, having glad tidings agelasting to proclaim those sitting on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;

7. saying with a voice great: Fear you the God and give you to him glory, because is come the hour of the judgment of him; and worship you the one having made the heaven and the earth and the sea and fountains of water.

8. And another messenger followed, saying: It is fallen, is fallen Babylon the great; because of the wine of the wrath of the fornication of herself she was given to drink all nations.

9. And another messenger third followed them, saying with a voice great: If any one worships the wildbeast and the image of him, and receives a mark on the forehead of himself, or on the hand of himself;

10. even he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of the God, of that having been mingled unmixed in the cup of the anger of him, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in presence of the holy messengers and in presence of the lamb.

11. And smoke of the torment of them for ages of ages rises up; and not they have rest day and night those worshipping the wildbeast and the image of him, and if any one receives the mark of the name of him.

12. Here patient endurance of the holy ones is, those keeping the commandments of the God, and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice out of the heaven, saying: Write thou: Blessed ones the dead ones those in Lord dying from hence forth; yes, says the spirit, so that they may rest from the labors of themselves; the but works of them follows with them.

14. And I saw, and lo a cloud white, and on the cloud sitting like a son of man, having on the head of himself a crown golden, and in the hand of himself a sickle sharp.

15. And another messenger came forth out of the temple, crying with a voice great to the one sitting on the cloud: Send thou the sickle of thee, and reap thou, because is come the hour of the to reap, because is dry the harvest of the earth.

16. And cast the one sitting on the cloud the sickle of himself on the earth; and was reaped the earth.

17. And another messenger came forth out of the temple of that in the heaven, having also himself a sickle sharp.

18. And another messenger came forth out of the altar, having authority over the fire; and he called with a cry great to the one having the sickle the sharp, saying: Send thou of thee the sickle the sharp, and cut off thou the clusters of the vine of the earth, because are ripened the grapes of her;

19. and cast the messenger the sickle of himself into the earth, and was cut off the vine of the earth, and cast into the winepress of the wrath of the God the great.

20. And was trodden the winepress outside of the city, and came forth blood out of the winepress even to the bridles of the horses from furlongs a thousand six hundred.

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in the heaven great and wonderful, messengers seven, having plagues seven the last ones, because in them was finished the wrath of the God.

2. And I saw as a sea glassy having been mingled with fire, and those being conquerors of the wildbeast and of the image of him, and of the number of the name of him, standing on the sea the glassy having harps of the God.

3. And they sing the song of Moses a bondservant of the God, and the song of the lamb, saying: Great and wonderful the works of thee, O Lord the God the almighty, just and true the ways of thee, the king of the nations;

4. who not not may fear thee, O Lord, and may glorify the name of thee? because alone bountiful; because all the nations shall come and shall worship in presence of thee; because the righteous acts of thee were manifested.

5. And after these things I saw, and was opened the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven;

6. and came out the seven messengers those having the seven plagues out the temple, having been clothed linen pure bright, and having been girt round about the breasts girdles golden.

7. And one of the four living ones gave to the seven messengers seven bowls golden, being full of the wrath of the God of that one living for the ages of the ages.

8. And was full the temple of smoke from the glory of the God and from the power of him; and no one was able to enter into the temple, till should be finished the seven plagues of the seven messengers.

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a voice great out of the temple, saying to the seven messengers: Go you forth and do you pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of the God into the earth.

2. And went forth the first, and poured out the bowl of himself on the land; and was an ulcer bad and evil on the men those having the mark of the wildbeast, and those doing reverence of the image of him.

3. And the second messenger poured out the bowl of himself into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead one, and every soul of life died in the sea.

4. And the third poured out the bowl of himself into the rivers and into the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.

5. And I heard the messenger of the waters saying: Righteous art thou, the one existing and who was, the bountiful one, because these things thou hast judged;

6. because blood of holy ones and of prophets they poured out, and blood to them thou gavest to drink; worthy they are.

7. And I heard the altar saying: Yes, O Lord the God the almighty, true and righteous the judgments of thee.

8. And the fourth poured out the bowl of himself on the sun; and was given to him to burn the men in fire.

9. And were burned the men heat great, and blasphemed the name of the God of that having authority over plagues these; and not they reformed to give to him glory.

10. And the fifth poured out the bowl of him on the throne of the wildbeast. And became the kingdom of him darkened; and they bit the tongues of themselves because of the anguish,

11. and they blasphemed the God of the heaven because of the pains of themselves and because of the ulcers of themselves; and not they reformed from the works of themselves.

12. And the sixth poured out the bowl of himself on the river the great Euphrates; and was dried up the water of it, so that might be prepared the way of the kings of those from risings of a sun.

13. And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wildbeast and out of the mouth of the false prophet spirits three unclean as frogs;

14. (they are for spirits of demons working signs;) which go forth to the kings of the habitable whole, to gather together them for the war of the day of that of the great of the God of the almighty.

15. (Lo, I come as a thief; blessed the one watching, and keeping the garments of himself, so that not naked he may walk, and they may see the shame of him.)

16. And he gathered together them into the place that being called in Hebrew Armageddon.

17. And the seventh poured out the bowl of himself on the air; and came forth a voice great from the temple of the heaven, from the throne, saying: It has been done.

18. And were lightnings and voices and thunders, and an earthquake was great, such not was from of which the men were on the earth, so great an earthquake so great.

19. And was the city the great into three parts, and the cities of the nations feel; and Babylon the great was remembered before the God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of the anger of himself;

20. and every island fled away, and mountains not were found,

21. and hail great as if weighing a talent comes down out of the heaven on the men; and blasphemed the men the God on account of the plague of the hail, because great is the plague of her exceedingly.

## Revelation 17

1. And came one of the seven messengers of those having the seven bowls, and spoke with me, saying: Come hither, I will show to thee the judgment of the harlot the great, of that sitting on the waters the many;

2. with whom committed fornication the kings of the earth, and were made drunk those inhabiting the earth with the wine of the fornication of her.

3. And he carried away me into a desert in spirit; and I saw a woman sitting on a wild best scarlet, being full of names of blasphemy, having heads seven and horns ten.

4. And the woman was having clothed purple and scarlet, and having been gilded with gold and a stone precious and pearls having golden a cup in the hand of herself being full of abomination, and the uncleannesses of the fornication of herself,

5. and on the forehead of herself a name having been written: Mystery: Babylon the great, the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth.

6. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the holy ones, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I wondered, having seen her a wonder great.

7. And said to me the messenger: Why didst thou wonder? I to thee will tell the secret of the woman, and of the wildbeast of that bearing her, of that having the seven heads and the ten horns.

8. The wildbeast which thou sawest, was, and not is, and is about to come up out of the abyss, and into destruction to go; and will wonder those dwelling on the earth, of whom not has been written the names on the scroll of the life from a casting down of a world, beholding the wildbeast because he was, and not is, and will be present.

9. Here the mind the one having wisdom. The seven heads, seven mountains are, where the woman sits on them.

10. And kings seven are; the five fell, the one is, the other not yet is come, and when he may have come, a little him behooves to remain.

11. And the wildbeast, which was, and not is, even he eighth is, and out of the seven is, and into destruction goes.

12. And the ten horns which thou sawest, ten kings are, who a kingdom not yet received, but authority as kings one hour they receive with the wildbeast.

13. These one have purpose, and the power and the authority of themselves to the wild best they give.

14. These with the lamb will make war; and the lamb will overcome them, because a Lord of lords he is and a king of kings; and those with him, called ones and chosen ones and faithful ones.

15. And he says to me: The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, peoples and crowds are, and nations and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the wildbeast, these will hate the harlot, and having made desolate will make her even naked, and the flesh of her will eat, and her will burn with fir.

17. The for God gave into the hearts of them, to have done the purpose of him, and to have done purpose one, and to give the kingdom of themselves to the wildbeast, till shall be finished the words of the God.

18. And the woman which thou sawest, is the city the great that having kingship over the kings of the earth.

## Revelation 18

1. And after these things I saw another messenger coming down from the heaven, having authority great; and the earth was illuminated from the glory of him.

2. And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: It is fallen, is fallen, Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a haunt of every spirit impure, and a haunt of every bird unclean and having been hated;

3. because by the wine of the wrath of the fornication of her has been drunken all the nations, and the kings of the earth with her fornicated, and the merchants of the earth by the power of the luxuries of her were enriched.

4. And I heard another voice from the heaven, saying: Come you out from her, the people of me, so that not you may participate with the sins of her, and from the plagues of her so that not you may receive;

5. because adhered together of her the sins even to the heaven, and remembered the God the unjust acts of her.

6. Give you to her, as also she gave, and double you to her double according to the works of her; in the cup which she mixed, do you mix to her double;

7. how much she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, so much give you to her torment and mourning. Because in the heart of herself she says: I sit a queen, and a widow not I am, and mourning not not I may see;

8. on account of this in one day will come the plagues of her, death and mourning and famine; and with fire will be burnt up; because strong Lord the God the one having judged her.

9. And shall weep and shall wail over her the kings of the earth, those with her having fornicated and having lived luxuriously, when they may see the smoke of the burning of her,

10. from at a distance having stood on account of the fear of the torment of her, saying: Woe, woe, the city great, Babylon the city the strong, because in one hour came the judgment of thee.

11. And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because the cargo of them no one buys any more;

12. cargo of gold and of silver, and of stone of value and of pearl, and of fine cotton and of purple, and of silk and of scarlet; and all wood aromatic, and every vessel ivory, and every vessel of wood most precious and of copper and of iron and of marble;

13. and cinnamon, and amomum, and odors, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and finest flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies; and lives of men.

14. And the fruit season of the earnest desire of the soul of thee went away from thee, and all the dainty things and the splendid things perished from thee, and no longer not not thou mayest find them.

15. The merchants of these things those having been enriched from her, from at a distance shall stand, because of the fear of the torment of her, weeping and mourning,

16. and saying: Woe, Woe, the city the great, that having been clothed fine cotton and purple and scarlet, and being gilded with gold and stone precious and pearls; because in one hour is laid waste the so great wealth.

17. And every pilot, and every one who to a place sailing, and sailors, and as many as the sea work, from at a distance stood,

18. and cried out beholding the smoke of the burning of her, saying: What like to the city to the great?

19. and they cast dust on the heads of themselves, and cried out weeping and mourning, saying: Woe, woe, the city the great, by which were enriched all those having ships on the sea by the preciousness of her, because in one hour she was made desolate.

20. Rejoice thou over her, O heaven, and the holy ones and the apostles and the prophets, because judged the God the judgment of you on her.

21. And took up one messenger strong a stone as a millstone great, and cast into the sea, saying: Thus with violence shall be cast down Babylon the great city, and not not may be found any more.

22. And a voice of harpers and of musicians and of fluteplayers and of trumpeters not not may be heard in thee longer, and every artisan of every art not not may be found in thee longer, and a sound of a millstone not not may be heard in thee longer, and a light of lamp not not may shine in thee longer,

23. and a voice of bridegroom and of bride not not may be heard in thee longer; because the merchants of thee were the great ones of the earth, because by the magical arts of thee were deceived all the nations.

24. And in thee bloods of prophets and of holy ones was found, even of all of those having been killed on the earth.

## Revelation 19

1. After these things I heard as a voice great of a crowd large in the heaven, saying: Praise the Lord; the salvation and the glory and the power of the God of us;

2. because true and righteous the judgment of him; because he judged the harlot the great, which corrupted the earth with the fornication of herself, and avenged the blood of the bondservants of himself from hand of her.

3. And a second time they have said: Praise the Lord, and the smoke of her rise up for the ages of the ages.

4. And fell down the elders those twentyfour, and the four living ones, and did homage to the God to the one sitting on the throne, saying: So be it; praise the Lord.

5. And a voice from the throne came forth, saying: Praise you the God of us all the bondservants of him, and those fearing him the little ones and the great ones.

6. And I heard as a voice of a crowd great, and as a sound of waters many, and as a voice of thunders strong, saying: Praise the Lord; because reigned Lord the God of us, the almighty.

7. We should rejoice and we should exult, and we should give the glory to him; because came the marriage of the lamb, and the wife of him prepared herself;

8. and it was given to her, so that she might be clothed with fine cotton bright and clean. (The for fine cotton, the righteous acts is of the holy ones.)

9. And he says to me: Write thou: Blessed ones those into the supper of the marriage of the lamb having been called. And he says to me: These the words true are of the God.

10. And I fell before the feet of him to worship him; and he says to me: See not; a fellowbondservant of thee I am, and of the brethren of thee of those having the testimony of the Jesus; to the God do thou give worship. (The for testimony of the Jesus, is the spirit of the prophecy.)

11. And I saw the heaven having been opened, and lo a horse white, and the one sitting on him, being called faithful and true, and in righteousness he judges and makes war;

12. the but eyes of him as a flame of fire, and on the head of him diadems many; having a name having been written which no one knows, if not himself;

13. and having been clothed with a mantle having been dipped in blood; and is called the name of him: The word of the God.

14. And the armies those in the heaven followed him on horse white, having been clothed with fire cotton white clean.

15. And out of the mouth of him goes forth a broadsword sharp, so that with her he may smite the nations, and he shall tend them with a rod iron; and he treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath of the anger of the God of the almighty one.

16. And he has on the mantle and on the thigh of himself a name having been written: King of kings and Lord of lords.

17. And I saw one messenger standing in the sun; and he cried with a voice great, saying to all to the birds to those flying in midheaven: Come you, be you assembled for the supper the great of the God,

18. so that you may eat flesh of kings and flesh of commanders and flesh of strong ones, and flesh of horses and of those sitting on them, and flesh of all freemen both and bondmen, and little ones and great ones.

19. And I saw the wildbeast and the kings of the earth and the armies of them having assembled, to make war with the one sitting on the horse and with the army of him.

20. And was caught the wildbeast, and the with him falseprophet the one having done the signs in presence of him, by which he deceived those having received the mark of the wildbeast, and those doing homage to the image of him; living were cast the two into the lake of the fire that burning with brimstone.

21. And the remaining ones were killed with the broadsword of the one sitting on the horse, with the one going forth out of the mouth of him; and all the birds were filled with the flesh of them.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven, having the key of the deep, and a chain great on the hand of himself.

2. And he seized the dragon, the serpent the old, who is an accuser and an adversary, and he bound him a thousand years,

3. and he cast him into the deep, and shut up and sealed over him, so that not he might deceive longer the nations, till might be ended the thousand years and after these it behooves him to be loosed a little time.

4. And I saw thrones; and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them; and the souls of those having been cut with an axe because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of the God, and who not worshipped the wildbeast not the image of him, and not received the mark on the forehead and on the hand of themselves; and they lived, and they reigned with the Anointed one the thousand years.

5. The but remaining ones the dead ones not lived till should be ended the thousand years. This the resurrection the first.

6. Blessed and holy the one having a portion in the resurrection the first; over such ones the second death not has authority, but they shall be priests of the God and of the Anointed one, and they shall reign with him a thousand years.

7. And when they may be ended the thousand years, shall be loosed the adversary out of the prison of himself;

8. and he shall go forth to deceive the nations those in the four corners of the earth, the Gog and the Magog, to assemble them for war, of whom the number of them as the sand of the sea.

9. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encircled the camp of the holy ones, and the city the beloved; and came down fire out of the heaven from the God, and ate up them;

10. and the accuser the one deceiving them, was cast into the lake of the fire and of the brimstone, where both the wildbeast and the falseprophets; and they will be tormented day and night for the ages of the ages.

11. And I saw a throne great white, and the one sitting on him, of whom from face fled the earth and the heaven, and a place not was found for them.

12. And I saw the dead cues, little ones and great ones, having stood in presence of the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is of the life; and were judged the dead ones out of the things having been written in the books, according to the works of them.

13. And gave up the sea the dead ones those in her, and the death and the invisible gave up the dead ones those in them; and were judged each one according to the works of themselves.

14. And the death and the invisible were cast into the lake of the fire; this the death the second is.

15. And if any one not was found in the book of the life having been written, was cast into the lake of fire.

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a heaven new and earth new; the for first heaven and the first earth were gone, and the sea not is longer.

2. And the city the holy, Jerusalem new I saw coming down out of the heaven, from the God having been prepared as a bride having been adorned for the husband of herself.

3. And I heard a voice great out of the heaven, saying: Lo, the tabernacle of the God with the men, and will tabernacle with them, and they a people of him shall be, and himself the God with them will be, a God of them;

4. and he will wipe away every tear from the eyes of them, and the death not shall be longer; neither mourning nor crying nor pain not shall be longer; because the first things passed away.

5. And said the one sitting on the throne: Lo, new all things I make. And he says to me: Write thou; because these the words faithful ones and true ones are.

6. And he said to me: I has been done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I to the one thirsting will give from of the fountain of the water of the life gratis;

7. the one overcoming shall inherit these things, and I will be to him a God, and he shall be to me the son.

8. To the but cowards and faithless ones, and abominable ones, and murderers and fornicators, and sorcerers and idolaters, and all the liars, the portion of them in the lake in that burning with fire and brimstone, which is the death the second.

9. And came one of the seven messengers of those having the seven bowls those being full of the seven plagues the last ones, and talked with me, saying: Come thou, I will show to thee the bride of the lamb the wife.

10. And he bore away me in spirit to a mountain great and high, and he showed me the city the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from the God,

11. having the glory of the God; the luminary of her like to a stone most precious, as to a stone jasper being crystalline,

12. having a wall great and high, having gates twelve, and at the gates messengers twelve, and names having been written, which is the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

13. From east, gates three; from North, gates three; from South gates three; from west, gates three.

14. And the wall of the city had foundations twelve, and on them, twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb.

15. And the one talking with me, had a measure a reed golden, so that he might measure the city, and the gates of her, and the wall of her.

16. And the city fourangled is placed, and the length of her as much as even the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed to furlongs twelve thousands; the length and the breadth and the height of her equal is.

17. And he measured the wall of her one hundred fortyfour cubits, a measure of a man, which is of a messenger.

18. And was the building of the wall of her, jasper; and the city gold pure like to glass pure.

19. And the fountains of the wall of the city with every stone precious having been adorned; the foundation the first, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

20. the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates, twelve pearls; in one of each of the gates was of one pearl. And the broad place of the city, gold pure as glass transparent.

22. And a temple not I saw in her; the for Lord the God the almighty a temple of her is, and the lamb.

23. And the city not need has of the sun nor of the moon, so that they may shine in her; the for glory of the God enlightened her, and the lamp of her the lamb.

24. And shall walk the nations by means of the light of her. And of the kings of the earth bring the glory and the honor of themselves into her;

25. and the gates of her not not may be shut day; (night for not will be there;)

26. and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into her.

27. And not not may enter into her every thing common, and doing an abomination and a falsehood; if not those having been written in the scroll of the of life of the lamb.

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed to me a river of water of life bright as a crystal, proceeding out of the throne of the God and of the lamb.

2. In midst of the broad place of her and of the river on this side and on that side a wood of life, bearing fruits twelve, according to month each one yielding the fruit of itself; and the leaves of the wood for healing of the nations.

3. And every curse not shall be longer; and the throne of the God of the lamb in her shall be; and the bondservants of him shall publicly serve him;

4. and they shall see the face of him, and the name of him on the foreheads of them.

5. And night not shall be longer; and no need of lamp and of light of sun, because Lord the God will shine on them; and they shall reign for the ages of the ages.

6. And he said to me: These the words faithful ones and true ones; and Lord the God of the spirits of the prophets sent the messenger of himself to show to the bondservants of himself, the things it behooves to have done with speed.

7. And lo, I come speedily; blessed the one keeping the words of the prophecy of the scroll this.

8. And I John the one hearing and seeing these things; and when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the messenger the one showing to me these things.

9. And he says to me: See not; a fellowbondservant of thee I am, and of the brethren of thee of the prophets, and of those keeping the words of the scroll this; to the God give thou reverence.

10. And he says to me: Not thou mayest seal the words of the prophecy of the scroll this; the season near is.

11. The one acting unjustly let him be unjust still, and the filthy one let him be filthy still; and the righteous one righteousness let him do still, and the holy one let him be holy still.

12. Lo, I come speedily, and the reward of me with me, to give back to each one as the work of him shall be.

13. I the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

14. Blessed those doing the commandments of him, so that shall be the authority of them over the wood of the life, and by the gates they may enter into the city.

15. Outside the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and murderers and the idolaters, and every one the one loving and doing falsehood.

16. I Jesus sent the messenger of me to testify to you these things to the congregations; I am the root and the offspring of David, the star the bright the morning.

17. And the spirit and the bride say: Come thou; and the one hearing let him say: Come thou; and the one thirsting let him come, the one willing let him take water of life gratis.

18. Testify I to all to the one hearing the words of the prophecy of the scroll this. If any one may add to them, will add the God to him the plagues those having been written in the scroll this;

19. and if any one may take away from the words of the scroll of the prophecy this, will take the God the portion of him from the wood of the life, and out of the city the holy, of those having been written in the scroll this.

20. He says the one testifying these things: Yes I come speedily. So be it, come thou, O Lord Jesus.

21. The favor of the Lord Jesus Anointed, with all of the holy ones.
