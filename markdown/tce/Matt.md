# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:

2. Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,

3. and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,

4. Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,

5. Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,

6. and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,

7. Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa,

8. Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,

9. Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,

10. Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah,

11. and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

12. And after the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,

13. Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,

14. Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,

15. Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,

16. and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.

17. So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.

18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.

19. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to put her to public shame, was resolved to divorce her quietly.

20. But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, »Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.

21. And she will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.«

22. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:

23. »Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,and they shall call his name Immanuel,«which means, »God with us.«

24. When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife,

25. but did not know her until she had borne a son. And he called his name Jesus.

## Matthew 2

1. Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,

2. saying, »Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.«

3. When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

4. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

5. So they said to him, »In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:

6. But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;for out of you shall come a rulerwho will be the shepherd of my people Israel.«

7. Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from them what time the star had appeared.

8. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, »Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and worship him.«

9. When they had heard the king they went their way; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came to rest over the place where the child was.

10. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

11. On coming into the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh.

12. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.

13. Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, »Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.«

14. When he rose, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt,

15. and remained there until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, »Out of Egypt have I called my son.«

16. Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.

17. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:

18. »A voice was heard in Ramah,lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.«

19. But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

20. saying, »Rise, take the young child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead.«

21. And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.

22. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,

23. and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled, »He shall be called a Nazarene.«

## Matthew 3

1. In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,

2. and saying, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«

3. For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, »The voice of one crying in the wilderness:Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.«

4. Now John wore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him,

6. and confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

7. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bear fruit worthy of repentance,

9. and do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.

10. Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

11. I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

12. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.«

13. Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.

14. But John tried to prevent him, saying, »I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?«

15. But Jesus answered him, »Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.« Then he consented.

16. And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him.

17. And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«

## Matthew 4

1. Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

2. And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he was hungry.

3. And the tempter came and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.«

4. But he answered, »It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone,but by every word that proceedsfrom the mouth of God.«

5. Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,

6. and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, He will give his angels charge of you,and In their hands they will bear you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.«

7. Jesus said to him, »Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«

8. Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.

9. And he said to him, »All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.«

10. Then Jesus said to him, »Away, Satan! for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your Godand him only shall you serve.«

11. Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.

12. Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.

13. And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,

14. that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:

15. »The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles

16. the people who sat in darknesshave seen a great light,and on those who sat in the region and shadow of deathlight has dawned.«

17. From that time Jesus began to preach and say, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«

18. As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

19. And he said to them, »Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.«

20. Immediately they left their nets and followed him.

21. Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them,

22. and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.

23. And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.

24. Then his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.

25. Great crowds followed himfrom Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.

## Matthew 5

1. Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him.

2. And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:

3. »Blessed are the poor in spirit,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

4. Blessed are those who mourn,for they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed are the meek,for they shall inherit the earth.

6. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,for they shall be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful,for they shall obtain mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart,for they shall see God.

9. Blessed are the peacemakers,for they shall be called sons of God.

10. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11. Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake.

12. Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

13. »You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its taste, how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.

14. You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.

15. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.

16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.

17. »Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

18. For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished.

19. Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

20. For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.

21. »You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.

22. But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be answerable to the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of hell.

23. Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,

24. leave your gift there before the altar, and go. First be reconciled to your brother; and then come and offer your gift.

25. Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him to court, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.

26. Truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.

27. »You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery.

28. But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

30. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.

31. »It has also been said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.

32. But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to become an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

33. »Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.

34. But I say to you, do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is Gods throne;

35. or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.

36. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.

37. Simply let your Yes be Yes, and your No, No; anything more than this comes from evil.

38. »You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

39. But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. But if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

40. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.

41. And if someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.

42. Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.

43. »You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

44. But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,

45. that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

46. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?

47. And if you greet only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?

48. You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

## Matthew 6

1. »Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

2. »Thus, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

3. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,

4. so that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

5. »And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

6. But when you pray, go into your room, shut the door and pray to your Father, who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.

7. And when you pray, do not use empty repetitions as the Gentiles do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.

8. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

9. Pray, then, in this way: Our Father in heaven,hallowed be your name.

10. Your kingdom come,your will be doneon earth as it is in heaven.

11. Give us this day our daily bread.

12. And forgive us our debts,as we also have forgiven our debtors.

13. And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.

14. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

15. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

16. »And when you fast, do not look gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

17. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,

18. so that you do not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

19. »Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,

20. but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

21. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

22. The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.

23. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

24. No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

25. »Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?

26. Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?

27. Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his span of life?

28. And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin,

29. yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

30. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

31. Therefore do not worry, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?

32. For the Gentiles seek after all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.

33. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you as well.

34. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

## Matthew 7

1. »Judge not, that you be not judged.

2. For with the same judgment you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

3. And why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?

4. Or how can you say to your brother, Let me take the speck out of your eye, when there is a plank in your own eye?

5. You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye.

6. Do not give what is holy to the dogs; do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.

7. »Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

8. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.

9. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?

10. Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?

11. If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!

12. So whatever you wish that men would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

13. »Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it.

14. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and few are those who find it.

15. »Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.

16. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?

17. Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

18. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.

19. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

20. Thus you will know them by their fruits.

21. »Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

22. On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?

23. And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers!

24. »Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

25. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.

26. And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand;

27. and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell. And great was its fall.«

28. And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,

29. for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.

## Matthew 8

1. When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.

2. And behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.«

3. Then Jesus put out his hand and touched him, saying, »I am willing; be clean.« Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus said to him, »See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.«

5. When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help,

6. and saying, »Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress.«

7. And Jesus said to him, »I will come and heal him.«

8. But the centurion answered him, »Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But only say the word, and my servant will be healed.

9. For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«

10. When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, »Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.

11. I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.

12. But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«

13. Then to the centurion Jesus said, »Go; be it done for you as you have believed.« And his servant was healed at that very hour.

14. When Jesus come into Peters house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.

15. He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him.

16. When evening had come, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed. And he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.

17. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: »He took up our infirmitiesand bore our diseases.«

18. Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.

19. Then a certain scribe came and said to him, »Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.«

20. And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«

21. Another of the disciples said to him, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«

22. But Jesus said to him, »Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.«

23. And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.

24. And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But he was asleep.

25. The disciples went and woke him, saying, »Lord, save us! We are perishing!«

26. And he said to them, »Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?« Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.

27. And the men marveled, saying, »What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?«

28. When he had come to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.

29. And behold, they cried out, »What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?«

30. Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them.

31. And the demons begged him, »If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.«

32. And he said to them, »Go.« So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the water.

33. Then those who kept them fled, and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.

34. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.

## Matthew 9

1. And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own city.

2. And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, »Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.«

3. And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, »This man is blaspheming!«

4. But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, »Why do you think evil in your hearts?

5. For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?

6. But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he then said to the paralytic»Rise, take up your bed and go home.«

7. And he rose and went home.

8. When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.

9. As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, »Follow me.« And he rose and followed him.

10. And as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

11. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, »Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?«

12. But when Jesus heard it, he said, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.

13. But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.«

14. Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, »Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?«

15. And Jesus said to them, »Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn as long as he is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.

16. No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.

17. Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; if they do, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and so both are preserved.«

18. While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, »My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and she will live.«

19. So Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.

20. And behold, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment.

21. For she said to herself, »If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well.«

22. Jesus turned, and when he saw her he said, »Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.« And the woman was made well from that moment.

23. When Jesus came to the rulers house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,

24. he said, »Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.« And they laughed at him.

25. But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.

26. And the report of this went through all that region.

27. And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, »Have mercy on us, Son of David.«

28. When he had entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, »Do you believe that I am able to do this?« They said to him, »Yes, Lord.«

29. Then he touched their eyes, saying, »According to your faith be it done to you.«

30. And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, »See that no one knows it.«

31. But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.

32. As they were going out, behold, a mute and demon-possessed man was brought to him.

33. And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, »Never was anything like this seen in Israel.«

34. But the Pharisees said, »He casts out demons by the prince of demons.«

35. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.

36. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

37. Then he said to his disciples, »The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.

38. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.«

## Matthew 10

1. And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.

2. The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

4. Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

5. These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them: »Do not go among the Gentiles, or enter any town of the Samaritans.

6. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And preach as you go, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

8. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.

9. Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts,

10. nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.

11. Now whatever village or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go out.

12. As you enter the house, give it your greeting.

13. And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.

14. And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.

15. Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.

16. »Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.

17. But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues.

18. You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

19. But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour;

20. for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.

21. Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.

22. And you will be hated by all for my names sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.

23. When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

24. »A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.

25. It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!

26. »So do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.

27. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.

28. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Fathers will.

30. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.

32. »Therefore whoever acknowledges me before men, him I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.

33. But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.

34. »Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

35. For I have come to set a man against his father,and a daughter against her mother,and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;

36. and a mans enemies will be those of his own household.

37. He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;

38. and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.

39. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.

40. »He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.

41. He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophets reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward.

42. And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.«

## Matthew 11

1. And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.

2. Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples

3. and said to him, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«

4. And Jesus answered them, »Go and tell John what you hear and see:

5. the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.

6. And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«

7. As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

8. But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.

9. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

10. For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.

11. Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

12. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force.

13. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

14. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come.

15. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

16. »But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,

17. We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.

18. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.

19. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her deeds.«

20. Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.

21. »Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.

23. And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven?You shall be brought down to Hades.For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

24. But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.«

25. At that time Jesus declared, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes.

26. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.

27. »All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

28. Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

30. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.«

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.

2. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, »Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.«

3. He said to them, »Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him:

4. how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?

5. Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are innocent?

6. I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.

7. And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.

8. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.«

9. And he went on from there, and went into their synagogue.

10. And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they asked him, »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?« so that they might accuse him.

11. He said to them, »What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?

12. Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.«

13. Then he said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other.

14. But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might destroy him.

15. Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all,

16. and ordered them not to make him known.

17. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:

18. »Behold, my servant whom I have chosen,my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased!I will put my Spirit upon him,and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.

19. He will not quarrel or cry out;nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.

20. A bruised reed he will not break,and a smoldering wick he will not quench,till he sends forth justice to victory;

21. and in his name will the Gentiles hope.«

22. Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and saw.

23. And all the people were amazed and said, »Could this be the Son of David?«

24. But when the Pharisees heard this they said, »It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.«

25. Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, »Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

26. If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?

27. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.

28. But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

29. Or how can one enter a strong mans house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.

30. He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.

31. Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.

32. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.

33. »Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.

34. You brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.

36. But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.

37. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.«

38. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, »Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.«

39. But he answered them, »An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

40. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

41. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.

42. The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.

43. »When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.

44. Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came. And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.

45. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.«

46. While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.

47. Someone told him, »Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.«

48. But he replied to the man who told him, »Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?«

49. And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!

50. For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.«

## Matthew 13

1. That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.

2. And great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the shore.

3. Then he told them many things in parables, saying: »A sower went out to sow his seed.

4. And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.

5. Some fell on rocky places, where they did not have much soil, and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of soil.

6. But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away.

7. Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.

8. But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

9. He who has ears, let him hear.«

10. The disciples came and said to him, »Why do you speak to them in parables?«

11. And he answered them, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.

12. For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.

13. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

14. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: Hearing you will hear and shall not understand;and seeing you will see and not perceive.

15. For this peoples heart has grown dull.And their ears are hard of hearing,and their eyes they have closed,lest they should see with their eyes,and hear with their ears,and they understand with their hearts,and turn so that I should heal them.

16. But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.

17. For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.

18. »Hear then the parable of the sower:

19. when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.

20. But he who received the seed on rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;

21. yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.

22. Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

23. But the one who received seed on the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.«

24. Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;

25. but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.

26. So when the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.

27. And the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?

28. He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?

29. But he said, No, lest while you gather up the weeds you also root up the wheat with them.

30. Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers. Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.«

31. Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;

32. it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.«

33. He told them another parable: »The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened.«

34. All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; and without a parable he did not speak to them.

35. So was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: »I will open my mouth in parables,I will utter things hiddensince the foundation of the world.«

36. Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, »Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.«

37. He answered, »He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;

38. the field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,

39. and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.

40. Therefore as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.

41. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil,

42. and will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

43. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

44. »Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and then in his joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

45. »Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,

46. who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.

47. »Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind;

48. which, when it was full, they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.

49. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous

50. and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«

51. Jesus asked, »Have you understood all these things?« »Yes,« they said to him.

52. And he said to them, »Therefore every scribe who has been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.«

53. When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.

54. And coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, »Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?

55. Is this not the carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?

56. And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?«

57. And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.«

58. And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,

2. and he said to his servants, »This is John the Baptist, he has risen from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.«

3. For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife,

4. because John had said to him, »It is not lawful for you to have her.«

5. And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.

6. But when Herods birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,

7. so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.

8. Prompted by her mother, she said, »Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.«

9. And the king was sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded it to be given to her;

10. so he sent and had John beheaded in prison.

11. And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.

12. Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.

13. Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.

14. When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.

15. When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, »This is a remote place, and its already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.«

16. Jesus said, »They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.«

17. They said to him, »We have only five loaves here and two fish.«

18. He said, »Bring them here to me,«

19. Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the multitudes.

20. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.

21. Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

22. Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.

23. And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,

24. but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.

25. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.

26. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, »It is a ghost!« And they cried out for fear.

27. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«

28. And Peter answered him, »Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.«

29. So he said, »Come«. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.

30. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, »Lord, save me!«

31. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, »O you of little faith, why did you doubt?«

32. And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

33. Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, »Truly you are the Son of God.«

34. When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.

35. And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,

36. and begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.

## Matthew 15

1. Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,

2. »Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.«

3. He answered them, »And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?

4. For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.

5. But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God

6. he is not to honor his father with it. Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.

7. You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:

8. These people honor me with their lips,but their heart is far from me.

9. In vain do they worship me,teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.«

10. And he called the people to him and said to them, »Hear and understand:

11. not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.«

12. Then the disciples came and said to him, »Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?«

13. He answered, »Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.

14. Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.«

15. But Peter said to him, »Explain the parable to us.«

16. So Jesus said, »Are you also still without understanding?

17. Do you not yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?

18. But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.

19. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornications, theft, false witness, slander.

20. These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.«

21. And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried to him, »Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.«

23. But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, »Send her away, for she is crying out after us.«

24. He answered, »I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.«

25. But she came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, help me!«

26. And he answered, »It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«

27. »Yes, Lord,« she said, »yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.«

28. Then Jesus answered her, »O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.« And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

29. And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there.

30. Then great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.

31. So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.

32. Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, »I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.«

33. Then his disciples said to him, »Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd?«

34. And Jesus said to them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven, and a few small fish.«

35. He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.

36. Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.

37. And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.

38. Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.

39. And he sent away the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.

## Matthew 16

1. Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.

2. He answered them, »When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.

3. And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.

4. A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.« So he left them and departed.

5. When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.

6. Then Jesus said to them, »Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.«

7. And they discussed among themselves, saying, »It is because we have taken no bread.«

8. But Jesus, aware of this, said, »O men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?

9. Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?

10. Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?

11. How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«

12. Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13. When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that the Son of Man is?«

14. And they said, »Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.«

15. He said to them, »But who do you say that I am?«

16. Simon Peter answered, »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.«

17. And Jesus answered him, »Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.

18. And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

19. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.«

20. Then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.

21. From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.

22. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, »Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!«

23. But he turned and said to Peter, »Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«

24. Then Jesus said to his disciples, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

25. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

26. What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?

27. For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each man according to what he has done.

28. Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.«

## Matthew 17

1. After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.

2. And he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.

3. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.

4. And Peter said to Jesus, »Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«

5. While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a voice from the cloud said, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!«

6. When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe.

7. But Jesus came and touched them and said, »Rise. Dont be afraid.«

8. And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.

9. And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, »Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.«

10. And the disciples asked him, »Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«

11. Jesus replied, »Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.

12. But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.«

13. Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.

14. And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said,

15. »Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.«

17. Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.«

18. And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that moment.

19. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, »Why could we not cast it out?«

20. So he said to them, »Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.«
