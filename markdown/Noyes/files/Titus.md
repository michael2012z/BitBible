# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Christ Jesus, for the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,

2. in hope of everlasting life, which God, who cannot lie, promised from the most ancient times,

3. but in his own seasons manifested his word through the preaching with which I was intrusted by the commandment of God our Saviour:

4. to Titus, true child after the common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.

5. For this cause I left thee behind in Crete, that thou shouldst set in order the things that are wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed thee;

6. if any one is without reproach, the husband of one wife, having believing children, that are not accused of dissoluteness, or unruly.

7. For a bishop must be without reproach, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not a striker, not greedy of base gain,

8. but hospitable, a lover of what is good, discreet, just, holy, temperate,

9. holding fast the sure word according to what he was taught, that he may be able by sound teaching both to exhort, and to refute the gainsayers.

10. For there are many unruly vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision;

11. whose mouths must be stopped, since they overturn whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of base gain.

12. One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said: "The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slothful gluttons."

13. This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,

14. not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

15. To the pure all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled.

16. They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and for every good work reprobate.

## Titus 2

1. But do thou speak the things which become sound teaching;

2. that aged men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;

3. that aged women likewise be in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good,

4. that they may teach the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,

5. to be discreet, chaste, workers at home, good, in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

6. The younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded;

7. in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works, in teaching showing uncorruptness, gravity,

8. sound speech that cannot be condemned; that he that is opposed to us may be put to shame, having no evil thing to say of us.

9. Exhort bond-servants to be in subjection to their own masters, in all things to be well-pleasing to them,

10. not contradicting, not purloining, but showing all good faith; that they may adorn the teaching of God our Saviour in all things.

11. For the grace of God, that bringeth salvation to all men, was manifested,

12. teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in the present world;

13. looking for the blessed hope, and appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ;

14. who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a people to be his own, zealous in good works.

15. These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.

## Titus 3

1. Put them in mind to submit themselves to governments, to authorities, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work,

2. to speak evil of no one, to be averse to strife, forbearing, showing all meekness to all men.

3. For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, going astray, slaves to divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.

4. But when the kindness and love for men of God our Saviour appeared,

5. not by works of righteousness which we did, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the bath of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit,

6. which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour,

7. that having been accepted as righteous by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of everlasting life.

8. True is the saying; and these things I desire that thou affirm earnestly, that they who have believed in God may be careful to practise good works. These things are good and profitable to men;

9. but avoid foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and contentions about the Law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

10. A man that stirs up divisions, after a first and second admonition, avoid;

11. knowing that he that is such is utterly perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.

12. When I shall have sent Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, use diligence to come to me to Nicopolis; for there I have determined to pass the winter.

13. Zenas the lawyer and Apollos forward on their journey diligently, that nothing may be wanting to them.

14. And let those also who belong to us learn to practise good works for the necessary wants that arise, that they may not be unfruitful.

15. All that are with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
