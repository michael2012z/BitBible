## Matthew 1

1. The genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.

2. Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.

3. And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah, by Tamar. And Pharez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;

4. and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;

5. and Salmon begat Boaz by Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed by Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse;

6. and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon by the wife of Uriah.

7. And Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;

8. and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;

9. and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;

10. and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;

11. and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the removal to Babylon.

12. And after the removal to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;

13. and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;

14. and Azor begat Zadok; and Zadok begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;

15. and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;

16. and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

17. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the removal to Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the removal to Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.

19. Then Joseph her husband, being righteous, and not willing to expose her to shame, purposed to put her away privately.

20. But while he thought on these things, lo! an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.

21. And she will bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins.

22. Now all this took place, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

23. "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel;" that is, when interpreted, God-is with-us.

24. Then Joseph, on waking up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife;

25. and he knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name Jesus.

## Matthew 2

1. Now when Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, lo! there came magians from the East to Jerusalem,

2. saying, Where is the king of the Jews that hath been born? for we saw his star in the East, and came to do him homage.

3. But when Herod the king heard of these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;

4. and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

5. And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written by the prophet:

6. "And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come a ruler, who shall feed my people Israel."

7. Then Herod, having privately called the magians ascertained from them exactly the time when the star appeared.

8. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search carefully for the child; and when ye have found him, bring me word, that I also may go and do him homage.

9. When they had heard the king, they departed. And lo! the star, which they had seen in the East, went before them, till it came and stood over where the child was.

10. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy;

11. and when they had come into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and did homage to him; and opening their treasures, they presented him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

12. And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.

13. And when they had gone, lo! an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I speak to thee; for Herod will seek the child, to destroy him.

14. And he arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt;

15. and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "I called my son out of Egypt."

16. Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the magians, was greatly enraged; and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the magians.

17. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,

18. "A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they were no more."

19. But when Herod was dead, lo! an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

20. saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel; for they who sought the child’s life are dead.

21. And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

22. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,

23. and came and took up his abode in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, "He will be called a Nazarene,"

## Matthew 3

1. In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,

2. saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

3. For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths!"

4. And John himself had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country about the Jordan;

6. and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance,

9. and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

10. And already is the axe lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that beareth not good fruit is to be cut down, and cast into the fire.

11. I indeed baptize you in water, for repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.

12. His winnowing-shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.

13. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.

14. But John opposed him, saying, I have need to be baptized by thee, and dost thou come to me?

15. And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.

16. And Jesus, as soon as he was baptized, went up from the water; and, lo! the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God, descending like a dove, coming upon him.

17. And lo! a voice from the heavens, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."

## Matthew 4

1. Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the Devil.

2. And when he had tasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.

3. And the tempter came and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread.

4. But he answered and said, It is written, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God."

5. Then the Devil taketh him into the holy city, and setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple;

6. and saith to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, "He will give his angels charge concerning thee; and in their hands they will bear thee up, that thou mayst not dash thy foot against a stone."

7. Jesus said to him, Again it is written, "Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God."

8. Again, the Devil taketh him m an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;

9. and said to him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

10. Then saith Jesus to him, Be gone, Satan! for it is written, "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."

11. Then the Devil leaveth him; and lo! angels came and ministered to him.

12. Now when Jesus heard that John had been cast into prison, he withdrew into Galilee.

13. And leaving Nazara, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, on the shore of the lake, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;

14. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

15. "The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the lake beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,

16. the people that sat in darkness, saw a great light; and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light arose."

17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

18. And while walking by the lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the lake; for they were fishers.

19. And he saith to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. And they immediately left their nets, and followed him.

21. And going on from thence, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

22. And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.

23. And he went round the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

24. And his fame went forth into all Syria; and they brought to him all that were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were possessed by demons, and lunatics, and those who were struck with palsy; and he healed them.

25. And great multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.

## Matthew 5

1. And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him.

2. And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying:—

3. Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

4. Blessed are the meek; for they will inherit the earth.

5. Blessed are they who mourn; for they will be comforted.

6. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they will be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful; for they will obtain mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they will see God.

9. Blessed are the peace-makers; for they will be called sons of God.

10. Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11. Blessed are ye, when men revile you, and persecute you, and say every thing that is bad against you, falsely, for my sake.

12. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so did they persecute the prophets that were before you.

13. Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall itself be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men.

14. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid;

15. nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand; and it giveth light to all that are in the house.

16. In like manner let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

17. Think not that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.

18. For truly do I say to you, Not till heaven and earth pass away, shall one jot or one tittle pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled.

19. Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

20. For I say to you, Unless your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

21. Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, "Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the Judges."

22. But I say to you, that whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the Judges; and whoever shall say to his brother, Simpleton! shall be in danger of the Council; and whoever shall say, Fool! shall be in danger of hell-fire.

23. Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee,

24. leave there thy gift before the altar, and go away; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

25. Agree with thine adversary at law quickly, while thou art on the road with him; lest the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.

26. Truly do I say to thee, Thou wilt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.

27. Ye have heard that it was said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery."

28. But I say to you, that whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

29. And if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

30. And if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, than that thy whole body should go away into hell.

31. And it was said, "Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement."

32. But I say to you, that whoever putteth away his wife, unless it be on account of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoever shall marry her when put away, committeth adultery.

33. Again ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, "Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths."

34. But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;

35. nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King;

36. nor shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.

37. But let your language be, Yea, yea; Nay; nay; for whatever is more than these cometh of evil.

38. Ye have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."

39. But I say to you, that ye resist not the evil-doer; but whoever smiteth thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also;

40. and if any one intends to sue thee at the law, and take thy coat, give up to him thy cloak also;

41. and whoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.

42. Give to him that asketh of thee; and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not away.

43. Ye have heard that it was said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy."

44. But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you;

45. that ye may become sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

46. For if ye love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same?

47. And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye that excelleth? Do not even the heathen the same?

48. Be ye therefore perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

## Matthew 6

1. But take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen by them; otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.

2. Therefore when thou doest alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly do I say to you, They have received their reward.

3. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;

4. that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee.

5. And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly do I say to you, They have received their reward.

6. But do thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and, when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee.

7. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for the multitude of their words.

8. Be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

9. After this manner therefore pray ye:—Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name;

10. thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven;

11. give us this day our daily bread;

12. and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors;

13. and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

14. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;

15. but if ye do not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

16. Moreover, when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly do I say to you, They have received their reward.

17. But do thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;

18. that thou appear not to men to be fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee.

19. Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where the moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;

20. but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumeth, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

21. For where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.

22. The eye is the lamp of the body. If thine eye he clear, thy whole body will be in light;

23. but if thine eye be disordered, thy whole body will be in darkness. If then the light that is within thee is darkness, how great that darkness!

24. No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or else he will cleave to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

25. Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?

26. Behold the birds of the air, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much greater value than they?

27. But who of you by anxious thought can add to his life one cubit?

28. And why are ye anxious about raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin;

29. and yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.

30. And if God so clothes the herbage of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into an oven, will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

31. Therefore be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we he clothed?

32. For after all these things do the gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

33. But seek first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will also be given you.

34. Be not then anxious about the morrow; for the morrow will be anxious about itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.

## Matthew 7

1. Judge not, that ye be not judged.

2. For with what judgment ye judge, ye will be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it will be measured to you.

3. And why dost thou look at the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, and not perceive the beam in thine own eye?

4. Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me take the mote out of thine eye; when, lo! the beam is in thine own eye?

5. Hypocrite! first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then wilt thou see clearly to take the mote out of thy brother’s eye.

6. Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn upon you and rend you.

7. Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and ye will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

8. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door will be opened.

9. Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask for bread, will give him a stone?

10. or, if he ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?

11. If ye then, though evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him!

12. All things, then, whatever ye would that men should do to you, do ye also so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.

13. Enter in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction; and many are they who go in thereat.

14. For strait is the gate, and narrow the way, that leadeth to life; and few are they who find it.

15. Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.

16. Ye may know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

17. So every good tree beareth good fruit; but a bad tree beareth bad fruit.

18. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor call a bad tree bear good fruit.

19. Every tree that beareth not good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.

20. So then ye may know them by their fruits.

21. Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.

22. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name work many miracles?

23. And then will I declare to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

24. Every one then that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock;

25. and the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.

26. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;

27. and the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell; and great was its fall.

28. And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching.

29. For he taught them as having authority, and not as their scribes.

## Matthew 8

1. When he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.

2. And lo! there came a leper and bowed down before him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.

3. And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus saith to him, See thou tell no one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

5. And when he had entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,

6. and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home palsied, sorely tormented.

7. He saith to him, I will come and heal him.

8. But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but only command with a word, and my servant will be made well.

9. For even I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

10. When Jesus heard this, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly do I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such faith.

11. And I say to you, that many will come from the east and the west, and recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.

12. But the sons of the kingdom will go out into the outer darkness; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And the servant was made well in that hour.

14. And when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.

15. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and waited on him.

16. And when evening came, they brought to him many that were possessed by demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick;

17. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, "He himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."

18. And Jesus, seeing great multitudes about him, gave orders to depart to the other side.

19. And a certain scribe came and said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.

20. And Jesus saith to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have lodging-places; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

21. And another of the disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

22. But he saith to him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.

23. And when he had gone on board the boat, his disciples followed him.

24. And, lo! a great tempest arose on the lake, so that the boat was almost covered by the waves; but he was sleeping.

25. And they came and awoke him, saying, Lord, save! we are perishing.

26. And he saith to them, Why are ye fearful, ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the waves; and there was a great calm.

27. And the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the waves obey him?

28. And when he had come to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass by that way.

29. And lo! they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Son of God? Didst thou come here to torment us before the time?

30. Now there was at a distance from them a herd of many swine feeding.

31. And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.

32. And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine. And lo! the whole herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and perished in the waters.

33. And the herdsmen fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what had happened to the men possessed by demons.

34. And lo! the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they besought him to depart from their borders.

## Matthew 9

1. And going on board a boat, he crossed over, and came to his own city.

2. And lo! they brought to him a man that was palsied, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the palsied man, Be of good cheer, son; thy sins are forgiven.

3. And lo! some of the scribes said within themselves, This man is blaspheming.

4. And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said, Wherefore have ye evil thoughts in your hearts?

5. For which is easier? to say, Thy sins are forgiven? or to say, Arise, and walk?

6. But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority on earth to forgive sins,—then he saith to the palsied man,—Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house.

7. And he arose, and went away to his house.

8. And when the multitudes saw it, they were struck with fear, and gave glory to God, who had given such power to men.

9. And as Jesus passed on from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the custom-house; and he saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.

10. And it came to pass, as he was reclining at table in the house, lo! many publicans and sinners came and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.

11. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why doth your teacher eat with the publicans and sinners?

12. But when he heard that, he said, They who are well do not need a physician, but they who are sick.

13. But go ye and learn what this meaneth: "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice." For I came not to call righteous men, but sinners.

14. Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples fast not?

15. And Jesus said to them, Can the companions of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then will they fast.

16. No one putteth a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment; for the piece that filleth in teareth away from the garment, and a worse rent is made.

17. Nor do men put new wine into old skins; else the skins burst, and the wine runneth out, and the skins are spoilt. But they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.

18. While he was thus speaking to them, lo! a certain ruler came in and bowed down before him, saying, My daughter just now died; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she will live.

19. And Jesus arose and followed him, with his disciples.

20. And, lo! a woman, who had had an issue of blood for twelve years, came up behind, and touched the fringe of his garment.

21. For she said within herself, If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well.

22. And he turned round, and seeing her, said, Be of good cheer, daughter; thy faith hath made thee well. And the woman was made well from that hour.

23. And Jesus coming into the ruler’s house, and seeing the minstrels, and the crowd making a noise,

24. said, Withdraw; for the girl is not dead, but is sleeping. And they laughed him to scorn.

25. But when the crowd had been put out, he went in, and took hold of her hand; and the girl arose.

26. And the report of this went abroad into all that country.

27. And as Jesus passed on from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, Have pity on us, Son of David!

28. And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus saith to them, Do ye believe that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yea, Lord.

29. Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to you.

30. And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them, saying, See that no one know it.

31. But they went out, and spread abroad his fame in all that country.

32. And as they were going out, lo! they brought to him a dumb man, possessed by a demon.

33. And when the demon was cash out, the dumb man spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, Never was the like seen in Israel.

34. But the Pharisees said, He casteth out the demons through the prince of the demons.

35. And Jesus went round all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease.

36. And seeing the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered about, as sheep having no shepherd.

37. Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few.

38. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers for his harvest.

## Matthew 10

1. And he called to him his twelve disciples, and gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every sickness and every disease.

2. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus;

4. Simon of Cana, and Judas Iscariot, he who betrayed him.

5. These twelve Jesus sent forth, when he had charged them, saying, Go not away to gentiles, and enter not any city of the Samaritans;

6. but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And, as ye go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

8. Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons; freely ye received, freely give.

9. Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, in your girdles;

10. nor bag for the journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor a staff. For the laborer is worthy of his living.

11. And into whatever city or town ye enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye leave the place.

12. And as ye enter the house, salute it.

13. And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

14. And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.

15. Truly do I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.

16. Lo! I send you forth as sheep into the midst of wolves. Be therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

17. But beware of men. For they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

18. and ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, that ye may bear testimony to them and to the gentiles.

19. But when they deliver you up, be not anxious as to how or What ye shall speak; for it will be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.

20. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.

21. And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against their parent, and put them to death;

22. and ye will be hated by all on account of my name. But he that endureth to the end will be saved.

23. And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. For truly do I say to you, Ye will not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man hath come.

24. A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.

25. It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they so call those of his household!

26. Fear them not therefore. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hid, that will not be known.

27. What I say to you in darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim ye upon the housetops.

28. And fear not those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father.

30. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.

32. Every one therefore who shall acknowledge me before men, him will I also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.

33. But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.

34. Think not that I came to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

35. For I came to set a man at variance with his father, and a daughter with her mother, and a bride with her mother-in-law;

36. and they of a man’s own household will be his foes.

37. He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me;

38. and he that doth not take his cross, and follow me, is not worthy of me.

39. He that findeth his life will lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake will find it.

40. He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.

41. He that receiveth a prophet because he is a prophet, will receive a prophet’s reward, and he that receiveth a righteous man because he is a righteous man, will receive a righteous man’s reward.

42. And whoever shall give to drink only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple, truly do I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.

## Matthew 11

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of his charge to his twelve disciples, that he departed thence, to teach and to preach in their cities.

2. And John, having heard in the prison of the works of Christ, sent by his disciples,

3. and said to him, Art thou he that is to come, or are we to look for another?

4. And Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John what ye hear and see.

5. The blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and to the poor good tidings are brought;

6. and blessed is he, whoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.

7. And, as these were going, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? the reeds shaken by the wind?

8. But why did ye go out? to see a man clothed in soft raiment? Lo! they that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.

9. But why did ye go out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

10. For this is he of whom it is written: "Lo! I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee."

11. Truly do I say to you, Among those born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist. But he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

12. And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent seize upon it.

13. For all the Prophets and the Law, until John, prophesied.

14. And if ye are willing to receive it, he is the Elijah who was to come.

15. He that hath ears, let him hear.

16. But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, who call to their fellows,

17. and say, We piped to you, and ye did not dance; we sung a dirge, and ye did not lament.

18. For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He hath a demon.

19. The Son of man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her works.

20. Then he began to upbraid the cities wherein most of his miracles were done, because they did not repent.

21. Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

23. And thou, Capernaum! shalt thou be exalted to heaven? Thou shalt be brought down to the underworld; for if the miracles which were done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

24. But I say to you, that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

25. At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning, thou didst reveal them to babes.

26. Yea, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.

27. All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no one knoweth the Son but the Father; nor doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it is the will of the Son to reveal him.

28. Come to me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest for your souls.

30. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the grain-fields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of grain, and to eat.

2. But the Pharisees, seeing it, said to him, Lo! thy disciples are doing that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.

3. But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he and those who were with him were hungry?

4. how he went into the house of God, and they ate the show-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests alone?

5. Or have ye not read in the Law, that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?

6. But I say to you, that something greater than the temple is here.

7. But if ye had known what this meaneth, "I desire mercy and not sacrifice," ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

8. For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.

9. And departing thence, he went into their synagogue.

10. And, lo! there was a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.

11. And he said to them, Who of you that owneth one sheep, if it fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it, and lift it out?

12. Of how much more worth now is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do well on the sabbath.

13. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored sound as the other.

14. Then the Pharisees went out, and consulted together against him, how they might destroy him.

15. But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from thence; and many followed him; and he healed them all,

16. and strictly charged them not to make him known;

17. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

18. "Behold my servant, whom I chose; my beloved, with whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will declare judgment to the nations.

19. He will not strive, nor cry aloud, nor will any one hear his voice in the streets.

20. A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

21. And in his name will nations hope."

22. Then was brought to him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.

23. And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Is this the son of David?

24. But the Pharisees, hearing it, said, This man doth not cast out the demons, except through Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.

25. And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and no city or house divided against itself will stand.

26. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?

27. And if I cast out the demons through Beelzebul, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore shall they be judges of you.

28. But if I cast out the demons through the Spirit of God, then hath the kingdom of God already come to you.

29. Or how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and seize upon his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then plunder his house?

30. He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

31. Therefore I say to you, All manner of sin and evil-speaking will be forgiven to men; but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.

32. And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this world, or in the world to come.

33. Either say that the tree is good, and its fruit good; or say that the tree is bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. Brood of vipers!

34. How can ye, evil as ye are, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

35. The good man, from his good treasure, bringeth out good things; and the evil man, from his evil treasure, bringeth out evil things.

36. And I say to you, that for every idle word that men shall speak, they will give account in the day of judgment.

37. For by thy words thou wilt be justified, and by thy words thou wilt be condemned.

38. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from thee.

39. But he answered and said to them, A wicked and adulterous generation is seeking for a sign; and no sign will be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.

40. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

41. The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, lo! something more than Jonah is here.

42. The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo! something more than Solomon is here.

43. But when the unclean spirit is gone out from a man, it goeth through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.

44. Then it saith, I will return to my house whence I came out. And on coming, it findeth it empty, and swept, and put in order.

45. Then it goeth and taketh with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. So will it be also with this wicked generation.

46. While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, lo! his mother and his brothers were standing without, seeking to speak with him.

47. And one said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers are standing without, seeking to speak with thee.

48. But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?

49. And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples, be said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!

50. For whoever doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.

## Matthew 13

1. The same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the shore of the lake;

2. and great multitudes were gathered together to him, so that he went into a boat, and sat down; and all the multitude stood on the beach.

3. And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow.

4. And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them.

5. And others fell upon rocky places, where they had not much earth; and they sprung up immediately, because they had no depth of earth.

6. But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

7. And others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked them.

8. And others fell upon good ground; and yielded fruit, some a hundred fold, some Sixty, some thirty fold.

9. He that hath ears, let him hear.

10. And the disciples came and said to him, Why dost thou speak to them in parables?

11. He answered and said, Because to you it hath been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it hath not been given.

12. For whoever hath, to him will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever hath not, from him will be taken away even what he hath.

13. Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, nor understand.

14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, "Ye will hear indeed, and not understand; and ye will see indeed, and not perceive.

15. For this people’s heart hath become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn from their ways, and I should heal them."

16. But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.

17. Truly do I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and did not see them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and did not hear them.

18. Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

19. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, the Evil One cometh, and snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart; this man is what was sown by the wayside.

20. And what was sown on the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with joy,

21. but, having no root within him, endureth only for a time; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth on account of the word, he immediately falleth away.

22. And what was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

23. And what was sown on the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who also beareth fruit, and yieldeth, one a hundred fold, another sixty, another thirty fold.

24. Another parable he put forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.

25. But while men slept, his enemy came, and sowed tares among the wheat; and went away.

26. But when the blade grew up, and put forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

27. So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? Whence then hath it tares?

28. He said to them, An enemy did this. The servants say to him, Dost thou wish then that we go and gather them up?

29. But he said, Nay; lest, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.

30. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles, to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.

31. Another parable he put forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field.

32. Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.

33. Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

34. All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables, and without a parable he spoke nothing to them;

35. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation [of the world]."

36. Then he sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.

37. He answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.

38. The field is the world; the good seed is the sons of the kingdom; but the tares are the sons of the Evil One;

39. the enemy that sowed them is the Devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.

40. As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the world.

41. The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks, and those who do iniquity,

42. and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

43. Then will the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.

44. The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy thereof he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls.

46. And having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, cast into the sea, and bringing together fish of every kind;

48. which, when it was full, they drew upon the beach, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.

49. So will it be at the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,

50. and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

51. Did ye understand all these things? They say to him, Yea.

52. And he said to them, Thus then every scribe, instructed for the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder, who bringeth out from his storehouse things new and old.

53. And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these parables, that he departed thence.

54. And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and the miracles?

55. Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?

56. And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?

57. And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.

58. And he did not work many miracles there, because of their unbelief.

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

2. and said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he hath risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.

3. For Herod had seized John, and bound him, and put him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.

4. For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

5. And wishing to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.

6. But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod;

7. whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.

8. And she, being set on by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.

9. And the king was sorry; but on account of his oaths, and of those at table with him, he ordered it to be given,

10. and sent and beheaded John in the prison.

11. And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel; and she brought it to her mother.

12. And his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.

13. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew thence in a boat into a desert place apart; and the multitudes hearing of it followed him on foot from the cities.

14. And when he came forth he saw a great multitude; and he was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.

15. And when it was evening, the disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and it is now late; send the multitudes away therefore, that they may go to the villages and buy themselves victuals.

16. But he said to them, They need not go away; do ye give them food.

17. And they say to him, We have here only five loaves, and two fishes.

18. He said, Bring them hither to me.

19. And bidding the multitudes to lie down on the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he blessed; and having broken the loaves he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

20. And they all ate, and were filled. And they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full.

21. And they who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

22. and he constrained the disciples to get into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.

23. And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.

24. But the boat was now in the midst of the lake, tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.

25. And in the fourth watch of the night, he went to them, walking on the lake.

26. And seeing him walking on the lake, they were dismayed, saying, It is a spectre; and they cried out for fear.

27. But he immediately spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.

28. And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.

29. And he said, Come. And Peter, coming down from the boat, walked on the water, and came to Jesus.

30. But seeing the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!

31. And Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and said to him, Thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?

32. And when they had got into the boat, the wind ceased.

33. And they that were in the boat fell down before him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.

34. And crossing over, they came to land, to Gennesaret.

35. And the men of that place, when they saw who he was, sent out into all that country round, and brought to him all the diseased,

36. and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched were made well.

## Matthew 15

1. Then come to Jesus Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem, saying,

2. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

3. But he answered and said to them, Why do ye too transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?

4. For God commanded, saying, "Honor thy father and thy mother;" and, "He that curseth father or mother, let him surely die."

5. But ye say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever thou mightst receive in aid from me is a gift [to God],

6. he shall not honor his father or his mother. Thus have ye made void the law of God for the sake of your tradition.

7. Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying,

8. "This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

9. But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."

10. And calling the multitude, he said to them, Hear, and understand.

11. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

12. Then come the disciples, and say to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard that saying?

13. But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant will be rooted up.

14. Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a ditch.

15. And Peter answering said to him, Explain to us that dark saying.

16. And he said, Are ye too still without discernment?

17. Do ye not understand, that whatever entereth the mouth goeth into the stomach, and is cast out into the drain?

18. But the things which proceed from the mouth come out of the heart; and these defile a man.

19. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimony, blasphemies.

20. These are the things which defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man.

21. And Jesus, going from thence, withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And, lo! a woman of Canaan came out from those borders, and cried out, saying, Have compassion on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously afflicted with a demon.

23. But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying Send her away, for she is crying out after us.

24. But he answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. Then she came and fell down before him, saying, Lord, help me!

26. But he answering said, It is not allowable to take the children’s bread, and throw it to the little dogs.

27. And she said, Yea, Lord; for the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.

28. Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it done to thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was cured from that hour.

29. And departing thence, Jesus came near the lake of Galilee; and going up the mountain, he sat down there.

30. And great multitudes came to him, having with them those who were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them;

31. so that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed sound, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they gave glory to the God of Israel.

32. And Jesus having called his disciples to him, said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have remained with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint on the road.

33. And the disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

34. And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.

35. And bidding the multitude to lie down on the ground,

36. he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

37. And they all ate, and were filled; and they took up of the fragments that remained, seven baskets full.

38. And they who ate were four thousand men, besides children and women.

39. Then he sent away the multitudes, and went on board the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.

## Matthew 16

1. And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to try him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.

2. And he answering said to them, When it is evening, ye say, Fair weather! for the sky is red.

3. And in the morning, A storm today! for the sky is red and lowering. Ye know how to judge of the face of the sky, and can ye not discern the signs of the times?

4. A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and no sign will be given to it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them and went away.

5. And the disciples having come to the other side, had forgotten to take bread.

6. And Jesus said to them, Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

7. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we took no bread.

8. And Jesus knowing it, said, Why are ye reasoning among yourselves, ye of little faith, because ye took no bread?

9. Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

10. Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

11. How is it that ye do not understand, that I spoke not to you of loaves? But [I said] Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

12. Then they understood, that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13. And Jesus, having come into the region of Caesarea Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is?

14. And they said, Some, John the Baptist; but some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. He saith to them, But who do ye say that I am?

16. And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

17. And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonah; for flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.

18. And I on my part say to thee, that thou art Peter, a rock, and on this rock will I build my church, and the gates of the underworld shall not prevail against it.

19. I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever thou shalt loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

20. Then he charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.

21. From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and rise again on the third day.

22. Then Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord! This shall not be to thee.

23. But he turned and said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan! thou art my stumbling-block; for thy thoughts are not on the things of God, but on those of men.

24. Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any one chooseth to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

25. For whoever chooseth to save his life will lose it; and whoever shall lose his life for my sake will find it.

26. For what will a man be profited, if be gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life?

27. For the Son of man is to come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then will he render to every one according to his works.

28. Truly do I say to you, There are some of those standing here who will not taste of death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

## Matthew 17

1. And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart.

2. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun; and his garments became white as the light.

3. And lo! there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.

4. And Peter answering said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if thou wilt, I will make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

5. While he was yet speaking, lo! a bright cloud overshadowed them; and lo! a voice out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; hear him."

6. And the disciples hearing it, fell on their face, and were exceedingly afraid.

7. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.

8. And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.

9. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell what hath been seen to no one, until the Son of man hath risen from the dead.

10. And the disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?

11. And he answering said, Elijah indeed cometh, and will restore all things.

12. But I say to you, that Elijah hath already come, and they knew him not, but did with him whatever they would. So also is the Son of man to suffer by them.

13. Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.

14. And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

15. Lord, have compassion on my son; for he is a lunatic, and is sorely afflicted; for he often falleth into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

17. Then Jesus answering said, Unbelieving and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.

18. And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him; and the boy was cured from that hour.

19. Then the disciples came to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?

20. And he said to them, Because of your want of faith. For truly do I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it will remove; and nothing will be impossible to you.

21. And while they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,

22. and they will put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again. And they were greatly grieved.

23. And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel?

24. He saith, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes? Of their own sons, or of strangers?

25. And when he said, Of strangers, Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free.

26. But that we may not give them offence, go to the lake, and cast a hook, and take the fish that first cometh up; and on opening his mouth, thou wilt find a shekel; take that, and give it to them for me and thee.

## Matthew 18

1. At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

2. And he called a child to him, and set him in the midst of them,

3. and said, Truly do I say to you, Unless ye are changed, and become as children, ye will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

4. Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

5. And whoever receiveth one such child in my name, receiveth me.

6. But whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me to fall away, it were better for him to have a great millstone hung round his neck, and be swallowed up in the depth of the sea.

7. Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks! For it must needs be that stumbling-blocks come; but woe to the man through whom the stumbling-block cometh!

8. And if thy hand or thy foot is causing thee to fall, cut it off, and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed or lame, than having two hands, or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire.

9. And if thine eye is causing thee to fall, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.

10. Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, that their angels in heaven continually behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.

11. What think ye? if a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them hath gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains, and go and seek that which hath gone astray?

12. And if it happen that he find it, truly do I say to you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

13. Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.

14. Moreover, if thy brother sin, go and reprove him between thee and him alone. If he listen to thee, thou hast gained thy brother;

15. but if he do not listen, take with thee one or two more; that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.

16. And if he disregard them, tell the matter to the church; but if he disregard the church also, let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican.

17. Truly do I say to you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever ye shall loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

18. Again, I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing that they shall ask, it will be done for them by my Father o who is in heaven.

19. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

20. Then came Peter, and said to him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?

21. Jesus saith to him, I say not to thee, until seven times, but until seventy times seven.

22. Therefore the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who would settle accounts with his servants.

23. And when he had begun to reckon, there was brought to him one, who owed him ten thousand talents.

24. But as he was unable to pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.

25. Then that servant fell down and did obeisance to him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

26. And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.

27. But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denaries; and he laid hold of him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest.

28. His fellow-servant then fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.

29. And he would not; but went away and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.

30. Then his fellow-servants, seeing what was done, were greatly grieved; and went and told their lord all that had been done.

31. Then his lord, having called him, saith to him, Thou wicked servant! All that debt I forgave thee because thou didst beseech me;

32. shouldst not thou also have had pity on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?

33. And his lord was enraged, and delivered him to the inflicters of punishment, till he should pay all that was due to him.

34. So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass, that when Jesus had ended these sayings, he removed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea, beyond the Jordan.

2. And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

3. And the Pharisees came to him, trying him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

4. And he answering said, Have ye not read, that he who made them at the beginning, made them male and female?

5. And He said: "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh."

6. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God joined together, let not man put asunder.

7. They say to him, Why then did Moses ordain that a man may give his wife a writing of divorcement, and put her away?

8. He saith to them, Moses, on account of your hardness of heart, allowed you m put away your wives; but in the beginning it was not so.

9. And I say to you, Whoever putteth away his wife, except for fornication, and marrieth another, committeth adultery.

10. The disciples say to him, If such be the case of a man with his wife, it is not good to marry.

11. But he said to them, All cannot receive this saying, but they only to whom it is given.

12. For there are eunuchs, who were so born from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

13. Then there were brought to him children, that be might lay his hands on them, and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.

14. But Jesus said to them, Suffer the children, and forbid them not to come to me; for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.

15. And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

16. And lo! one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have everlasting life?

17. And he said to him, Why dost thou ask me concerning what is good? There is but one who is good. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

18. Which? saith he. And Jesus said, These: "Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;

19. Honor thy father and thy mother;" and, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

20. The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept; in what am I still wanting?

21. Jesus said to him, If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

22. But the young man, on hearing this went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.

23. Then Jesus said to his disciples, Truly do I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

24. And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

25. And the disciples, hearing this, were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?

26. But Jesus, fixing his eyes on them, said, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

27. Then Peter answering said to him, Lo! we left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?

28. And Jesus said to them, Truly do I say to you, that, in the renovation when the Son of man sitteth on the throne of his glory, ye who have followed me shall also yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And every one who hath left brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, or houses, for the sake of my name, will receive many fold more, and will inherit everlasting life.

30. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.

## Matthew 20

1. For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.

2. And having agreed with the laborers for a denary a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market-place;

4. and said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is right, I will give you. And they went.

5. Again going out about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did likewise.

6. And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing, and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?

7. They say to him, Because no one hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard.

8. And when evening came, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their pay, beginning with the last, and going on to the first.

9. And they who were hired about the eleventh hour came, and received each a denary.

10. But when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more; and they too received each a denary.

11. And when they had received it, they murmured against the householder,

12. saying, These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.

13. But he answering said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a denary?

14. Take thy due, and go. But I will give to this last even as to thee.

15. Am I not free to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?

16. Thus the last will be first, and the first, last. And as

17. Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve apart, and on the way said to them,

18. Lo! we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death,

19. and will deliver him up to the gentiles to mock, and scourge, and crucify; and on the third day he will rise again.

20. Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, falling down before him, and asking a certain thing of him.

21. And he said to her, What is thy wish? She saith to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.

22. But Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which I am to drink? They say to him, We can.

23. He saith to them, Ye will indeed drink my cup; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but it will be given to those for whom it hath been prepared by my Father.

24. And when the ten heard this, they were much displeased with the two brothers.

25. But Jesus called them to him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great men exercise a strict authority over them.

26. Not so shall it be among you; but whoever desireth to become great among you, will be your minister;

27. and whoever desireth to be first among you, will be your servant;

28. even as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.

29. And as they were going out of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.

30. And lo! two blind men, who were sitting by the way-side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have pity on us, Son of David!

31. And the multitude sharply bade them be silent. But they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have pity on us, Son of David!

32. And Jesus stopped, and called them, and said, What would ye have me do for you?

33. They say to him, Lord, to open our eyes.

34. Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and they immediately received sight, and followed him.

## Matthew 21

1. And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,

2. saying to them, Go m the village over against you, and immediately ye will find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose and bring them to me.

3. And if any one say aught to you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and he will immediately send them.

4. Now this took place, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,

5. "Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy king cometh to thee, meek, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of a beast of burden."

6. And the disciples o went, and did as Jesus bade them,

7. and brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their garments, and he sat on them.

8. And very many of the multitude spread their garments in the road; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the road.

9. And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, were crying out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heavens!

10. And when he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was in commotion, saying, Who is this?

11. And the multitudes said, This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.

12. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves;

13. and said to them, It is written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer; but ye make it a den of robbers."

14. And the blind and lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.

15. But the chief priests and the scribes, when they saw the wonderful things which he did, and the children that were crying out in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, were much displeased;

16. and said to him, Dost thou hear what these say? But Jesus saith to them, Yea; did ye never read, "From the mouth of babes and sucklings thou didst prepare praise"?

17. And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.

18. And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.

19. And seeing one fig-tree by the road-side, he went up to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only; and he saith to it, Let there be no fruit from thee hencefoward for ever. And immediately the fig-tree withered.

20. And the disciples seeing it, marveled, saying, How suddenly did the fig-tree wither!

21. Jesus answering said to them, Truly do I say to you, If ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only shall ye do what hath been done to the fig-tree, but should ye even say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it would be done.

22. And all things whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye will receive.

23. And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?

24. And Jesus answering said to them, I also will ask you one question; which if ye answer me, I too will tell you by what authority I do these things.

25. The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven, or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?

26. But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude; for all regard John as a prophet.

27. And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. And he said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

28. But what think ye? A man had two sons: he came to the first, and said, Son, go, work today in the vineyard.

29. And he answered and said, I will not. Afterward he repented, and went.

30. And he came to the other and said the same. And he answered and said, I will, sir; and went not.

31. Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith to them, Truly do I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

32. For John came to you as a preacher of righteousness, and ye did not believe him; but the publicans and the harlots believed him; and ye, when ye had seen it, did not afterward repent, that ye might believe him.

33. Hear another parable. There was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.

34. And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive his fruits.

35. And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

36. Again he sent other servants more than the first; and they dealt with them in the same manner.

37. And afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.

38. But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.

39. And they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

40. When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?

41. They say to him, He will bring those wicked men to a miserable end, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their season.

42. Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the Scriptures, "The stone which the builders rejected, the same hath become the corner-stone; from the Lord did this come, and it is marvelous in our eyes?"

43. Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.

44. And the chief priests and the Pharisees when they heard his parables, knew that he was speaking of them.

45. And they sought to seize him, but feared the multitudes, because they regarded him as a prophet.

## Matthew 22

1. Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, and said,

2. The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage-feast for his son,

3. and sent forth his servants to call to the feast those who had been invited; and they would not come.

4. Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come to the feast.

5. But they made light of it, and went away; one to his farm, another to his merchandise.

6. And the rest seized his servants, and ill-treated and slew them.

7. And the king was enraged; and sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.

8. Then saith he to his servants, The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.

9. Go therefore into the thoroughfares, and as many as ye find, invite to the feast.

10. So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good; and the bride-chamber was fully furnished with guests.

11. And the king, coming in to view the guests, saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment;

12. and he saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in here, not having a wedding garment? And he was struck dumb.

13. Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

14. For many are called, but few are chosen.

15. Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how l they might ensnare him in speech.

16. And they send out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and thou carest for no one; for thou regardest not the person of men.

17. Tell us, therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

18. But Jesus, perceiving their wickedness, said, Why are ye trying me, hypocrites?

19. Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denary.

20. And Jesus saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription?

21. They say, Caesar’s. Then saith he to them, Render then to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.

22. And hearing this, they wondered, and left him, and went away.

23. The same day there came to him Sadducees, saying that there is no resurrection; and they asked him,

24. saying, Teacher, Moses said, "If a man die having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother."

25. Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first married and died; and, having no offspring, left his wife to his brother.

26. And so also the second, and the third, even to the seventh.

27. And last of all the woman died.

28. In the resurrection, then, of which of the seven will she be the wife? For they all had her.

29. Jesus answered and said to them, Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

30. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

31. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,

32. "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"? He is not a God of the dead, but of the living.

33. And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

34. And the Pharisees, hearing that he had put the Sadducees to silence, assembled together;

35. and one of them, a lawyer, asked, trying him,

36. Teacher, which commandment is great in the Law?

37. And he said to him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind."

38. This is the great and first commandment.

39. There is a second like it: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

40. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.

41. And while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,

42. saying, What think ye concerning the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, David’s.

43. He saith to them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him lord? saying,

44. "The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I put thine enemies under thy feet."

45. If David then calleth him lord, how is he his son?

46. And no one was able to answer him a word; nor durst any one from that day question him any more.

## Matthew 23

1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes, and to his disciples,

2. saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses.

3. All, therefore, whatever they bid you, do and observe; but do not according to their works; for they say, and do not.

4. They bind heavy burdens, and lay them on men’s shoulders, and will not themselves move them with a finger.

5. And all their works they do to be observed by men. They make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge their fringes,

6. and love the first place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,

7. and salutations in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi.

8. But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your teacher; and ye are all brethren.

9. And call no one your father on the earth; for one is your father, he who is in heaven.

10. Nor be ye called leaders; for one is your leader, the Christ.

11. But the greatest among you will be your servant.

12. And whoever shall exalt himself will be humbled; and whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.

13. But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites I because ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye go not in yourselves, nor suffer those who are entering to go in.

14. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him two-fold mole a son of hell than yourselves.

15. Woe to you, blind guides, that say, Whoever sweareth by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever sweareth by the gold of the temple, is bound.

16. Fools and blind I for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?

17. And, Whoever sweareth by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, is bound.

18. Blind men! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar flint sanctifieth the gift?

19. He then who sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all that is upon it;

20. and he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him who dwelleth in it;

21. and he who sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him who sitteth thereon.

22. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of the mint, and the dill, and the cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, justice, and mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave those undone.

23. Blind guides! who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel.

24. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they are full of robbery and licentiousness.

25. Blind Pharisee! cleanse first the inside of the cup, that its outside side also may become clean.

26. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whited sepulchres, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.

27. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

28. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous,

29. and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

30. So that ye bear witness against yourselves, that ye are the sons of those who killed the prophets.

31. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers!

32. Serpents, brood of vipers! how can ye escape the punishment of hell?

33. Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;

34. that on you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye slew, between the temple and the altar.

35. Truly do I say to you, All these things will come upon this generation.

36. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

37. Lo! your house is left to you desolate.

38. For I say to you, Ye will not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

## Matthew 24

1. And Jesus went out, and was going from the temple; and his disciples came to him, to show him the buildings of the temple.

2. And he answering said to them, See ye not all these? Truly do I say to you, There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.

3. And as he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? and what will be the signs of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

4. And Jesus answering said to them, See that no one deceive you.

5. For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many.

6. And ye are to hear of wars, and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled; for these things must come to pass; but not yet is the end.

7. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in divers places.

8. But all these things are the beginning of travail-pains.

9. Then will they deliver you up to distress, and will kill you; and ye will be hated by all nations on account of my name.

10. And then will many fall away; and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.

11. And many false prophets will arise, and will deceive many.

12. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of the many will wax cold.

13. But he that endureth to the end will be saved.

14. And these glad tidings of the kingdom will be published throughout the whole world for a testimony to all the nations; and then will come the end.

15. When, therefore, ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let him that readeth understand,)

16. then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains;

17. let not him that is on the house-top go down to take away the things belonging to his house;

18. and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his garment.

19. And woe to the women with child, and to those with children at the breast, in those days!

20. And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor on a sabbath.

21. For there will then be great distress, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world to this time; no, nor shall ever be.

22. And were not those days to shortened, no flesh would be saved; but, for the sake of the chosen, these days will be shortened.

23. Then if any one say to you, Lo! here is the Christ; or there, believe him not.

24. For there will rise up false Christs, and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders, so that, if possible, even the chosen will be deceived.

25. Lo! I have told you beforehand.

26. If therefore they say to you, Lo! he is in the wilderness; go not forth; lo! he is in the private chambers; believe them not.

27. For as the lightning cometh from the east, and shineth even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of man.

28. Wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

29. And immediately after the distress of those days will the sun be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

30. And then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and will see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

31. And he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet, and they will gather his chosen from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

32. And from the fig-tree learn its parable. When its branch hath now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that summer is near.

33. So also, when ye see all these things, know ye that he is near, at the doors.

34. Truly do I say to you, This generation will not pass away, till all these things take place.

35. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

36. But that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.

37. But as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man.

38. For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark,

39. and knew not, until the flood came, and took them all away, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.

40. Then will two men be in the field; one will be taken, and one left.

41. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and one left.

42. Watch, therefore, for ye know not on what day your Lord is coming.

43. But be sure of this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.

44. Therefore be ye also ready; for at an hour when ye think not, the Son of man cometh.

45. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord placed over his household, to give them their food in due season?

46. Happy is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.

47. Truly do I say to you, that he will place him in charge of all his substance.

48. But if the bad servant say in his heart, My lord is tarrying long;

49. and begin to beat his fellow-servants, and eat and drink with the drunken,

50. the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for it, and at an hour when he is not aware;

51. and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

## Matthew 25

1. Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.

2. And five of them were foolish, and five wise.

3. For the foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them.

4. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

5. And as the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

6. But at midnight there was a cry, Lo! the bridegroom! go out to meet him.

7. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

8. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.

9. But the wise answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.

10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.

11. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, lord, open to us.

12. But he answering said, Truly do I say to you, I know you not,

13. Watch, therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.

14. For it will be as when a man going abroad called his own servants, and intrusted to them his property;

15. and to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his ability, and went abroad.

16. He that had received the five talents went immediately and traded with the same, and gained five talents more.

17. In like manner, he that had received the two gained two more.

18. But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.

19. And after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

20. And he that had received the five talents came and brought five talents more, saying, Lord, thou intrustedst to me five talents; see, I have gained five talents more.

21. His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant! thou hast been faithful over a little, I will place thee in charge of much; enter into the joy of thy lord.

22. He also that had received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou intrustedst to me two talents; see, I have gained two talents more.

23. His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant! thou hast been faithful over a little, I will place thee in charge of much; enter into the joy of thy lord.

24. Then he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee to be a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter seed;

25. and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth. See! thou hast thine own.

26. But his lord answered and said to him, Wicked and slothful servant! Didst thou know that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter seed?

27. Thou oughtest then to have put my money with the money-dealers, and on my coming I should have received mine own with interest.

28. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who hath the ten talents.

29. For to every one that hath will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath will be taken away.

30. And cast out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness; there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

31. And when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he sit on the throne of his glory,

32. and before him will be gathered all the nations; and he will separate men one from another, as a shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;

33. and he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on the left.

34. Then will the king say to those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

35. For I was hungry, and ye gave me food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;

36. naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me.

37. Then will the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

38. and when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?

39. or when did we see thee sick, or in prison, and come to thee?

40. And the king will answer and say to them, Truly do I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it to me.

41. Then will he say also to those on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the everlasting fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his angels.

42. For I was hungry, and ye gave me no food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;

43. I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

44. Then will they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?

45. Then will he answer them, saying, Truly do I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

46. And these will go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into everlasting life.

## Matthew 26

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, that he said to his disciples,

2. Ye know that after two days cometh the passover; and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.

3. Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the court of the palace of the high-priest, named Caiaphas;

4. and took counsel together that they might seize Jesus by craft, and put him to death.

5. But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.

6. Now when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. there came to him a woman having an alabaster bottle of very costly ointment, and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table.

8. But the disciples seeing it, were much displeased, saying, To what purpose is this waste?.

9. For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

10. And Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, Why do ye trouble the woman? For she hath done a good deed to me.

11. For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.

12. For she, in pouring this ointment on my body, hath done it to prepare me for burial.

13. Truly do I say to you, Wherever these glad tidings shall be published in the whole world, this too which she hath done will be told for a memorial of her.

14. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,

15. and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him up to you? And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.

16. And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up.

17. And on the first of the days of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?

18. And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.

19. And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and made ready the passover.

20. And when evening came, he took his place at table with the twelve disciples.

21. And as they were eating, he said, Truly do I say to you, that one of you will betray me.

22. And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began every one to say to him, Is it I, Lord?

23. And he answering said, He that hath dipped his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.

24. The Son of man indeed goeth away, as it hath been written concerning him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Well were it for that man if he had not been born.

25. Then Judas, his betrayer, answering said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him, It is.

26. And, as they were eating, Jesus took a loaf, and having blessed, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

27. And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

28. for this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many for remission of sins.

29. And I say to you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.

30. And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

31. Then Jesus saith to them, This night will all of you fall away from me; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."

32. But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. Peter answering said to him, Though all should fall away from thee, yet will I never fall away.

34. Jesus said to him, Truly do I say to thee, that this night, before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me.

35. Peter saith to him, Even if I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And so said all the disciples.

36. Then Jesus cometh with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit here, while I go yonder and pray.

37. And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to he sorrowful and full of anguish.

38. Then he saith to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.

39. And he came a little nearer, and fell on his face, praying and saying, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me! nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.

40. And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Is it so that ye could not watch with me one hour?

41. Watch, and pray that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

42. Again he went away a second time, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this [cup] cannot pass away from me, but I must drink it, thy will be done!

43. And coming again he found them sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.

44. And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, saying again the same words.

45. Then he cometh to the disciples, and saith to them, Sleep on, and take your rest! Lo! the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.

46. Rise, let us be going; lo! he is at hand that delivereth me up.

47. And while he was yet speaking, lo! Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48. And his betrayer had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, he is the man; seize him.

49. And immediately going up to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.

50. And Jesus said to him, Friend, for what hast thou come! Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.

51. And, lo! one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his ear.

52. Then Jesus saith to him, Put back thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword will perish by the sword.

53. Dost thou think that I cannot pray to my Father, and he will now give me more than twelve legions of angels?

54. But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?

55. In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Ye have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take me; I sat daily teaching in the temple, and ye did not lay hands on me.

56. But all this hath been done, that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

57. And they who seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high-priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

58. But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as to the court of the high-priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the officers to see the end.

59. And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

60. and they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at last came two,

61. and said, This man affirmed, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it within three days.

62. And the high-priest arose, and said to him, Dost thou make no answer to what these men testify against thee?

63. But Jesus was silent. And the high-priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.

64. Jesus saith to him, I am. Moreover I say to you, Henceforth ye will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.

65. Then the high-priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? See! ye have now heard the blasphemy.

66. What think ye? They answered and said, He should be punished with death.

67. Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and some smote him with the palms of their hands,

68. saying, Prophesy to us, O Messiah! who it was that struck thee.

69. Now Peter was sitting outside in the court. And a maid-servant came to him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.

70. But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.

71. And when he had gone out into the porch, another woman saw him, and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. And again he denied with an oath; I do not know the man.

73. And shortly after, they who were standing by came and said to Peter, Surely thou too art one of them; for thy speech betrayeth thee.

74. Then he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know the man. And immediately a cock crew.

75. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said, Before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. And when it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to put him to death.

2. And having bound him, they led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.

3. Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

4. saying, I sinned in betraying innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? See thou to it.

5. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and withdrew; and went away and hanged himself.

6. And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are the price of blood.

7. And they consulted together, and bought with them the potter’s field, for a burial-place for strangers.

8. Wherefore that field hath been called, The Field of Blood, unto this day.

9. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom they of the sons of Israel priced,

10. and gave them for the potter’s field; as the Lord commanded me."

11. And Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor questioned him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said, I am.

12. And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.

13. Then saith Pilate to him, Dost thou not hear what things they are testifying against thee?

14. And he made him no answer, not even to one word; so that the governor greatly wondered.

15. Now at the feast the governor was wont to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.

16. And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.

17. When therefore they were assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?

18. For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.

19. And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered much this day in a dream because of him.

20. But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and to destroy Jesus.

21. And the governor answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release to you? And they said, Barabbas.

22. Pilate saith to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.

23. And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

24. And when Pilate saw that it availed nothing, but that rather a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of this blood; see ye to it.

25. And all the people answering said, His blood be on us, and on our children.

26. Then he released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s palace, and gathered to him the whole band.

28. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

29. And having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews!

30. And they spit upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.

31. And after they had made sport of him, they took off the robe from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.

32. And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, whom they compelled to carry his cross.

33. And having come to a place called Golgotha, that is, Place of a Skull,

34. they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall; and when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.

35. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lots.

36. And sitting down, they watched him there.

37. And they set up over his head the charge against him in writing: "This is Jesus the king of the Jews."

38. Then are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left.

39. And they who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

40. and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it up in three days, save thyself, if thou art the Son of God, and come down from the cross.

41. So also the chief priests, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,

42. He saved others, cannot he save himself? He is the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.

43. He trusteth in God; let him now deliver him, if he desireth him; for he said, I am the Son of God.

44. The robbers also, who were crucified with him, reviled him in the same manner.

45. And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land, until the ninth hour.

46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

47. Some of those standing there, when they heard this, said, This man is calling for Elijah.

48. And one of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.

49. But the rest said, Hold! let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.

50. And Jesus, crying out again with a loud voice, yielded up his spirit.

51. And, lo! the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth, quaked, and the rocks were rent,

52. and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of holy men that slept, arose,

53. and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared to many.

54. And the centurion and they who with him were watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and what was taking place, were exceedingly afraid, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

55. And many women were there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, rendering services to him;

56. among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

57. And at evening there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who was himself also a disciple of Jesus.

58. This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given him.

59. And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

60. and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, went away.

61. And Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.

62. And on the next day, that following the day of the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,

63. saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I rise.

64. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people, He hath risen from the dead; and the last error will be worse than the first.

65. Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard; go, make it as secure as ye know how.

66. And they went, and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone, and setting the guard.

## Matthew 28

1. And the sabbath being over, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to view the sepulchre.

2. And, lo! there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.

3. His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.

4. And for fear of him the keepers shook, and became as dead men.

5. And the angel answering said to the women, Fear ye not; for I know that ye are seeking Jesus, who was crucified.

6. He is not here; for he hath risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.

7. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he hath risen from the dead, and, lo! he is going before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him. Lo! I have told you.

8. And they went away quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

9. And lo! Jesus met them, saying, All hail! And they went up, and laid hold of his feet, and knelt down before him.

10. Then Jesus saith to them, Be not afraid; go, tell my brethren to depart into Galilee, and there they shall see me.

11. And as they were going, lo! some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all that had taken place.

12. And having assembled with the elders, and taken counsel together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,

13. saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away, while we slept.

14. And should the governor hear of this, we will persuade him, and make you secure.

15. So they took the money, and did as they were taught. And this story hath been commonly reported among the Jews to this day.

16. And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, into the mountain, where Jesus had directed them.

17. And when they saw him, they knelt down before him; but some doubted.

18. And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, All power was given to me in heaven and on earth.

19. Go, and make all nations my disciples, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;

20. teaching them to observe all things, whatever I have commanded you. And, lo! I am with you always, unto the end of the world.
