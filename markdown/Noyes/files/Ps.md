## Psalms 1

1. BOOK I  Happy the man who walketh not in the counsel of the unrighteous, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers;

2. But whose delight is in the law of the LORD, And who meditateth on his precepts day and night.

3. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaves also do not wither: All that he doeth shall prosper.

4. Not so the unrighteous; They are like chaff, which the wind driveth away.

5. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the just.

6. For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked leadeth to ruin.

## Psalms 2

1. Why do the heathen rage, And the nations meditate a vain thing?

2. Why do the kings of the earth rise up, And the princes combine together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed king?

3. "Let us break their bonds asunder; Let us cast away from us their fetters!"

4. He that sitteth in heaven will laugh; The Lord will have them in derision.

5. Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, And confound them in his hot displeasure.

6. "I myself have anointed my king, Upon Zion, my holy hill!"

7. I will declare the decree of Jehovah: He hath said to me, "Thou art my son; This day I have begotten thee.

8. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the ends of the earth for thy possession.

9. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel."

10. Be wise, therefore, O ye kings! Be admonished, ye rulers of the earth!

11. Be subject to Jehovah with awe, And fear with trembling!

12. Kiss the son, lest He be angry, and ye perish in your way; For soon shall his wrath be kindled. Happy are all they who seek refuge in him.

## Psalms 3

1. A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.  How many, O LORD, are mine enemies! How many are they who rise up against me!

2. How many are they who say of me, "There is no help for him with God"! [Pause.]

3. But thou, O LORD! art my shield, My glory, and the lifter-up of my head.

4. I call upon the LORD with my voice, And he heareth me from his holy hill. [Pause.]

5. I lay me down and sleep; I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me.

6. I will not fear the ten thousands of people Who on every side set themselves against me.

7. Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For thou smitest the cheek of all my enemies; Thou breakest the teeth of the wicked.

8. Deliverance cometh from the LORD: May thy blessing be with thy people! [Pause.]

## Psalms 4

1. For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.  Hear me, when I call, O God of my righteousness! Thou hast helped me, when I was in trouble,—Have pity upon me, and hear my prayer!

2. How long, O men! will ye dishonor my dignity? How long will ye love vanity, and seek disappointment? [Pause.]

3. Know ye that the LORD hath exalted one that is devoted to him; The LORD will hear, when I call upon him.

4. Stand in awe, and sin no more; Commune with your hearts upon your beds, and desist! [Pause.]

5. Offer sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in the LORD!

6. There are many who say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us!

7. Thou puttest gladness into my heart, Greater than theirs, when their corn and wine are abundant.

8. I will lay me down in peace, and sleep: For thou alone, O LORD! makest me dwell in safety.

## Psalms 5

1. For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with wind instruments. A psalm of David.  Give ear to my words, O LORD; Have regard to my cry!

2. Listen to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God! For to thee do I address my prayer.

3. In the morning shalt thou hear my voice, O LORD! In the morning will I address my prayer to thee, and look for help.

4. For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; The unrighteous man dwelleth not with thee.

5. The haughty shall not stand in thy sight; Thou hatest all that do iniquity.

6. Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; The man of blood and deceit the LORD abhorreth.

7. But I, through thy great goodness, will come to thy house; In thy fear will I worship at thy holy temple.

8. Lead me, O LORD! in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; Make thy path straight before my face!

9. For in their mouth there is no truth; Their heart is malignity; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.

10. Requite them, O God! Let them be confounded in their devices; Cast them out for the multitude of their transgressions; For against thee have they rebelled!

11. But let all, that put their trust in thee, rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them; Let them, that love thy name, be joyful in thee!

12. For thou, O LORD! dost bless the righteous; With favor dost thou encompass him, as with a shield.

## Psalms 6

1. For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with stringed instruments; to the octave. A psalm of David.  O LORD! rebuke me not in thine anger; Chasten me not in thy hot displeasure!

2. Have pity upon me, O LORD! for I am weak; Heal me, O LORD! for my bones tremble!

3. My soul, also, is sore troubled; And thou, O LORD! how long—?

4. Return, O LORD! and deliver me; Oh, save me according to thy mercy!

5. For in death no praise is given to thee; In the underworld who can give thee thanks?

6. I am weary with my groaning; All the night I make my bed to swim, And drench my couch with my tears.

7. Mine eye is wasted with grief; It hath become old because of all my enemies.

8. Depart from me, all ye that do iniquity; For the LORD heareth the voice of my weeping.

9. The LORD heareth my supplication; The LORD accepteth my prayer.

10. All my enemies shall be ashamed and utterly confounded; They shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.

## Psalms 7

1. A psalm of David, which he sang to Jehovah, on account of the reproaches of Cush the Benjamite.  O Jehovah, my God! to thee do I look for help; Save me from them that persecute me, and deliver me!

2. Lest mine enemy tear me like a lion; Lest he rend me in pieces, while there is none to help.

3. O Jehovah, my God! if I have done this,—If there be iniquity upon my hands,

4. If I have rendered evil to my friend, Or have despoiled him that without cause is mine enemy,—

5. Let my adversary pursue and take me; Let him trample me to the ground, And lay me prostrate in the dust! [Pause.]

6. Arise, O LORD! in thine anger; Lift thyself up against the rage of mine enemies; Awake for me, ordain judgment!

7. Let the assembly of the nations compass thee about, And on their account return to the height!

8. The LORD judgeth the nations; Judge me, O LORD! according to my righteousness, And requite me according to my integrity!

9. Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked be at an end; But establish the righteous! For the righteous God trieth the heart and the reins.

10. My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.

11. God is a righteous judge, And a God who is angry every day.

12. If he do not desist, He sharpeneth his sword; He bendeth his bow, and maketh it ready;

13. He prepareth for him the instruments of death; He shooteth his burning arrows.

14. Behold, he travailed with iniquity, And conceived mischief, But hath brought forth disappointment!

15. He made a pit and digged it. And is fallen into the ditch which he made.

16. His mischief returneth upon his own head, And his violence cometh down upon his own skull.

17. I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness; I will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

## Psalms 8

1. For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with the gittith. A psalm of David.  O Jehovah, our Lord! How excellent is thy name in all the earth! Thou hast set thy glory above the heavens.

2. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained praise, To put thine adversaries to shame, And to silence the enemy and avenger.

3. When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars which thou hast ordained:

4. What is man, that thou art mindful of him, And the son of man, that thou carest for him?

5. Yet thou hast made him little lower than God; Thou hast crowned him with glory and honor.

6. Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet,—

7. All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the forest;

8. The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, And whatever passeth through the paths of the deep.

9. O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!

## Psalms 9

1. For the leader of the music; to be sung in the manner or with the voice of maidens. To the Benites, or to Ben. A psalm of David.  I will praise thee, O LORD! with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.

2. I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High!

3. All my enemies are turned back; They fall and perish at thy presence.

4. For thou dost defend my right and my cause; Thou sittest upon the throne, a righteous judge.

5. Thou rebukest the nations; Thou destroyest the wicked; Thou blottest out their name for evermore!

6. The enemy is fallen,—a desolation for ever! Thou, O LORD! hast destroyed their cities; Their memory itself hath perished!

7. The LORD reigneth for ever; He hath prepared his throne for judgment.

8. He judgeth the world in righteousness; He administereth judgment to the nations with uprightness.

9. Yea, the LORD is a refuge for the oppressed; A refuge in times of trouble.

10. They who know thy name put their trust in thee; For thou, O LORD! forsakest not them that seek thee!

11. Sing praises to the LORD, who reigneth in Zion; Declare his doings among the people!

12. As the avenger of blood, he remembereth the distressed; He forgetteth not their complaint.

13. "Have pity upon me, [said I,] O LORD! Look upon my affliction through them that hate me; Lift me up from the gates of death:

14. That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion; That I may rejoice in salvation by thee."

15. The nations have sunk into the pit which they made; In the net, which they hid, is their own foot taken.

16. Thus it is known that the LORD executeth judgment; The wicked are ensnared in the work of their own hands. [Stringed instruments. Pause.]

17. The wicked shall be driven into the underworld; Yea, all the nations that forger God.

18. For the poor shall not always be forgotten; The hopes of the afflicted shall not perish for ever.

19. Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; Let the nations be judged by thee!

20. Strike terror into them, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! [Pause.]

## Psalms 10

1. Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?

2. Through the haughtiness of the wicked the poor are in distress; They are caught in the wiles which are contrived for them.

3. The wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire; The rapacious renounceth and contemneth Jehovah.

4. The wicked [saith] in his haughtiness, "He careth not!" All his thoughts are, "There is no God."

5. His course is always prosperous; Far in the heights are thy judgments from him; As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

6. He saith in his heart, "I shall never fall; I shall never be in adversity."

7. His mouth is full of perjury, deceit, and oppression; Mischief and injustice are upon his tongue.

8. He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are secretly fixed upon the poor.

9. He secretly lieth in wait, like a lion in a thicket; He lieth in wait to seize upon the helpless; He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.

10. He croucheth, and lowereth himself, And the wretched fall into his paws.

11. He saith in his heart, "God doth forget; He hideth his face; he doth never see it."

12. Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up thine hand: Forget not the distressed!

13. Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, "He careth not for it"?

14. Thou dost see it; yea, thou beholdest malice and oppression, And markest it upon thy hand! The poor committeth himself to thee; Thou art the helper of the fatherless.

15. Break thou the arm of the unjust and wicked man; Seek out his wickedness, till thou canst find none!

16. Jehovah is king for ever and ever; The gentiles shall perish out of his land.

17. Thou, O LORD! wilt hear the desires of the distressed; Thou wilt strengthen their hearts; Thou wilt lend a listening ear!

18. Thou wilt maintain the cause of the fatherless and the oppressed, That henceforth none may be driven from the land.

## Psalms 11

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  In the LORD do I put my trust. Why say ye to me, "Flee, like a bird, to your mountain?

2. For, lo! the wicked bend their bow; They make ready their arrows on the string, To shoot in secret at the upright in heart.

3. If the pillars be broken down, What can the righteous do?"

4. The LORD is in his holy palace; The LORD’S throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids prove the children of men.

5. The LORD trieth the righteous; But the wicked, and the lover of violence, his soul hateth.

6. Upon the wicked he will rain lightning; Fire and brimstone and a burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.

7. For the LORD is righteous; he loveth righteousness; The upright shall see his face.

## Psalms 12

1. For the leader of the music; to the octave. A psalm of David.  Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; The faithful are failing among men.

2. They speak falsehood one to another; With flattering lips, with a double heart, do they speak.

3. May the LORD destroy all flattering lips, And the tongue which speaketh proud things!

4. Who say, "With our tongues will we prevail; Our lips are our reliance; Who is lord over us?"

5. For the oppression of the poor and the sighing of the wretched, Now will I stand up, saith the LORD; I will set in safety him whom they puff at.

6. The words of the LORD are pure; Like silver purified in a furnace on the earth, Seven times refined.

7. Thou, O LORD! will watch over them; Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.

8. The wicked walk on every side, When the vilest of men are exalted.

## Psalms 13

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  How long, O LORD! wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

2. How long shall I have anxiety in my soul for ever, And sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?

3. Look down and hear me, O LORD, my God! Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;

4. Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him!" Lest my adversaries rejoice, when I am fallen.

5. Yet will I trust in thy goodness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation;

6. I will sing to the LORD, that he hath dealt kindly with me.

## Psalms 14

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  The fool saith in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt; abominable are their doings; There is none that doeth good.

2. Jehovah looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any that have understanding, That have regard to God.

3. They are all gone out of the way; together are they corrupt; There is none that doeth good—no, not one.

4. Shall not the evil-doers be requited, Who devour my people like bread, And call not upon Jehovah?

5. Yea, then shall they be in great fear; For Jehovah is with the race of the righteous.

6. Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor; But Jehovah is their refuge.

7. Oh that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captives of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel be glad.

## Psalms 15

1. A psalm of David.  LORD, who shall abide at thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon thy holy hill?

2. He that walketh uprightly, and doeth righteousness, And speaketh the truth from his heart;

3. He that slandereth not with his tongue, That doeth no injury to his neighbor, And uttereth no reproach against his neighbor;

4. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; But who honoreth them that fear the LORD; Who sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;

5. He that lendeth not his money for interest, And taketh not a bribe against the innocent: He that doeth these things shall never be moved.

## Psalms 16

1. A psalm off David.  Preserve me, O God! for to thee do I look for help.

2. I have said to Jehovah, Thou art my Lord; I have no happiness beyond thee!

3. The holy that are in the land, and the excellent,—in them is all my delight.

4. They who hasten after other gods shall have multiplied sorrows; Their drink-offerings of blood I will not offer, Nor will I take their names upon my lips.

5. Jehovah is my portion and my cup; Thou wilt maintain my lot!

6. My portion hath fallen to me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly inheritance.

7. I will bless the LORD, who careth for me; Yea, in the night my heart admonisheth me.

8. I set the LORD before me at all times; Since he is at my right hand, I shall not fall.

9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my spirit rejoiceth; Yea, my flesh dwelleth in security.

10. For thou wilt not give me up to the underworld; Nor wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see the pit.

11. Thou wilt show me the path of life; In thy presence is fulness of joy; At thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.

## Psalms 17

1. A psalm of David.  Hear the righteous cause, O LORD! Attend to my cry; Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit!

2. May my sentence come forth from thy presence; May thine eyes behold uprightness!

3. Provest thou my heart, visitest thou me in the night, Triest thou me like gold, thou shalt find nothing!

4. My thoughts do not vary from my lips. As to the deeds of men, Through the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

5. Support my steps in thy paths, That my feet may not slip!

6. I call upon thee, O God! for thou wilt hear me; Incline thine ear to me, and listen to my prayer!

7. Show forth thy loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand Them that seek refuge in thee from their adversaries!

8. Guard me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings

9. From the wicked who assault me, From my deadly enemies who compass me about!

10. They shut up their hard heart; With their mouth they speak haughtily.

11. They encompass us in all our steps; They fix their eyes upon us, that they may cast us on the ground.

12. They are like a lion, eager for his prey; Like a young lion, lurking in secret places.

13. Arise, O LORD! disappoint them, cast them down! Deliver me from the wicked by thy sword,

14. From men, by thy hand, O LORD! from men of the world, Whose portion is in life; whom thou loadest with thy treasure; Whose children have enough, and leave their superfluity to their children.

15. But I through righteousness shall see thy face; I shall be satisfied with the revival of thy countenance.

## Psalms 18

1. I love thee, O LORD, my strength!

2. Jehovah is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I trust; My shield, my strong defence, and my high tower.

3. I called upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And was delivered from my enemies.

4. The snares of death encompassed me; The floods of destruction filled me with dismay;

5. The snares of the underworld surrounded me, And the nets of death seized upon me.

6. In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried unto my God; He heard my voice from his palace, And my cry came before him into his ears.

7. Then the earth quaked and trembled; The foundations of the mountains rocked and were shaken, Because his wrath was kindled.

8. A smoke went up from his nostrils, And fire from his mouth devoured; Burning coals shot forth from him.

9. He bowed the heavens, and came down; And darkness was under his feet;

10. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

11. And he made darkness his covering; His pavilion round about him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

12. At the brightness before him, his thick clouds passed away; Then came hailstones and coals of fire.

13. The LORD also thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice, Amid hailstones and coals of fire.

14. He sent forth his arrows, and scattered them; Continual lightnings, and discomfited them.

15. Then the channels of the deep were seen, And the foundations of the earth were laid bare At thy rebuke, O LORD! At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

16. He stretched forth his hand from above; he took me, And drew me out of deep waters.

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy; From my adversaries, who were too powerful for me.

18. They fell upon me in the day of my calamity; But the LORD was my stay.

19. He brought me forth into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.

20. The LORD hath rewarded me according to my righteous; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

21. For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God.

22. For all his laws were in my sight; I did not put away his statutes from me.

23. I was upright before him, And kept myself from iniquity.

24. Therefore hath the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.

25. To the merciful thou showest thyself merciful; To the upright thou showest thyself upright;

26. To the pure thou showest thyself pure, And to the perverse thou showest thyself perverse.

27. For thou savest the afflicted people, But the haughty countenance thou bringest down.

28. Thou causest my lamp to shine; Jehovah, my God, enlighteneth my darkness.

29. For through thee I have broken through troops; Through my God I have leaped over walls.

30. The ways of God are just and true; His word is pure, tried in the fire; He is a shield to all who put their trust in him.

31. Who, then, is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?

32. It is God that girded me with strength, And made my way plain.

33. He made my feet like the hind’s, And set me in my high places;

34. He taught my hands to war, So that my arm bent the bow of brass.

35. Thou gavest me the shield of thy protection; Thy right hand held me up, And thy goodness made me great.

36. Thou didst make a wide path for my steps, So that my feet did not stumble.

37. I pursued my enemies and overtook them, And turned not back till I had destroyed them.

38. I smote them, so that they could not rise; They fell under my feet.

39. Thou didst gird me with strength for the battle; Thou didst cast down my adversaries under me.

40. Thou didst cause my enemies to turn their backs, So that I destroyed them that hated me.

41. They cried, but there was none to help; To Jehovah, but he answered them not.

42. I beat them small, like dust before the wind; I cast them out as the dirt of the streets.

43. Thou hast delivered me from the assaults of the nations; Thou hast made me the head of the kingdoms. Nations whom I knew not serve me;

44. They who have only heard of me obey me; Yea, men of a strange land submit themselves to me;

45. Men of a strange land fade away, like a leaf, And come trembling from their strongholds.

46. Jehovah is the living God; blessed be my rock; Exalted be the God of my salvation!

47. It is God who hath given me vengeance, And subdued the nations under me;

48. He delivered me from my enemies; Yea, thou hast lifted me up above my adversaries; Thou hast saved me from the violent man!

49. Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD! among the nations, And sing praises to thy name.

50. Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth mercy to his anointed,—To David and to his posterity for ever.

## Psalms 19

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  The heavens declare the glory of God; The firmament showeth forth the work of his hands.

2. Day uttereth instruction unto day, And night showeth knowledge unto night.

3. They have no speech nor language, And their voice is not heard;

4. Yet their sound goeth forth to all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

5. Which cometh forth like a bridegroom from his chamber, And rejoiceth, like a strong man, to run his course.

6. He goeth forth from the extremity of heaven, And maketh his circuit to the end of it; And nothing is hid from his heat.

7. The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; The precepts of the LORD are sure, making wise the simple;

8. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandments of the LORD are pure, enlightening the eyes;

9. The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

10. More precious are they than gold; yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.

11. By them also is thy servant warned, And in keeping of them there is great reward.

12. Who knoweth his own offences? Oh, cleanse thou me from secret faults!

13. Keep back also thy servant from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me! Then shall I be upright; I shall not be polluted with gross transgression.

14. May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer!

## Psalms 20

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  May Jehovah hear thee in the day of trouble; May the name of the God of Jacob defend thee!

2. May he send thee help from his sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion!

3. May he have regard to all thine offerings, And accept thy burnt sacrifice! [Pause.]

4. May he grant thee thy heart’s desire, And fulfill all thy purposes!

5. We will rejoice in thy protection, And in the name of our God will we set up our banners, When Jehovah hath fulfilled all thy petitions.

6. Now I know that Jehovah helpeth his anointed; That he heareth him from his holy heaven, And aideth him with the saving strength of his right hand.

7. Some glory in chariots, and some in horses, But we in the name of Jehovah our God.

8. They stumble and fall, But we stand and are erect.

9. The LORD save the king! May he hear us when we call!

## Psalms 21

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  The king rejoiceth in thy strength, O LORD! Yea, he doth greatly exult in thy protection.

2. Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, And hast not denied him the request of his lips. [Pause.]

3. Yea, thou hast met him with rich blessings, Thou hast placed a crown of pure gold upon his head.

4. He asked life of thee; thou gavest it him; Even long life, enduring for ever.

5. Great is his glory through thine aid; Honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.

6. Thou hast made him blessed for evermore; Thou hast made him glad with the joy of thy countenance.

7. For the king trusteth in the LORD; And through the goodness of the Most High he shall never fall.

8. Thy hand shall overtake all thine enemies; Thy right hand shall overtake them that hate thee.

9. Thou wilt make them like a burning oven in the time of thine anger; Jehovah shall swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them.

10. Their offspring shalt thou destroy from the earth, And their posterity from the sons of men.

11. For they spread a net of mischief against thee; They devised plots against thee, but they did not prevail.

12. Therefore thou wilt cause them to turn their backs; Thou wilt make ready thine arrows upon the strings against them.

13. Exalt thyself, O LORD! by thy strength! So will we sing, and praise thy mighty deeds.

## Psalms 22

1. For the leader of the music. To the tune of "The hind of the morning." A psalm of David.  My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me? Why so far from mine aid, and from the words of my cry?

2. O my God! I cry during the day, but thou hearest not; In the night also, but I have no rest.

3. And yet thou art holy, Dwelling amid the praises of Israel!

4. Our fathers trusted in thee; They trusted, and thou didst save them.

5. They called upon thee, and were delivered; They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.

6. But I am a worm, and not a man; The reproach of men, and the scorn of the people.

7. All who see me scoff at me; They open wide the lips; they shake the head.

8. "He trusted in the LORD, let him help him; Let him deliver him, since he delighted in him!"

9. Surely thou art he that didst bring me into the world; Thou didst make me lie secure upon my mother’s breast!

10. Upon thee have I cast myself from my birth; Thou hast been my God from my earliest breath!

11. Oh, be not far from me, for trouble is near; For there is none to help!

12. Many bulls surround me; Strong bulls of Bashan close me in on every side.

13. They open their mouths wide against me, Like a ravening and roaring lion.

14. I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint; My heart is become like wax; It melteth in my bosom.

15. My strength is dried up like an earthen vessel, And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; Thou hast brought me to the dust of death!

16. For dogs have surrounded me; Bands of evil-doers have encompassed me,—Like lions my hands and my feet.

17. I can count all my bones; They gaze, and feast their eyes upon me.

18. They divide my garments among them, And for my vesture they cast lots.

19. But be not thou far from me, O LORD! O my strength! make haste to mine aid!

20. Deliver my life from the sword; My blood from the power of the dog;

21. Save me from the lion’s mouth; Shield me from the horns of the buffaloes!

22. I will proclaim thy name to my brethren; In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

23. Praise him, ye worshippers of Jehovah! Extol him, all ye race of Jacob. And fear him, all ye race of Israel!

24. For he hath not despised nor abhorred the misery of the afflicted. Nor hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard.

25. My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before them that fear him!

26. The afflicted shall eat, and be satisfied; They that seek the LORD shall praise him; Your hearts shall be glad for ever and ever!

27. All the ends of the earth shall remember, and turn to Jehovah; All the families of the nations shall worship before thee!

28. For the kingdom is Jehovah’s; He is the governor of the nations.

29. All the rich of the earth shall eat and worship; Before him shall they also bow, who are going down to the dust, Who cannot keep themselves alive.

30. The future generation shall serve him; The race which is to come shall hear of Jehovah.

31. They shall come, and declare his righteousness; His mighty deeds to the people that shall be born.

## Psalms 23

1. A psalm of David.  The LORD is my shepherd: I shall not want.

2. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters.

3. He reviveth my soul; He leadeth me in paths of safety, For his name’s sake.

4. When I walk through a valley of deathlike shade, I fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy crook and thy staff, they comfort me.

5. Thou preparest a table before me In the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil; My cup runneth over.

6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

## Psalms 24

1. A psalm of David.  The earth is the LORD’S, and all that is therein; The world, and they who inhabit it.

4. He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; Who hath not inclined his soul to falsehood, Nor sworn deceitfully.

5. He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, And favor from the God of his salvation.

6. This is the race of them that seek him; They that seek thy face are Jacob. [Pause.]

7. Lift up your heads, O ye gates! Lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, That the king of glory may come in!

8. "Who is this king of glory?" Jehovah, strong and mighty; Jehovah, mighty in battle.

9. Lift up your heads, O ye gates! Lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, That the king of glory may enter in!

10. "Who is this king of glory?" Jehovah, God of hosts, he is the king of glory. [Pause.]

2. O my God! I trust in thee; let me not be put to shame! Let not my enemies triumph over me!

3. Yea, none that hope in thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame who wickedly forsake thee.

4. Cause me to know thy ways, O LORD! Teach me thy paths!

5. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me! For thou art the God from whom cometh my help; In thee do I trust at all times!

6. Remember thy loving-kindness, O LORD! and thy tender mercy, Which thou hast exercised of old!

7. Remember not the faults and transgressions of my youth! According to thy mercy remember thou me, For thy goodness’ sake, O LORD!

8. Good and righteous is the LORD; Therefore showeth he to sinners the way.

9. The humble he guideth in his statutes, And the humble he teacheth his way.

10. All the doings of the LORD are mercy and truth To those who keep his covenant and his precepts.

11. For thy name’s sake, O LORD, Pardon my iniquity; for it is great!

12. Who is the man that feareth the LORD? Him doth he show the way which he should choose.

13. He shall himself dwell in prosperity, And his offspring shall inherit the land.

14. The friendship of the LORD is with them that fear him, And he will teach them his covenant.

15. Mine eyes are ever directed to the LORD, For he will pluck my feet from the net.

16. Look upon me, and pity me; For I am desolate and afflicted!

17. Lighten the sorrows of my heart, And deliver me from my troubles!

18. Look upon my affliction and distress, And forgive all my sins!

19. Consider how many are my enemies, And with what violence they hate me!

20. Guard thou my life, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I have trusted in thee!

2. Examine me, O LORD! and prove me; Try my reins and my heart!

3. For thy kindness is ever before my eyes, And I walk in thy truth.

4. I sit not with men of falsehood. And go not in company with dissemblers.

5. I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And do not sit with the wicked.

6. I wash my hands in innocence. And go around thine altar. O LORD!

7. To utter the voice of thanksgiving, And tell of all thy wondrous works.

8. O LORD! I love the habitation of thy house, The place where thine honor dwelleth!

9. Gather not my breath with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood,

10. In whose hands is mischief, And whose right hands are full of bribes!

11. But as for me, I walk in my integrity; Oh, redeem me, and be merciful to me!

12. My feet tread in a straight path; In the congregation will I bless the LORD.

## Psalms 27

1. A psalm of David.  The LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the shield of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?

2. When the wicked came upon me to devour me, Even my persecutors and enemies, they stumbled and fell.

3. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; Though war should rise against me, yet will I be confident.

4. One thing have I desired of the LORD; that do I yet seek; That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the grace of the LORD, And to gaze upon his temple.

5. For in the day of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion; Yea, in the secret place of his tabernacle will he shelter me; He will set me upon a rock.

6. Yea, already doth he lift my head above my enemies, who are around me; Therefore in his tabernacle will I offer sacrifices with the sound of trumpets; I will sing, yea, with instruments of music I will give praise to the LORD.

7. Hear my voice, O LORD! when I cry unto thee; Have pity upon me, and answer me!

8. When I think of thy precept, "Seek ye my face!" Thy face, LORD, do I seek.

9. O hide not thou thy face from me; Cast not thy servant away in displeasure! Thou hast been my help, do not leave me; Do not forsake me, O God, my helper!

10. For my father and my mother have forsaken me; But the LORD will take me up.

11. Teach me thy way, O LORD! And lead me in the right path, because of my enemies!

12. Give me not up to the will of my adversaries! For false witnesses have risen up against me, And such as breathe out injustice.

14. Be of good courage; let thy heart be strong; Hope thou in the LORD!

## Psalms 28

1. A psalm of David.  To thee do I cry, O LORD! O my rock! be not silent to me, Lest, if thou answer me not, I become like those who go down to the pit!

2. Hear the voice of my supplication, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands to thy most holy sanctuary!

3. Draw me not away with the impious, and with evil-doers, Who speak peace to their neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts!

4. Give them according to their deeds, and the wickedness of their doings; Give them according to the work of their hands; Render to them their desert!

5. For they regard not the doings of the LORD, nor the work of his hands; Therefore will he destroy them, and not again build them up.

6. Praised be the LORD, for he hath heard the voice of my supplications!

7. The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusteth in him, and he helpeth me; Therefore doth my heart exult, And in my song I will praise him.

8. Jehovah is the strength of his people; He is the protecting shield of his anointed.

9. Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; Feed them also, and build them up for ever!

## Psalms 29

1. A psalm of David.  Give to Jehovah, O ye sons of God! Give to Jehovah glory and praise!

6. Yea, he maketh them to leap like a calf,—Lebanon and Sirion like a young buffalo.

7. The voice of Jehovah divideth the flames of fire.

8. The voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness tremble; Yea, Jehovah maketh the wilderness of Kadesh tremble.

9. The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds bring forth, And layeth bare the forests; While, in his palace, every one declareth his glory.

10. Jehovah sitteth above the flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth king for ever.

11. Jehovah will give strength to his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

## Psalms 30

1. A psalm of David. To the air of songs for the dedication of a house.  I will extol thee, O LORD! for thou hast lifted me up, And hast not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me.

2. O Jehovah, my God! I called upon thee, and thou hast healed me!

3. O LORD! thou hast raised me up from the underworld; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

4. Sing unto the LORD, O ye his servants! And praise his holy name!

5. For his anger endureth but a moment, But his favor through life; In the evening sorrow may be a guest, But joy cometh in the morning.

6. I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved!"

7. Thou, O LORD! by thy favor, hast made my mountain to stand strong; Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled!

8. I cried unto thee, O LORD! To the LORD I made supplication:

9. "What will my blood profit thee, that I should go down to the pit? Can dust praise thee? Can it declare thy faithfulness?

10. Hear, O LORD! and have pity upon me! Be thou, LORD! my helper!"

11. Thou didst turn my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness.

12. Therefore I will sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah, my God! I will give thanks to thee for ever!

## Psalms 31

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  In thee, O LORD! do I trust; let me never be put to shame; According to thy goodness deliver me!

2. Bow down thine ear to me; help me speedily! Be to me a strong rock, a high fortress, for my deliverance!

3. For thou art my rock and my high fortress; Be thou also my guide, and lead me, for thy name’s sake!

4. Draw me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me, For thou art my strength!

5. Into thy hand I commit my life; Thou wilt deliver me, O LORD, thou God of truth!

6. I hate those who regard lying vanities, And put my trust in the LORD.

7. I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy, That thou hast looked upon my trouble, And hast had regard to my distress;

8. That thou hast not given me up to the hands of my enemies, But hast set my feet in a wide place.

9. Have mercy upon me, O LORD! for I am in trouble! My face is consumed with grief; Yea, my spirit and my body.

10. For my life is wasted with sorrow, And my years with sighing; My strength faileth by reason of my affliction, And my bones are consumed on account of all my enemies.

11. I have become the scorn of my neighbors, And the terror of my acquaintance; They who see me abroad flee from me.

12. I am forgotten like a dead man out of mind; I am like a broken vessel.

13. I hear the slander of many; fear is on every side; For they take counsel together against me; They devise to take away my life.

14. But I trust in thee, O Jehovah! I say, "Thou art my God!"

15. My destiny is in thy hand; Deliver me from the power of my enemies and persecutors!

16. Let thy face shine upon thy servant, And save me through thy mercy!

17. Let me not be put to shame, O LORD! for I have called upon thee; Let the wicked be put to shame; Let them be silenced in the grave!

18. Let lying lips be put to silence, Which speak proud things against the righteous, With haughtiness and contempt!

19. O how great is thy goodness, which thou treasurest up for them that fear thee; Which thou showest to them that trust in thee, before the sons of men!

20. Thou hidest them in the secret place of thy presence from the machinations of men; Thou shelterest them in thy pavilion from the violence of tongues.

21. Praised be the LORD; for he hath shown me his wonderful kindness, As in a fortified city!

22. I said in my distress, "I am cut off from before thine eyes;" But thou didst hear the voice of my supplication, When I cried unto thee.

23. O love the LORD, all ye his servants; For the LORD preserveth the faithful, And requiteth the proud in full measure!

24. Be of good courage; let your hearts be strong, All ye who trust in the LORD!

## Psalms 32

1. A psalm of David.  Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned!

2. Happy the man to whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile!

3. While I kept silence, my bones were wasted, By reason of my groaning all the day long.

4. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; My moisture dried up, as in summer’s drought.

5. At length I acknowledged to thee my sin, And did not hide my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgression to the LORD;" And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin! [Pause.]

6. Therefore shall every pious man pray to thee, while thou mayst be found; Surely the floods of great waters shall not come near him.

7. Thou art my hiding-place; thou preservest me from trouble; Thou compassest me about with songs of deliverance. [Pause.]

8. I will instruct thee, and show thee the way thou shouldst go; I will give thee counsel, and keep mine eye upon thee.

9. Be ye not like the horse and the mule, which have no understanding, Whose mouths must be pressed with the bridle and curb, Because they will not come near thee!

10. The wicked hath many sorrows; But he that trusteth in the LORD is encompassed with mercies.

11. Rejoice in the LORD, and be glad, ye righteous; Shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart!

## Psalms 33

1. Rejoice, O ye righteous, in the LORD! For praise becometh the upright.

2. Praise the LORD with the harp; Sing to him with the ten-stringed psaltery!

3. Sing to him a new song; Play skilfully amid the sound of trumpets!

4. For the word of the LORD is right, And all his acts are faithful.

5. He loveth justice and equity; The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.

6. By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, And all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth.

7. He gathereth the waters of the sea, as a heap; He layeth up the deep in storehouses.

8. Let all the earth fear the LORD; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!

9. For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.

10. The LORD bringeth the devices of the nations to nothing; He frustrateth the designs of kingdoms.

11. The purposes of the LORD stand for ever; The designs of his heart, to all generations.

12. Happy the nation whose God is Jehovah; The people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.

13. The LORD looketh down from heaven; He beholdeth all the children of men;

14. From his dwelling-place he beholdeth all the inhabitants of the earth,—

15. He that formed the hearts of all, And observeth all their works.

16. A king is not saved by the number of his forces, Nor a hero by the greatness of his strength.

17. The horse is a vain thing for safety, Nor can he deliver his master by his great strength.

18. Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him,—Upon them that trust in his goodness;

19. To save them from the power of death, And keep them alive in famine.

20. The hope of our souls is in the LORD; He is our help and our shield.

21. Yea, in him doth our heart rejoice; In his holy name we have confidence.

22. May thy goodness be upon us, O LORD! According as we trust in thee!

## Psalms 34

1. A psalm of David, when he feigned himself mad before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.  I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

2. In the LORD doth my soul boast; Let the afflicted hear, and rejoice!

3. O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt his name together!

4. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, And delivered me from all my fears.

5. Look up to him, and ye shall have light; Your faces shall never be ashamed.

6. This afflicted man cried, and the LORD heard, And saved him from all his troubles.

7. The angels of the LORD encamp around those who fear him, And deliver them.

8. O taste, and see how good is the LORD! Happy the man who trusteth in him!

9. O fear the LORD, ye his servants! For to those who fear him there shall be no want.

10. Young lions want, and suffer hunger; But they who fear the LORD want no good thing.

11. Come, ye children, hearken to me! I will teach you the fear of the LORD.

12. Who is he that loveth life, And desireth many days, in which he may see good?

13. Guard well thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile!

14. Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it!

15. The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, And his ears are open to their cry.

16. But the face of the LORD is against evil-doers, To cut off their remembrance from the earth.

17. The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, And delivereth them from all their troubles.

18. The LORD is near to them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.

22. The LORD redeemeth the life of his servants, And none that put their trust in him will suffer for it.

## Psalms 35

1. A psalm of David.  Contend, O LORD! with them that contend with me! Fight against them that fight against me!

2. Take hold of shield and buckler, And stand up for my help!

3. Draw forth the spear and the axe against my persecutors; Say to me, "I am thy salvation."

4. May they be confounded and put to shame, who seek my life; May they be turned back with disgrace, who devise my hurt!

5. May they be like dust before the wind; May the angel of the LORD drive them!

6. May their way be dark and slippery, And may the angel of the LORD pursue them!

7. For without cause they have laid for me a snare; Without cause they have digged for me a pit.

8. May unforeseen destruction come upon them! May the snare which they have laid lay hold on themselves, And may they fall into destruction!

9. Then shall my soul rejoice in the LORD; It shall exult in his protection.

10. All my bones shall say, Who, O LORD! is like thee, Who dost rescue the afflicted from the oppressor, The afflicted and destitute from the spoiler?

11. False witnesses have risen up; They charge me with that which has not entered my mind.

12. They repay me evil for good; They cause bereavement to my soul.

13. And yet I, during their sickness, clothed myself with sackcloth, And afflicted myself with fasting; And my prayer was turned to my bosom.

14. I behaved myself as if he had been my friend or brother; I bowed down in sadness, as one mourning for his mother.

15. But at my fall they rejoice, and gather themselves together; Revilers whom I know not assemble themselves against me; They tear me without ceasing.

16. With base men who mock for their bread, They gnash at me with their teeth.

17. How long, O LORD! wilt thou look on? O rescue my life from the destruction they plot for me; My precious life from these young lions!

18. I will thank thee in the great assembly! Before a numerous people I will praise thee.

19. Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully triumph over me; Let them not wink with the eye, who hate me without cause!

20. For they speak not peace; They devise deceit against them that are quiet in the land.

21. Yea, they open their mouths wide against me; They say, "Aha, aha! our eyes seeth it."

22. Thou seest it, O LORD! be not silent! O LORD! be not far from me!

23. Arouse thyself; awake for my defence! My God and my Lord, awake to my cause!

24. Judge me according to thy righteousness, O Jehovah, my God! Let them not triumph over me!

25. Let them not say in their hearts, "Aha! we have our wish!" Let them not say, "We have swallowed him up!"

26. May they all be confounded and brought to shame, Who rejoice at my calamity! May they be clothed with ignominy and disgrace, Who exalt themselves against me!

27. Let them shout for joy, and be glad, Who favor my righteous cause; Let them ever say, "The LORD be praised, Who delighteth in the prosperity of his servant!"

28. So shall my tongue speak of thy righteousness, And daily repeat thy praise.

## Psalms 36

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, the servant of the Lord.  To speak of the ungodliness of the wicked is in my heart. He hath no fear of God before his eyes.

2. For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, Till his iniquity is found out and hated.

3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; He neglecteth to be wise and to do good.

4. He deviseth mischief upon his bed; He persevereth in an evil way; He abhorreth not sin.

5. Thy goodness, O LORD! reacheth to the heavens, And thy faithfulness to the clouds;

6. Thy righteousness is like the high mountains; Thy judgments are a great deep; Thou, O LORD! preservest man and beast!

7. How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! Yea, the sons of men seek refuge under the shadow of thy wings.

8. They are satisfied with the abundance of thy house, And thou causest them to drink of the full stream of thy pleasures.

9. For with thee is the fountain of life; Through thy light we see light.

10. O continue thy loving-kindness to them that know thee, And thy favor to the upright in heart!

11. Let not the foot of the proud come upon me, Nor the hand of the wicked remove me!

12. Lo! already are the workers of iniquity fallen; They are cast down; they are unable to rise!

## Psalms 37

1. A psalm of David.  Be not thou angry on account of the wicked, Nor be envious of those who do iniquity.

2. For soon shall they be cut down like grass, And wither like the green herb.

3. Trust in the LORD, and do good; Abide in the land, and delight in faithfulness.

4. Place thy delight in the LORD. And he will give thee thy heart’s desires.

5. Commit thy way to the LORD; Trust in him, and he will give thee success!

6. He will cause thy justice to shine forth like the light, And thy righteousness like the noonday’s brightness.

7. Hope thou patiently on the LORD, And in him place thy trust! Be not angry on account of the prosperous,—On account of him that deviseth deceit!

8. Cease from anger; give not way to wrath; Be not provoked, so as to do evil!

9. For evil-doers shall be rooted out; But they who trust in the LORD, they shall inherit the land.

10. Yet a little while, and the wicked shall be no more; Thou mayst look for his place, and he will not be found.

11. But the meek shall inherit the land, And delight themselves in the fulness of prosperity.

12. The wicked man plotteth against the just, And gnasheth at him with his teeth.

13. The Lord laugheth at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.

14. The wicked draw the sword, And bend their bow, To cast down the afflicted and the needy, And to slay the upright.

15. Their swords shall enter their own hearts, And their bows shall be broken in pieces.

16. Better is the little of the righteous man Than the great abundance of the wicked;

17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, But the LORD will uphold the righteous.

18. The LORD careth for the life of the upright, And their inheritance shall endure for ever.

19. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, And in the days of famine they shall have enough.

20. But the wicked shall perish; Yea, the enemies of the LORD shall be consumed, like the glory of the fields; They shall be consumed into smoke.

21. The wicked borroweth, and repayeth not; But the righteous is merciful and bountiful.

22. For they who are blessed by God shall inherit the land, And they who are cursed by him shall be rooted out.

23. The steps of the good man are directed by the LORD; He delighteth himself in his way.

24. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, For the LORD holdeth him by the hand.

25. I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his offspring begging bread.

26. He is ever merciful and lendeth, And his offspring shall be blessed.

27. Depart from evil, and do good; So thou shalt dwell in the land for ever.

28. For the LORD loveth righteousness, And forsaketh not his servants; They are preserved for ever; But the posterity of the wicked shall be rooted out.

29. The righteous shall inherit the land, And shall dwell therein for ever.

30. The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue speaketh what is right.

31. The law of his God is in his heart; His footsteps shall not slip.

32. The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him;

33. The Lord will not leave him in his hand, Nor suffer him to be condemned, when he is judged.

34. Trust in the LORD, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to the possession of the land, Whilst thou shalt see the destruction of the wicked!

35. I have seen a wicked man in great power, And spreading himself like a green cedar;

36. But he passed away, and, lo! he was no more; Yea, I sought him, but he was not found.

37. Mark the righteous man, and behold the upright, That posterity is to the man of peace!

38. But transgressors will all be destroyed; The posterity of the wicked shall be rooted out.

39. The salvation of the just is from the LORD. He is their strength in the time of trouble.

40. The LORD will help and deliver them; He will deliver them from their enemies, and save them, Because they trust in him.

## Psalms 38

1. A psalm of David. To bring to remembrance.  O LORD! rebuke me not in thy wrath, Nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure!

2. For thine arrows have deeply pierced me, And thy hand hath been heavy upon me.

3. There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger; Nor rest in my bones, because of my sin.

4. For my iniquities have gone over my head; Like a heavy burden, they are more than I can bear.

5. My wounds putrefy and are loathsome on account of my folly.

6. I am bent; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

7. For my loins are full of burning heat, And there is no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am weakened and bruised exceedingly; I roar by reason of the disquietude of my heart.

9. O Lord! thou knowest all my desire, And my groaning is not hidden from thee!

10. My heart panteth; my strength faileth me; The very light of my eyes is gone from me.

11. My friends and acquaintance keep aloof from my woe, And my kinsmen stand afar off:

12. While they who seek my life lay snares for me; They who seek my hurt threaten destruction, And meditate deceit all the day long.

13. But I, like a deaf man, hear not; And, like a dumb man, open not my mouth.

14. I am like one who heareth nothing, And in whose mouth is no reply.

15. For in thee, O LORD! do I put my trust; Thou wilt hear, O Lord, my God!

16. For I have prayed, "Let them not rejoice over me; Let them not exult at the slipping of my feet!"

17. For I am ready to fall, And my pain doth never leave me;

18. For I confess my iniquity, And am troubled on account of my sin.

19. But my enemies flourish and are strong; They who hate me without cause are multiplied.

20. They who repay good with evil are my enemies, Because I follow that which is good.

21. Forsake me not, O LORD! O my God! be not far from me!

22. Make hast to mine aid, O Lord, my salvation!

## Psalms 39

1. A psalm of David. For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites.  I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I may not sin with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.

2. I was dumb with silence; I spake not even what was good; But my pain was increased.

3. My heart was hot within me; In my anguish the fire burst forth, And I spake with my tongue:

4. LORD, make me to know mine end, And the number of my days, That I may know how frail I am!

5. Behold, thou hast made my days as a hand-breadth, And my life is as nothing before thee; Yea, every man in his firmest state is altogether vanity. [Pause.]

6. Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely he disquieteth himself in vain; He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.

7. What, then, O Lord! is my hope? My hope is in thee!

8. Deliver me from all my transgressions; Let me not be the reproach of scoffers!

9. Yet I am dumb; I open not my mouth; For thou hast done it!

10. But remove from me thine infliction; For I am perishing by the blow of thine hand.

11. When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for iniquity, Thou causest his glory to waste away like a moth! Surely every man is vanity.

12. Hear my prayer, O LORD! Give ear to my cry; Be not silent at my tears! For I am but a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.

13. O spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go away, and be no more!

## Psalms 40

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  I trusted steadfastly in the LORD, And he listened, and heard my cry.

2. He drew me out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay; He set my feet upon a rock, And made my steps firm.

3. He hath put into my mouth a new song, A song of praise to our God. Many shall see, and fear, And put their trust in the LORD.

4. Happy the man who maketh the LORD his trust, And resorteth not to men of pride and falsehood!

5. Many, O LORD, my God! are the wonderful works which thou hast done; Many have been thy gracious purposes towards us; None can be compared to thee! Would I declare and rehearse them, they are more than can be numbered.

6. In sacrifice and oblation thou hast no pleasure; Mine ears thou hast opened; Burnt-offering and sin-offering thou requirest not.

7. Therefore I said, "Lo, I come; In the scroll of the book it is prescribed to me;

8. O my God! to do thy will is my delight, And thy law dwelleth in my heart!"

9. I have proclaimed thy righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I have not restrained my lips, O LORD! thou knowest!

10. I hide not thy justice in my heart; I declare thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I conceal not thy mercy and truth from the great assembly.

11. Withdraw not from me thy tender mercies, O LORD! May thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me!

12. For evils without number have encompassed me; My iniquities have overtaken me; I cannot see the end of them; They are more than the hairs of my head, And my heart dieth within me.

13. May it please thee, O LORD! to deliver me! O LORD! make haste to mine aid!

14. May they all be confounded and covered with shame Who seek to take away my life! Let them be driven back with disgrace Who desire to do me injury!

15. Let them be overwhelmed with confusion Who cry out to me, Aha! aha!

16. But let all who seek thee Be glad and rejoice in thee! Let those who love thy protection Ever say, "Great is Jehovah!"

17. I am poor and afflicted, yet the Lord thinketh upon me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; My God! make no delay!

## Psalms 41

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  Happy is he who hath regard to the poor! The LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

2. The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; He shall be happy on the earth; Thou wilt not give him up to the will of his enemies!

3. The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of disease; All his bed thou wilt change in his sickness.

4. I said, O LORD! be merciful to me! Heal me, for I have sinned against thee!

5. My enemies speak evil of me: "When will he die, and his name perish?"

6. If one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth malice; When he goeth abroad, he uttereth it.

7. All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise mischief:

8. "A deadly disease cleaveth fast unto him; He lieth down, and he shall never arise!"

9. Yea, my familiar friend in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread,—He hath lifted up his heel against me.

10. But do thou, O LORD! have pity upon me; Raise me up, that I may requite them!

11. By this I know that thou favorest me, Because my enemy doth not triumph over me.

12. As for me, thou wilt uphold me in my integrity; Thou wilt set me before thy face for ever!

13. Praised be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting. Amen! Amen!

## Psalms 42

1. BOOK II. For the leader of the music. A song of the sons of Korah.  As the hart panteth for the water-brooks, So panteth my soul for thee, O God!

2. My soul thirsteth for God, the living God: When shall I come, and appear before God?

3. My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me continually, "Where is thy God?"

4. When I think of it, I pour out my soul in grief; How I once walked with the multitude, Walked slowly with them to the house of God, Amid sounds of joy and praise with the festive multitude!

5. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!

6. My soul is cast down within me, While I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermon, From the mountain Mizar.

7. Deep calleth for deep at the noise of thy waterfalls; All thy waves and billows have gone over me!

8. Once the LORD commanded his kindness by day, And by night his praise was with me,-Thanksgiving to the God of my life.

9. Now I say to God, my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning on account of the oppression of the enemy?

10. Like the crushing of my bones are the reproaches of the enemy, While they say to me continually, "Where is thy God?"

11. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!

## Psalms 43

1. Judge me, O God! and defend my cause against a merciless nation! Deliver me from unjust and deceitful men!

2. Thou art the God of my refuge: why dost thou cast me off? Why go I mourning on account of the oppression of the enemy?

3. O send forth thy light and thy truth; let them guide me; Let them lead me to thy holy mountain, and to thy dwelling-place!

4. Then will I go to the altar of God, To the God of my joy and exultation; Yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God!

5. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!

## Psalms 44

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.  O God! we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have told us, What deeds thou didst in their days, In the days of old.

2. With thine own hand didst thou drive out the nations, And plant our fathers; Thou didst destroy the nations, And cause our fathers to flourish.

3. For not by their own swords did they gain possession of the land, Nor did their own arms give them victory; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance; For thou didst favor them!

4. Thou art my king, O God! O send deliverance to Jacob!

5. Through thee we may cast down our enemies; Through thy name we may trample upon our adversaries!

6. I trust not in my bow, Nor can my sword save me.

7. But it is thou only who savest us from our enemies, And puttest to shame those who hate us!

8. In God will we glory continually; Yea, we will praise thy name for ever! [Pause.]

9. Yet now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame; Thou goest not forth with our armies.

10. Thou makest us turn back from the enemy, And they who hate us make our goods their prey.

11. Thou makest us like sheep destined for food, And scatterest us among the nations.

12. Thou sellest thy people for nought, And increasest not thy wealth by their price.

13. Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, A scorn and a derision to those who are around us.

14. Thou makest us a byword among the nations, And causest the people to shake their heads at us.

15. My ignominy is continually before me, And shame covereth my face,

16. On account of the voice of the scoffer and the reviler, And on account of the enemy and the avenger.

17. All this hath come upon us; Yet have we not forgotten thee, Nor have we been false to thy covenant.

18. Our hearts, have not wandered from thee, Nor have our feet gone out of thy path;

19. Though thou hast crushed us in a land of jackals, And covered us with thick darkness.

20. If we had forgotten the name of our God, Or stretched forth our hands to a strange God,

21. Surely God would search it out; For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.

22. But for thy sake we are killed all the day; We are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

23. Awake! why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise! cast us not off for ever!

24. Wherefore dost thou hide thy face, And forget our affliction and oppression?

25. Our soul is bowed down to the dust; Our body cleaveth to the earth.

26. Arise, O thou, our strength! And deliver us, for thy mercy’s sake!

## Psalms 45

1. For the leader of the music. To be accompanied with the Shoshannim. A song of loveliness by the sons of Korah.  My heart is overflowing with a good matter; I will address my work to the king: May my tongue be like the pen of a ready writer!

2. Thou art the fairest of the sons of men; Grace is poured upon thy lips; For God hath blessed thee for ever!

3. Gird thy sword to thy thigh, thou hero!-Thy glory and ornament!

4. In thy glorious array ride forth victoriously, On account of truth and mildness and justice; And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things!

5. Thine arrows are sharp; Nations shall fall before thee; They shall pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies.

6. Thy throne is God’s for ever and ever; The sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of equity!

7. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest iniquity; Therefore hath God, thy God, anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows!

8. All thy garments are myrrh, aloes, and cassia; From ivory palaces stringed instruments delight thee.

9. Daughters of kings are among thy chosen women; On the right hand stands the queen In gold of Ophir.

10. Listen, O daughter! consider, and incline thine ear; Forget thy people and thy father’s house!

11. For the king is captivated with thy beauty; He is now thy lord; honor thou him!

12. So shall the daughter of Tyre seek thy favor with gifts, The rich among the people.

13. All glorious is the king’s daughter in her apartment; Her robe is embroidered with gold.

14. In variegated garments shall she be led to the king; The virgin companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.

15. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; They shall enter the king’s palace.

16. Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, Whom thou shalt make princes through all the land.

17. I will make thy name memorable throughout all generations; So shall the nations praise thee for ever and ever!

## Psalms 46

1. For the leader of the music. Of, or for, the sons of Korah. To be sung in the manner, or with the voice, of virgins.  God is our refuge and strength; An ever present help in trouble.

2. Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be changed; Though the mountains tremble in the heart of the sea;

3. Though its waters roar and be troubled, And the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. [Pause.]

4. A river with its streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling-place of the Most High.

5. God is the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her, and that full early.

6. The nations raged; kingdoms were moved; He uttered his voice, the earth melted.

7. The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. [Pause.]

8. Come, behold the doings of the LORD; What desolations he hath made in the earth!

9. He causeth wars to cease to the end of the earth; He hath broken the bow, and snapped the spear asunder, And burned the chariots in fire.

10. "Desist, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted throughout the earth!"

11. The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge.

## Psalms 47

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.  O clap your hands, all ye nations! Shout unto God with the voice of triumph!

2. For terrible is Jehovah, the Most High, The great king over all the earth.

3. He hath subdued nations under us, And kingdoms under our feet;

4. He hath chosen for us an inheritance, The glory of Jacob, whom he loved. [Pause.]

5. God goeth up with a shout; Jehovah with the sound of the trumpet.

6. Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our king, sing praises!

7. For God is king of all the earth; Sing to him hymns of praise!

8. God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne.

9. The princes of the nations gather themselves together To the people of the God of Abraham; For the mighty of the earth belong to God; He is supremely exalted.

## Psalms 48

1. A psalm of the sons of Korah.  Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, upon his holy mountain.

2. Beautiful in its elevation is Mount Zion, The joy of the whole earth; The joy of the farthest North is the city of the great king;

3. In her palaces God is known as a refuge.

4. For, lo! kings were assembled against it; They passed away together.

5. As soon as they saw, they were astonished; They were confounded, and hasted away.

6. There terror seized upon them,—Pain, as of a woman in travail;

7. As when the east wind breaketh in pieces The ships of Tarshish.

8. As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish it for ever. [Pause.]

9. We think of thy loving-kindness, O God! In the midst of thy temple!

10. As thy name, O God! so thy praise, extendeth to the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.

11. Mount Zion rejoiceth, The daughters of Judah exult, On account of thy righteous judgments.

12. Go round about Zion; number her towers;

13. Mark well her bulwarks; count her palaces; That ye may tell it to the next generation!

14. For this God is our God for ever and ever; He will be our guide unto death.

## Psalms 49

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.  Hear this, all ye nations; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world;

2. Both high and low, rich and poor alike!

3. My mouth shall speak wisdom, And the meditation of my mind shall be understanding.

4. I will incline mine ear to a poem; I will utter my song upon the harp.

5. Why should I fear in the days of adversity, When the iniquity of my adversaries encompasseth me;

6. They who trust in their riches, And glory in the greatness of their wealth?

7. No one can redeem his brother from death, Nor give a ransom for him to God,

8. That he should live to eternity, And not see the pit.

9. Too costly is the redemption of his life, And he giveth it up for ever.

10. For he seeth that wise men die, As well as the foolish and the ignorant; They perish alike, And leave their wealth to others.

11. They imagine that their houses will endure for ever, And their dwelling-places from generation to generation: Men celebrate their names on the earth.

12. Yet man, who is in honor, abideth not; He is like the beasts that perish.

13. Such is the way which is their confidence! And they who come after them approve their maxims. [Pause.]

14. Like sheep they are cast into the underworld; Death shall feed upon them; And the upright shall soon trample upon them. Their form shall be consumed in the underworld, And they shall no more have a dwelling-place.

15. But God will redeem my life from the underworld; Yea, he will take me under his care. [Pause.]

16. Be not thou afraid, when one becometh rich; When the glory of his house is increased!

17. For, when he dieth, he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him.

18. Though in his life he thought himself happy,—Though men praised thee, while thou wast in prosperity,—

19. Yet shalt thou go to the dwelling-place of thy fathers, Who never more shall see the light!

20. The man who is in honor, but without understanding, Is like the beasts that perish.

## Psalms 50

1. A psalm of Asaph.  The mighty God, Jehovah, speaketh, and calleth the earth, From the rising of the sun to its going down.

2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shineth forth.

3. Our God cometh, and will not be silent; Before him is a devouring fire, And around him a raging tempest.

4. He calleth to the heavens on high, And to the earth, while he judgeth his people:

5. "Gather together before me my godly ones, Who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice!"

6. (And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, For it is God himself that is judge.) [Pause.]

7. "Hear, O my people, and I will speak! O Israel, and I will testify against thee! For I am God, thine own God.

8. I reprove thee not on account of thy sacrifices; For thy burnt-offerings are ever before me.

9. I will take no bullock from thy house, Nor he-goat from thy folds;

10. For all the beasts of the forest are mine, And the cattle on a thousand hills.

11. I know all the birds of the mountains, And the wild beasts of the field are before me.

12. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and all that is therein.

13. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?

14. Offer to God thanksgiving, And pay thy vows to the Most High!

15. Then call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me!"

16. And to the wicked God saith, "To what purpose dost thou talk of my statutes? And why hast thou my laws upon thy lips?—

17. Thou, who hatest instruction And castest my words behind thee!

18. When thou seest a thief, thou art in friendship with him, And hast fellowship with adulterers.

19. Thou lettest loose thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit;

20. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.

21. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Hence thou thoughtest that I was altogether like thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set it in order before thine eyes.

22. Mark this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and none deliver you!

23. Whoso offereth praise honoreth me; And to him who hath regard to his ways Will I show salvation from God."

## Psalms 51

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after his intercourse with Bathsheba.  Be gracious unto me, O God! according to thy loving kindness; According to the greatness of thy mercy, blot out my transgressions!

2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin!

3. For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.

4. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And in thy sight have I done evil; So that thou art just in thy sentence, And righteous in thy judgment.

5. Behold! I was born in iniquity, And in sin did my mother conceive me.

6. Behold! thou desirest truth in the heart; So teach me wisdom in my inmost soul!

7. Purge me with hyssop, until I be clean; Wash me, until I be whiter than snow!

8. Make me to hear joy and gladness, So that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice!

9. Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities!

10. Create within me a clean heart, O God! Renew within me a steadfast spirit!

11. Cast me not away from thy presence, And take not thy holy spirit from me!

12. Restore to me the joy of thy protection, And strengthen me with a willing spirit!

13. Then will I teach thy ways to transgressors, And sinners shall be converted to thee.

14. Deliver me from the guilt of blood, O God, the God of my salvation! That my tongue may sing aloud of thy goodness!

15. O Lord! open thou my lips, That my mouth may show forth thy praise!

16. For thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.

17. The sacrifice which God loveth is a broken spirit; A broken and contrite heart, O God! thou wilt not despise!

18. Do good to Zion according to thy mercy; Build up the walls of Jerusalem!

19. Then shalt thou be pleased with sacrifices of righteousness, With burnt-offerings and complete offerings; Then shall bullocks be offered upon thine altar.

## Psalms 52

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, and said to him, David is come to the house of Abimelech.  Why gloriest thou in mischief, thou man of violence? The goodness of God yet continueth daily.

2. Thy tongue deviseth mischief, Like a sharp razor, thou contriver of deceit!

3. Thou lovest evil more than good, And to lie more than to speak truth. [Pause.]

4. Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue!

5. Thee also shall God utterly destroy! o He shall seize thee, and tear thee from thy dwelling-place, And uproot thee from the land of the living. [Pause.]

6. The righteous shall see and fear, And shall laugh at him.

7. "Behold the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And placed his strength in his wickedness!"

8. But I shall be like a green olive-tree in the house of God; I will trust in the goodness of God for ever and ever.

9. I will praise thee for ever for what thou hast done; I will trust in thy name, because it is good, Before the eyes of thy godly ones!

## Psalms 53

1. For the leader of the music. To be sung on wind instruments. A psalm of David.  The fool saith in his heart, "There is no God!" They are corrupt; their doings are abominable; There is none that doeth good.

2. God looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any that have understanding, That have regard to God.

3. They are all gone astray; together are they corrupt; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.

4. Shall not the evil-doers be requited, Who eat up my people like bread, And call not upon God?

5. Yea! fear shall come upon them, Where no fear is; For God will scatter the bones of him that encampeth against thee; Thou shalt put them to shame, for God despiseth them!

6. O that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captives of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel be glad.

## Psalms 54

1. For the leader of the music. To be sung on stringed instruments A psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?  Save me, O God! by thy name, And by thy strength defend my cause!

2. O God! hear my prayer, Give ear to the words of my mouth!

3. For enemies have risen up against me, And oppressors seek my life; They have not set God before their eyes. [Pause.]

4. Behold! God is my helper; The Lord is the support of my life.

5. He will repay evil to my enemies; For thy truth’s sake, O God! cut them off!

6. With a willing heart will I sacrifice to thee; I will praise thy name, O LORD! for it is good;

7. For thou hast delivered me from all trouble, So that my eye hath looked with joy upon my enemies!

## Psalms 55

1. For the leader of the music. To be sung on stringed instruments. A psalm of David.  Give ear to my prayer, O God! Hide not thyself from my supplication!

2. Attend unto me, and hear me! I wander about mourning and wailing,

3. On account of the clamors of the enemy, On account of the violence of the wicked. For they bring evil upon me, And in wrath set themselves against me.

4. My heart trembleth in my bosom, And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

5. Fear and trembling have seized me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.

6. Then I say, O that I had wings like a dove! For then would I fly away, and be at rest.

7. Behold, I would wander far away, And take up my abode in a wilderness. [Pause.]

8. I would hasten away to a shelter From the rushing wind and tempest.

9. Confound, O Lord! divide their counsels! For I behold violence and strife in the city.

10. Day and night do these go about its walls; In the midst of it are iniquity and mischief.

11. Wickedness is in the midst of it; Oppression and fraud depart not from its streets.

12. It was not an enemy that reviled me, Then I could have borne it; Nor one that hated me, who rose up against me; From him I could have hid myself.

13. But it was thou, a man my equal, My friend, and my acquaintance.

14. We held sweet converse together, And walked to the house of God in company.

15. May sudden death seize upon them! May they go down to the underworld alive! For wickedness is in their dwellings, in the midst of them.

16. As for me, I will call upon God, And Jehovah will save me.

17. At evening, at morn, and at noon I mourn and sigh, And he will hear my voice.

18. He will deliver me in peace from my conflict; For many have risen up against me.

19. God will hear me, and bring them down,—He that hath been judge of old. [Pause.] Because they have no changes, Therefore they fear not God.

20. They lift up their hands against their friend, And break their covenant with him.

21. Their speech was softer than butter, But war was in their heart; Their words were smoother than oil, Yet were they drawn swords.

22. "Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain thee; He will never suffer the righteous to fall!"

23. Yea, thou, O God! wilt bring them down into the lowest pit! Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in thee!

## Psalms 56

1. For the leader of the music. To be sung to the tune of "The dumb dove among strangers." A psalm of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.  Have pity upon me, O God! for man panteth for my life; My adversary daily oppresseth me!

2. Mine enemies daily pant for my life, And many are they who war proudly against me.

3. When I am in fear, I will put my trust in thee!

4. Through God shall I praise his word; In God do I put my trust; I will not fear; What can flesh do to me?

5. Every day they wrest my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.

6. They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they watch my steps, Lying in wait for my life.

7. Shall they escape by their iniquity? In thine anger cast down the people, O God!

8. Count thou my wanderings; Put my tears into thy bottle! Are they not recorded in thy book?

9. When I cry to thee, my enemies shall turn back; This I know, that God is for me.

10. Through God shall I praise his word; I shall glory in the promise of Jehovah.

11. In God do I put my trust; I will not fear: What can man do to me?

12. Thy vows are upon me, O God! I will render praises to thee!

13. For thou hast delivered me from death, Yea, my feet from falling, That I may walk before God in the light of the living.

## Psalms 57

1. For the leader of the music. To be sung to the tune of "Do not destroy." A psalm of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.  Have pity upon me, O God! have pity upon me, For in thee doth my soul seek refuge! Yea, in the shadow of thy wings do I take shelter, Until these calamities be overpast!

2. I call upon God the Most High, Upon God, who performeth all things for me;

3. He will send from heaven, and save me; He will put to shame him that panteth for my life; [Pause.] God will send forth his mercy and his truth.

4. My life is in the midst of lions; I dwell among them that breathe out fire; Among men whose teeth are spears and arrows, And whose tongue is a sharp sword.

5. Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth!

6. They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They have digged a pit before me, But into it they have themselves fallen.

7. My heart is strengthened, O God! my heart is strengthened! I will sing, and give thanks.

8. Awake, my soul! awake, psaltery and harp! I will wake with the early dawn.

9. I will praise thee, O Lord! among the nations; I will sing to thee among the kingdoms!

10. For thy mercy reacheth to the heavens, And thy truth to the clouds!

11. Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth!

## Psalms 58

1. For the leader of the music. To the tune of "Do not destroy." A psalm of David.  Do ye, indeed, administer justice faithfully, ye mighty ones? Do ye judge with uprightness, ye sons of men?

2. Nay, in your hearts ye contrive iniquity; Your hands weigh out violence in the land!

3. The wicked are estranged, from their very birth; The liars go astray as soon as they are born.

4. They have poison, like the poison of a serpent; Like the deaf adder’s, which stoppeth her ear;

5. Which listeneth not to the voice of the charmer, And of the sorcerer, skilful in incantations.

6. Break their teeth, O God! in their mouths! Break out the great teeth of the lions, O LORD!

7. May they melt like waters, which flow away; May their arrows, when they aim them, be as if cut in pieces!

8. May they be like the snail, which melteth away as it goeth; Like the abortion of a woman, that seeth not the sun!

9. Before your pots feel the heat of the thorns, Whether fresh, or burning, may they be blown away!

10. The righteous shall rejoice, when he seeth such vengeance; He shall bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.

11. Then shall men say, "Truly there is a reward for the righteous! Truly there is a God who is judge upon the earth!"

## Psalms 59

1. For the leader of the music. To the tune of "Do not destroy." A psalm of David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.  Deliver me from my enemies, O my God! Defend me from them that rise up against me!

2. Deliver me from the doers of iniquity, And save me from men of blood!

3. For, lo! they lie in wait for my life; The mighty are gathered against me, Without any offence or fault of mine, O LORD!

4. Without any offence of mine, they run and prepare themselves; Awake to help me, and behold!

5. Do thou, O Jehovah, God of hosts, God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations! Show no mercy to any wicked transgressors! [Pause.]

6. Let them return at evening, Let them howl like dogs, And go round about the city!

7. Behold! with their mouths they belch out malice; Swords are upon their lips; "For who," say they, "will hear?"

8. Yet thou, O LORD! wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt hold all the nations in derision!

9. O my Strength! to thee will I look! For God is my defence;

10. My God will come to meet me with his mercy; God will cause me to look with joy upon my enemies.

11. Slay them not, lest my people forget; Scatter them by thy power, and cast them down, O Lord, our shield!

12. The word of their lips is the sin of their mouth; Let them be overtaken in their pride, For the curses and the falsehood which they utter!

13. Consume them in thy wrath; consume them that they be no more, That they may know that God ruleth in Jacob, Even to the ends of the earth! [Pause.]

14. Let them return at evening, Let them howl like dogs, And go round about the city!

15. Let them wander about for food, When they have passed the night unsatisfied!

16. But I will sing of thy power; Yea, in the morning will I sing aloud of thy mercy; For thou hast been my defence, My refuge in the day of my distress.

17. To thee, O my Strength! will I sing! For God is my defence; a God of mercy to me.

## Psalms 60

1. For the leader of the music; upon the Shushan-Eduth; a psalm of David for instruction; when he was at strife with the Syrians of Mesopotamia, and the Syrians of Zoba; when Joab returned, and smote twelve thousand Edomites in the valley of Salt.  O God! thou hast forsaken us; thou hast broken us in pieces; Thou hast been angry! O revive us again!

2. Thou hast made the land tremble; thou hast rent it; O heal its breaches, for it tottereth!

3. Thou hast caused thy people to see hard things; Thou hast made us drink the wine of reeling.

4. Lift up a banner for them that fear thee, For the sake of thy faithfulness, that they may escape!

5. That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer me!

6. God promiseth in his holiness; I will rejoice; I shall yet divide Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth.

7. Gilead shall be mine, and mine Manasseh; Ephraim shall be my helmet, And Judah my sceptre;

8. Moab shall be my wash-bowl; Upon Edom shall I cast my shoe; I shall triumph over Philistia!

9. Who will bring me to the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?

10. Wilt not thou, O God! who didst forsake us, And didst not go forth with our armies?

11. Give us thine aid in our distress, For vain is the help of man!

12. Through God we shall do valiantly; For he will tread down our enemies.

## Psalms 61

1. For the leader of the music. To be sung upon stringed instruments. A psalm of David.  Hear my cry, O God! Attend to my prayer!

2. From the extremity of the land I cry unto thee in deep sorrow of heart; Lead me to the rock that is high above me!

3. For thou art my refuge, My strong tower against the enemy.

4. I shall dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will seek refuge under the covert of thy wings.

5. For thou, O God! wilt hear my vows, And give me the inheritance of those who fear thy name.

6. O prolong the life of the king! May his years extend through many generations!

7. May he reign for ever before God! Grant that mercy and truth may preserve him!

8. So will I sing praise to thy name for ever; I will daily perform my vows.

## Psalms 62

1. For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites, A psalm of David.  Truly my soul resteth on God alone; From him cometh my deliverance!

2. He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my safeguard, I shall not wholly fall!

3. How long will ye continue to assault a single man? How long will ye all seek to destroy me, Like a bending wall, or a tottering fence?

4. They study how to cast me down from my eminence; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse.

5. My soul, rest thou on God alone, For from him cometh my hope!

6. He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my safeguard, —I shall not fall.

7. From God cometh my help and my glory: My strong rock, my refuge, is God.

8. Trust in him at all times, ye people! Pour out your hearts before him! God is our refuge!

9. Truly men of low degree are vanity, And men of high degree are a lie; Placed in the balance, They are all lighter than vanity.

10. Trust not in extortion; Place no vain hopes in rapine! If riches increase, set not your heart upon them!

11. Once hath God promised, twice have I heard it, That power belongeth unto God.

12. To thee also, O Lord! belongeth mercy; For thou dost render to every man according to his work!

## Psalms 63

1. A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.  O God! thou art my God! earnestly do I seek thee! My soul thirsteth, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry, thirsty land. where is no water!

2. Thus I look toward thee in thy sanctuary, To behold thy power and thy glory!

3. For thy loving-kindness is better than life; Therefore my lips shall praise thee!

4. Thus will I bless thee, while I live; In thy name will I lift up my hands!

5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And with joyful lips my mouth shall praise thee,

6. When I think of thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches.

7. For thou art my help, And in the shadow of thy wings I rejoice.

8. My soul cleaveth to thee; Thy right hand holdeth me up.

9. While they who seek to destroy my life Shall themselves go down into the depths of the earth.

10. They shall be given up to the sword, And be a portion for jackals.

11. But the king shall rejoice in God; All that swear by him shall be honored; But the mouth of liars shall be stopped.

## Psalms 64

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  Hear my voice, O God! when I pray! Preserve my life from the terrors of the enemy!

2. Hide me from the assembly of the wicked, From the brawling crowd of evil-doers!

3. For like a sword they sharpen their tongues, Like arrows they aim their poisoned words,

4. To shoot in secret at the upright; Suddenly do they shoot at him without fear.

5. They prepare themselves for an evil deed; They commune of laying secret snares: "Who," say they, "will see them?"

6. They meditate crimes: "We have finished," say they, "our plans!" The heart and bosom of every one of them are deep.

7. But God will shoot an arrow at them; Suddenly shall they be wounded.

8. Thus their own tongues shall bring them down; All who see them will flee away.

9. Then will all men stand in awe, And declare what God hath done, And attentively consider his work.

10. The righteous shall rejoice, and trust in the LORD; All the upright in heart shall glory.

## Psalms 65

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  To thee belongeth trust, to thee praise, O God in Zion! And to thee shall the vow be performed!

2. O Thou that hearest prayer! To thee shall all flesh come!

3. My iniquities are heavy upon me; But thou wilt forgive our transgressions!

4. Happy is he whom thou choosest, And bringest near thee to dwell in thy courts! May we be satisfied with the blessings of thy house, Thy holy temple!

5. By wonderful deeds dost thou answer us in thy goodness, O God, our salvation! Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of the most distant seas!

6. Thou makest fast the mountains by thy power, Being girded with strength!

7. Thou stillest the roar of the sea, The roar of its waves, And the tumult of the nations.

8. They who dwell in the ends of the earth are awed by thy signs; Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to rejoice!

9. Thou visitest the earth and waterest it; Thou enrichest it exceedingly; The river of God is full of water. Thou suppliest the earth with corn, When thou hast thus prepared it.

10. Thou waterest its furrows, And breakest down its ridges; Thou makest it soft with showers, And blessest its increase.

11. Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; Thy footsteps drop fruitfulness;

12. They drop it upon the pastures of the wilderness, And the hills are girded with gladness.

13. The pastures are clothed with flocks, And the valleys are covered with corn; They shout, yea, they sing for joy.

## Psalms 66

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm.  Shout joyfully unto God. all ye lands!

2. Sing ye the honor of his name; Make his praise glorious!

3. Say unto God, How terrible are thy doings! Through the greatness of thy power thine enemies are suppliants to thee!

4. Let all the earth worship thee; Let it sing praise to thee, let it sing praise to thy name! [Pause.]

5. Come, behold the works of God! How terrible his doings among the sons of men!

6. He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the deep on foot; Then we rejoiced in him.

7. By his power he ruleth for ever; His eyes are fixed upon the nations; Let not the rebellious exalt themselves! [Pause.]

8. O bless our God, ye nations. And make the voice of his praise to be heard!

9. It is he who preserveth our lives, And suffereth not our feet to stumble.

10. Thou hast, indeed, proved us, O God! Thou hast tried us as silver is tried.

11. Thou broughtest us into a snare, And didst lay a heavy burden upon our backs;

12. Thou didst cause men to ride upon our heads, And we have gone through fire and water: But thou hast brought us to a place of abundance.

13. I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings! I will pay thee my vows,—

14. The vows which my lips uttered. Which my mouth promised in my trouble.

15. Burnt sacrifices of fatlings will I offer to thee with the fat of rams; Bullocks, with he-goats, will I sacrifice to thee. [Pause.]

16. Come and hear, all ye who fear God, And I will relate what he hath done for me!

17. I called upon him with my mouth, And praise is now upon my tongue.

18. If I had meditated wickedness in my heart, The Lord would not have heard me:

19. But surely God hath heard me; He hath had regard to the voice of my supplication.

20. Blessed be God, who did not reject my prayer, Nor withhold his mercy from me!

7. May God continue to bless us, And may all the ends of the earth fear him!

## Psalms 68

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  Let God arise, and his enemies are scattered, And they who hate him flee before him!

2. As smoke is dispersed, so thou dispersest them; As wax melteth before the fire, So perish the wicked before the face of God.

3. But the righteous are glad and rejoice in his presence, Yea, they exult exceedingly.

4. Sing unto God; sing praises to his name! Prepare a way for him who rideth through the desert! Jehovah is his name; be joyful in his presence!

5. The father of the fatherless, and the protector of the widow, Is God in his holy habitation.

6. God causeth the forsaken to dwell in houses; He leadeth forth to prosperity them that are bound; But the rebellious shall dwell in a barren land.

7. O God! when thou didst go before thy people, When thou didst march through the wilderness. [Pause.]

8. The earth quaked, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God; This Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

9. Thou, O God! didst send a plentiful rain; Thou didst strengthen thy wearied inheritance.

10. Thy people established themselves in the land; Thou, O God! in thy goodness, didst prepare it for the needy!

11. The Lord gave the song of victory Of the maidens publishing glad tidings to the mighty host.

12. "The kings with their armies have fled, —have fled! And the matron at home divideth the spoil.

13. Truly ye may repose yourselves in the stalls, Like the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her feathers with shining gold."

14. When the Most High destroyed the kings in the land, It was white [with their bones] like Salmon.

15. Ye lofty hills, ye hills of Bashan, Ye many-topped hills, ye hills of Bashan,

16. Why frown ye, ye many-topped hills, At the hill in which God is pleased to dwell, In which Jehovah will dwell for ever?

17. The chariots of God are myriads, yea, thousands of thousands; The Lord is in the midst of them, as upon Sinai, in the sanctuary.

18. Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captive the vanquished, Thou hast received gifts among men, Even the rebellious, that here thou mightst dwell, O LORD God!

19. Praised be the Lord daily! When we are heavy-laden, the Mighty One is our help.

20. Our God is a God of salvation; From the Lord Jehovah cometh deliverance from death.

21. But God smiteth the head of his enemies, Even the hairy crowns of those who go on in their iniquity.

22. "I will bring them back," saith the Lord, "from Bashan; I will bring them back from the deep sea;

23. That thy foot may be dipped in their blood, That thy dogs may drink the blood of thine enemies."

24. We have seen thy procession, O God! The procession of my God, my king, to his sanctuary!

25. The singers go before, the minstrels follow, Amidst damsels playing on timbrels.

26. Praise ye God in your assemblies; Praise the Lord, all ye from the fountain of Israel!

27. Here is Benjamin, the youngest, and his leaders; The chiefs of Judah, and their band; The chiefs of Zebulon, and the chiefs of Naphtali.

28. Thy God has ordained thy strength, [O Israel!] Show forth thy might, O God! thou who hast wrought for us!

29. Because of thy temple in Jerusalem Shall kings bring presents to thee.

30. Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The multitude of bulls with the calves of the nations, So that they shall cast themselves down with masses of silver; Scatter thou the nations that delight in war!

31. Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste with outstretched hands to God.

32. Ye kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God; Sing praises to Jehovah;

33. To him who rideth upon the ancient heaven of heavens! Behold, he uttereth his voice, his mighty voice!

34. Give glory to God, Whose majesty is in Israel, and whose might is in the clouds!

35. Terrible art thou, O God! from thy sanctuary! The God of Israel giveth strength and power to his people. Praised be God!

## Psalms 69

1. For the leader of the music. Upon the Shoshannim. A psalm of David.  Save me, O God! For the waters press in to my very life!

2. I sink in deep mire, where is no standing; I have come into deep waters, and the waves flow over me.

3. I am weary with crying; my throat is parched; Mine eyes are wasted, while I wait for my God.

4. More numerous than the hairs of my head are they who hate me without reason; Mighty are they who seek to destroy me, being my enemies without cause: I must restore what I took not away.

5. O God! thou knowest my offences, And my sins are not hidden from thee!

6. Let not them that trust in thee through me be put to shame, O Lord Jehovah, God of hosts! Let not them that seek thee through me be confounded, O God of Israel!

7. For on account of thee do I suffer reproach, And shame covereth my face!

8. I am become a stranger to my brothers; Yea, an alien to my mother’s sons.

9. For zeal for thy house consumeth me, And the reproaches of them that reproach thee fall upon me.

10. When I weep and fast, That is made my reproach;

11. When I clothe myself in sackcloth, Then I become their by-word.

12. They who sit in the gate speak against me, And I am become the song of drunkards.

13. Yet will I address my prayer to thee, O LORD! May it be in an acceptable time according to thy great goodness! Hear, O God! and afford me thy sure help!

14. Save me from the mire, and let me not sink; May I be delivered from my enemies,—from the deep waters!

15. Let not the water-flood overflow me; Let not the deep swallow me up, And let not the pit close her mouth upon me!

16. Hear me, O LORD! since great is thy loving-kindness; According to the abundance of thy tender mercies look upon me!

17. Hide not thy face from thy servant; I am greatly distressed, O make haste to mine aid!

18. Draw near to me, and redeem my life; Deliver me because of my enemies!

19. Thou knowest my reproach, and dishonor, and shame; All my adversaries are in thy view!

20. Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness; I look for pity, but there is none; For comforters, but find none.

21. For my food they give me gall, And in my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.

22. May their table be to them a snare; May it be a trap to them, while they are at ease!

23. May their eyes be darkened, that they may not see; And cause their loins continually to shake!

24. Pour out upon them thine indignation, And may the heat of thine anger overtake them!

25. Let their habitation be desolate, And let none dwell in their tents!

26. For they persecute those whom thou hast smitten, And talk of the pain of those whom thou hast wounded.

27. Add iniquity to their iniquity, And let them never come into thy favor!

28. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; Let not their names be written with the righteous!

29. But I am poor, and sorrowful: May thine aid, O God! set me on high!

30. Then I will praise the name of God in a song; I will give glory to him with thanksgiving.

31. More pleasing shall this be to the LORD Than a full-horned and full-hoofed bullock.

32. The afflicted shall see, and rejoice; The hearts of them that fear God shall be revived.

33. For the LORD heareth the poor, And despiseth not his people in their bonds.

34. Let the heaven and the earth praise him; The sea, and all that move therein!

35. For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah, That they may dwell therein, and possess it.

36. Yea, the posterity of his servants shall possess it, And they that love him shall dwell therein.

## Psalms 70

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, for remembrance.  Make haste, O God! to deliver me, O LORD! come speedily to mine aid!

2. May they all be confounded, and covered with shame, Who seek to take my life! May they be driven back with disgrace Who desire to do me injury!

3. May they be turned back with shame Who cry out to me, "Aha! aha!"

4. But let all who seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee! Let them that love thy protection ever say, "May God be praised!"

5. But I am poor and needy; O God! hasten to mine aid! Thou art my help and my deliverer, O LORD! make no delay!

## Psalms 71

1. In thee, O LORD! do I put my trust! Let me never be put to shame!

2. In thy goodness deliver and rescue me; Incline thine ear to me, and save me!

3. Be thou the rock of my abode, where I may continually resort! Thou hast granted me deliverance; For thou art my rock and my fortress!

4. Save me, O my God! from the hand of the wicked,-From the hand of the unjust and cruel!

5. For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah! Thou hast been my trust from my youth!

6. Upon thee have I leaned from my birth; From my earliest breath thou hast been my support; My song hath been continually of thee!

7. I am a wonder to many, But thou art my strong refuge.

8. Let my mouth be filled with thy praise; Yea, all the day long, with thy glory.

9. Cast me not off in mine old age; Forsake me not, When my strength faileth!

10. For my enemies speak against me, And they who lay wait for my life consult together:

11. "God," say they, "hath forsaken him; Pursue and seize him; for he hath none to deliver him!"

12. O God! be not far from me! Come speedily to mine aid, O my God!

13. Let them perish with shame who are my enemies; Let them be covered with contempt and dishonor who seek my hurt!

14. But I will hope continually; I shall yet praise thee more and more.

15. My mouth shall speak of thy goodness,—Of thy sure protection all the day long; For thy mercies are more than I can number.

16. I will celebrate thy mighty deeds, O Lord Jehovah! I will make mention of thy goodness, of thine only!

17. O God! thou hast taught me from my youth, And thus far have I declared thy wondrous deeds;

18. And now, when I am old and gray-headed, O God! forsake me not, Until I make known thine arm to the next generation,-Thy mighty power to all that are to come!

19. For thy goodness, O God! reacheth to the heavens; Wonderful things doest thou! O God! who is like unto thee?

20. Thou hast suffered us to see great and grievous troubles; Thou wilt again give us life, And wilt bring us back from the depths of the earth!

21. Thou wilt increase my greatness; Thou wilt again comfort me!

22. Then will I praise thee with the psaltery; Even thy faithfulness, O my God! To thee will I sing with the harp, O Holy One of Israel!

23. My lips shall rejoice, when I sing to thee; And my soul, which thou hast redeemed from death;

24. My tongue also shall continually speak of thy righteousness: For all who seek my hurt are brought to shame and confounded.

## Psalms 72

1. For Solomon.  To the king, O God! give thy justice, And to the son of a king thy righteousness!

2. Yea! he shall judge thy people with equity, And thine oppressed ones with justice.

3. For the mountains shall bring forth peace to the people, And the hills, through righteousness.

4. He shall defend the oppressed of the people; He shall save the needy, And break in pieces the oppressor.

5. They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon shall endure, From generation to generation.

6. He shall be like rain descending on the mown field,—Like showers which water the earth.

7. In his days shall the righteous flourish, And great shall be their prosperity, as long as the moon shall endure.

8. He shall have dominion from sea to sea, And from the river to the ends of the earth.

9. They that dwell in the desert shall bow before him, And his enemies shall lick the dust.

10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts;

11. Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; All nations shall serve him.

12. For he shall deliver the poor who crieth for aid, And the oppressed who hath no helper.

13. He shall spare the weak and needy, And save the lives of the poor.

14. He shall redeem them from deceit and violence, And their blood shall be precious in his sight.

15. He shall prosper, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba; Prayer also shall be made for him continually, And daily shall he be praised.

16. There shall be an abundance of corn in the land; Its fruit shall shake like Lebanon, even on the tops of the mountains; And they of the cities shall flourish as the grass of the earth.

17. His name shall endure for ever; His name shall be continued as long as the sun. By him shall men bless themselves; All nations shall call him blessed.

18. [Praised be God, Jehovah, the God of Israel, Who alone doeth wonderful things!

19. Praised be his glorious name for ever! May his glory fill the whole earth! Amen, Amen!

20. Here end the Psalms of David, the son of Jesse.]

## Psalms 73

1. BOOK III. A psalm of Asaph.  Truly God is good to Israel,—To those who are pure in heart.

2. Yet my feet almost gave way; My steps had well nigh slipped:

3. For I was envious of the proud, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

4. For they have no pains even to their death; Their bodies are in full health.

5. They have not the woes of other men, Neither are they smitten like other men.

6. Therefore pride encircleth their neck as a collar; Violence covereth them as a garment.

7. From their bosom issueth their iniquity; The designs of their hearts burst forth.

8. They mock, and speak of malicious oppression; Their words are haughty;

9. They stretch forth their mouth to the heavens, And their tongue goeth through the earth;

10. Therefore his people walk in their ways, And there drink from full fountains.

11. And they say, "How doth God know? How can there be knowledge with the Most High?"

12. Behold these are the ungodly! Yet they are ever prosperous; they heap up riches.

13. Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain; In vain have I washed my hands in innocence.

14. For every day have I been smitten; Every morn have I been chastened.

15. If I should resolve to speak like them, Surely I should be treacherous to the family of thy children.

16. So, when I studied to know this, It was painful to my eyes;

17. Until I went into the sanctuaries of God, And considered what was their end.

18. Behold! thou hast set them on slippery places; Thou castest them down into unseen pits.

19. How are they brought to desolation in a moment, And utterly consumed with sudden destruction!

20. As a dream when one awaketh, Thou, O Lord! when thou awakest, wilt make their vain show a derision.

21. When my heart was vexed And I was pierced in my reins,

22. Then was I stupid and without understanding; I was like one of the brutes before thee.

23. Yet am I ever under thy care; By my right hand thou dost hold me up.

24. Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And at last receive me in glory.

25. Whom have I in heaven but thee, And whom on earth do I love in comparison with thee?

26. Though my flesh and my heart fail, God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

27. For, lo! they who are far from thee perish; Thou destroyest all who estrange themselves from thee.

28. But it is good for me to draw near to God; I put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, That I may declare all thy works.

## Psalms 74

1. A psalm of Asaph.  O God! why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the flock of thy pasture?

2. Remember the people which thou didst purchase of old; Thine own inheritance, which thou didst redeem; That Mount Zion, where thou once didst dwell!

3. Hasten thy steps to those utter desolations! Every thing in the sanctuary hath the enemy abused!

4. Thine enemies roar in the place of thine assemblies; Their own symbols have they set up for signs.

5. They appear like those who raise the axe against a thicket;

6. They have broken down the carved work of thy temple with axes and hammers;

7. They have cast fire into thy sanctuary; They have profaned, and cast to the ground, the dwelling-place of thy name.

8. They said in their hearts, "Let us destroy them all together!" They have burned all God’s places of assembly in the land.

9. We no longer see our signs; There is no prophet among us, Nor any one that knoweth how long this desolation shall endure.

10. How long, O God! shall the adversary revile? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?

11. Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? Take it from thy bosom, and destroy!

12. Yet God was our king of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.

13. Thou didst divide the sea by thy power; Thou didst crush the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

14. Thou didst break in pieces the head of the crocodile; Thou gavest him for food to the inhabitants of the desert.

15. Thou didst cleave forth the fountain and the stream; Thou didst dry up perennial rivers.

16. Thine is the day, and thine the night; Thou didst prepare the light and the sun.

17. Thou didst establish all the boundaries of the earth; Thou didst make summer and winter.

18. O remember that the enemy hath reviled Jehovah; That an impious people hath blasphemed thy name!

19. Give not up the life of thy turtle-dove to the wild beast; Forget not for ever thine afflicted people!

20. Have regard to thy covenant! For all the dark places of the land are full of the abodes of cruelty.

21. O let not the afflicted go away ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise thy name!

22. Arise, O God! maintain thy cause! Remember how the impious revileth thee daily!

23. Forget not the clamor of thine adversaries,—The noise of thine enemies, which continually increaseth!

## Psalms 75

1. For the leader of the music. To the tune of "Do not destroy." A psalm of Asaph.  We give thanks to thee, O God! we give thanks to thee, and near is thy name; Men shall declare thy wondrous deeds!

2. "When I see my time, Then will I judge with equity.

3. The earth trembleth, and all her inhabitants; But I uphold her pillars."

4. I say to the proud, Behave not proudly! To the wicked, Lift not up your horn!

5. Lift not up your horn on high, And speak not with a stiff neck!

6. For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south;

7. But it is God that judgeth; He putteth down one, and setteth up another.

8. For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup; The wine is foaming and full of spices, And of it he poureth out; Even to the dregs shall all the wicked of the earth drink it.

9. Therefore I will extol him for ever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.

10. "I will bring down all the power of the wicked; But the righteous shall lift up their heads."

## Psalms 76

1. For the leader of the music. Upon stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph.  In Judah is God known; Great is his name in Israel.

2. In Jerusalem is his tabernacle, And in Zion his dwelling-place.

3. There brake he the lightning of the bow, The shield, the sword, and all the weapons of battle.

4. More glorious and excellent art thou Than those mountains of robbers!

5. Spoiled are the stout-hearted; They sank into their sleep; The hands of the mighty were powerless.

6. Before thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! Fell chariot and horseman into a deep sleep!

7. Thou, thou, O God! art terrible! Who can stand before thee in thine anger?

8. Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth trembled and was still,

9. When God arose to judgment, To save all the oppressed of the earth!

10. The wrath of man shall praise thee, When thou girdest on the whole of thy wrath!

11. Make and perform vows to Jehovah, your God! Let all that dwell around him bring gifts to the terrible One,

12. Who casteth down the pride of princes, Who is terrible to the kings of the earth!

## Psalms 77

1. For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites. A psalm of Asaph.  I call upon God; I cry aloud for help; I call upon God, that he would hear me!

2. In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; In the night is my hand stretched forth continually; My soul refuseth to be comforted.

3. I remember God, and am disquieted; I think of him, and my spirit is overwhelmed.

4. Thou keepest mine eyelids from closing; I am distressed, so that I cannot speak!

5. I think of the days of old,—The years of ancient times.

6. I call to remembrance my songs in the night; I meditate in my heart, And my spirit inquireth:

7. Will the Lord be angry for ever? Will he be favorable no more?

8. Is his mercy utterly withdrawn for ever? Doth his promise fail from generation to generation?

9. Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his compassion?

10. Then I say, "This is mine affliction, A change in the right hand of the Most High."

11. I remember the deeds of Jehovah; I think of thy wonders of old.

12. I meditate on all thy works, And talk of thy doings.

13. Thy ways, O God! are holy! Who so great a god as our God?

14. Thou art a God who doest wonders; Thou hast manifested thy power among the nations.

15. With thy strong arm thou didst redeem thy people,—The sons of Jacob and Joseph.

16. The waters saw thee, O God! The waters saw thee, and feared, And the deep trembled.

17. The clouds poured out water, The skies sent forth thunder, And thine arrows flew.

18. Thy thunder roared in the whirlwind; Thy lightning illumined the world; The earth trembled and shook.

19. Thy way was through the sea, And thy path through great waters; And thy footsteps could not be found.

20. Thou didst lead thy people like a flock, By the hands of Moses and Aaron.

## Psalms 78

1. A psalm of Asaph.  Give ear, O my people, to my instruction! Incline your ears to the words of my mouth!

2. I will open my mouth in a psalm; I will utter sayings of ancient times.

3. What we have heard and learned, And our fathers have told us,

4. We will not hide from their children; Showing to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, His might, and the wonders he hath wrought.

5. For he appointed statutes in Jacob, And established a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers To make known to their children;

6. So that the generation to come might know them; The children, which should be born, and rise up, Who should declare them to their children;

7. That they might put their trust in God, And not forget his deeds, But keep his commandments;

8. And might not be, like their forefathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation,—A generation whose heart was not fixed upon God, And whose spirit was not steadfast toward the Almighty.

9. The children of Ephraim were like armed bowmen, Who turn their backs in the day of battle.

10. They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;

11. And forgot his mighty deeds, And the wonders he had shown them.

12. Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; Yea, he made the waters to stand as a heap.

14. By day he led them by a cloud, And all the night by a light of fire.

15. He clave the rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink, as from the great deep.

16. From the rock he brought flowing streams, And made water to run down like rivers.

17. Yet still they sinned against him, And provoked the Most High in the desert.

18. They tempted God in their hearts, By asking food for their delight.

19. Yea, they spake against God, and said, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?

20. Behold! he smote the rock, and the water flowed, And streams gushed forth: Is he also able to give bread? Can he provide flesh for his people?"

21. When, therefore, the LORD heard this, he was wroth: So a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger arose against Israel.

22. Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his aid.

23. Yet he had commanded the clouds above, And had opened the doors of heaven;

24. And had rained down upon them manna for food, And had given them the corn of heaven.

25. Every one ate the food of princes; He sent them bread to the full.

26. Then he caused a strong wind to blow in the heavens, And by his power he brought a south wind;

27. He rained down flesh upon them as dust, And feathered fowls as the sand of the sea.

28. He caused them to fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.

29. So they did eat, and were filled; For he gave them their own desire.

30. Their desire was not yet satisfied, And their meat was yet in their mouths,

31. When the wrath of God came upon them, And slew their strong men, And smote down the chosen men of Israel.

32. For all this they sinned still, And put no trust in his wondrous works.

33. Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, And their years in sudden destruction.

34. When he slew them, they sought him; They returned, and sought earnestly for God;

35. And remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High their redeemer.

36. But they only flattered him with their mouths, And spake falsely to him with their tongues.

37. For their hearts were not true to him, Nor were they steadfast in his covenant.

38. Yet, being full of compassion, he forgave their iniquity, And would not utterly destroy them; Often he restrained his indignation, And stirred not up all his anger.

39. He remembered that they were but flesh,—A breath, that passeth and cometh not back.

40. How often did they provoke him in the wilderness! How often did they anger him in the desert!

41. Again and again they tempted God, And offended the Holy One of Israel.

42. They remembered not his hand, Nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy;

43. What signs he had wrought in Egypt, And what wonders in the fields of Zoan.

44. He turned their rivers into blood, So that they could not drink of their streams.

45. He sent amongst them flies, which devoured them, And frogs, which destroyed them.

46. He gave also their fruits to the caterpillar, And their labor to the locust.

47. He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore-trees with frost.

48. He also gave up their cattle to hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

49. He sent against them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, indignation, and woe,—A host of angels of evil.

50. He made a way for his anger, He spared them not from death, But gave up their lives to the pestilence.

51. He smote all the firstborn in Egypt; The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.

52. But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them like a flock in the wilderness.

53. He led them on safely, so that they feared not, While the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

54. He brought them to his own sacred border, Even to this mountain which his right hand had gained.

55. He cast out the nations before them, And divided their land by a measuring-line, as an inheritance, And caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

56. Yet they tempted and provoked God, the Most High, And kept not his statutes;

57. Like their fathers they were faithless, and turned back; They turned aside, like a deceitful bow.

58. They provoked his anger by their high places, And stirred up his jealousy by their graven images.

59. God saw this, and was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;

60. So that he forsook the habitation at Shiloh, The tabernacle where he dwelt among men,

61. And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the hand of the enemy.

62. His own people he gave up to the sword, And was wroth with his own inheritance.

63. Fire consumed their young men, And their maidens did not bewail them.

64. Their priests fell by the sword, And their widows made no lamentation.

65. But at length the Lord awaked as from sleep, As a hero who had been overpowered by wine;

66. He smote his enemies, and drove them back, And covered them with everlasting disgrace.

67. Yet he rejected the tents of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim;

68. But chose the tribe of Judah, The Mount Zion which he loved;

69. Where he built, like the heavens, his sanctuary; Like the earth, which he hath established for ever.

70. And he chose David, his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;

71. From tending the suckling ewes he brought him To feed Jacob his people, And Israel his inheritance.

72. He fed them with an upright heart, And guided them with skilful hands.

## Psalms 79

1. A psalm of Asaph.  O God! the nations have come into thine inheritance; They have polluted thy holy temple; They have made Jerusalem a heap of ruins!

2. They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be food for the birds of heaven, The flesh of thy holy ones to the wild beasts of the earth!

3. Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem, And there was none to bury them!

4. We have become the reproach of our neighbors,—The scorn and derision of those around us.

5. How long, O LORD! wilt thou be angry for ever? How long shall thy jealousy burn like fire?

6. Pour out thy wrath on the nations which acknowledge thee not. And on the kingdoms which call not upon thy name!

7. For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his dwelling-place.

8. O remember not against us former iniquities; Let thy tender mercy speedily succor us,

9. For we are brought very low! Help us, O God of our salvation! for the honor of thy name; F or thy name’s sake save us, and forgive our iniquities!

10. Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" May the revenging of the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed, Be manifested among the nations before our eyes!

11. Let the cry of the prisoner come before thee! According to the greatness of thy power preserve those that are appointed to die!

12. And return sevenfold into our neighbors’ bosoms The reproach with which they have reproached thee, O Lord!

13. So shall we, thy people, and the flock of thy pasture, Give thanks to thee for ever. And show forth thy praise to all generations.

## Psalms 80

1. For the leader of the music. Upon the Shushan-Eduth. A psalm of Asaph.  Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel! Thou who leadest Joseph like a flock, Thou who sittest between the cherubs, shine forth!

2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy strength, And come and save us!

3. Bring us back, O God! And cause thy face to shine, that we may be saved!

4. O LORD, God of hosts! How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?

5. For thou causest them to eat the bread of tears, And givest them tears to drink, in full measure.

6. Thou hast made us the object of strife to our neighbors, And our enemies hold us in derision.

7. Bring us back, O God of hosts! And cause thy face to shine that we may be saved!

8. Thou didst bring a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst expel the nations, and plant it.

9. Thou didst prepare a place for it; It spread its roots, and filled the land.

10. The mountains were covered with its shade, And its branches were like the cedars of God.

11. It sent out its boughs to the sea, And its branches to the river.

12. Why hast thou now broken down its hedges, So that all who pass by do pluck from it?

13. The boar from the wood doth waste it, And the wild beast of the forest doth devour it.

14. O God of hosts! return, we beseech thee, Look down from heaven, and behold, And have regard to this vine!

15. Protect what thy right hand planted; The branch which thou madest strong for thyself!

16. It is burnt with fire; it is cut down; Under thy rebuke they perish.

17. May thy hand be over the man of thy right hand, The man whom thou madest strong for thyself!

18. So will we no more turn back from thee: Revive us, and upon thy name alone will we call!

19. Bring us back, O LORD, God of hosts! And cause thy face to shine, that we may he saved!

## Psalms 81

1. For the leader of the music. On the Gittith. A psalm of Asaph.  Sing joyfully to God, our strength! Shout with gladness to the God of Jacob!

2. Raise a song, and strike the timbrel, The sweet-sounding harp, and the psaltery!

3. Blow the trumpet at the new moon; At the full moon, also, on our festal day!

4. For this is a statute for Israel, A law of the God of Jacob;

5. He appointed it as a memorial in Joseph, When he went out of the land of Egypt, Where he heard a language which he knew not.

6. "I relieved [said he] thy shoulders from their burden; Thy hands were removed from the hod.

7. Thou didst call in trouble, and I delivered thee; In the secret place of thunder I answered thee; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. [Pause.]

8. Hear, O my people! and I will admonish thee! O Israel! that thou wouldst hearken to me!

9. Let there be no strange god within thee, Nor worship thou any foreign god!

10. I Jehovah am thy God, Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: Open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it!

11. But my people would not listen to my voice, And Israel would not hearken to me.

12. So I gave them up to the obstinacy of their hearts, And they walked according to their own devices.

13. "O that my people had hearkened to me! That Israel had walked in my ways!

14. Soon would I have brought low their enemies, And turned my hand against their adversaries.

15. The haters of Jehovah should have become suppliants to them, And their prosperity should have endured for ever.

16. With the finest of the wheat I would have fed them, And with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied them."

## Psalms 82

1. A psalm of Asaph.  God standeth in God’s assembly, He judgeth in the midst of the gods.

2. "How long will ye judge unjustly, And favor the cause of the wicked? [Pause.]

3. Defend the poor and the fatherless; Do justice to the wretched and the needy!

4. Deliver the poor and the destitute; Save them from the hand of the wicked!

5. They are without knowledge and without understanding; They walk in darkness: Therefore all the foundations of the land are shaken.

6. I have said, Ye are gods, And all of you children of the Most High;

7. But ye shall die like men, And fall like the rest of the princes."

8. Arise, O God! judge the earth! For all the nations are thy possession.

## Psalms 83

1. A psalm of Asaph.  O God! keep not silence! Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God!

2. For, lo! thine enemies roar, And they who hate thee lift up their heads.

3. For they form secret plots against thy people, And consult together against thy chosen ones.

4. "Come," say they, "let us blot them out from the number of the nations, That the name of Israel may no more be remembered!"

5. With one consent they consult together, Against thee do they form a league,—

6. The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Of Moab and the Hagarenes,

7. Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, The Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.

8. The Assyrians also are joined with them; They lend their strength to the children of Lot.

9. Do to them as to the Midianites, As to Sisera, as to Jabin at the brook Kison,

10. Who perished at Endor, And were trampled like dung to the earth.

11. Make their chiefs like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes as Zeba and Zalmunna!

12. Who say, "Let us seize on God’s habitations!"

13. Make them, O my God! like whirling chaff; Like stubble before the wind!

14. As fire consumeth the forest, And as flame setteth the mountains in a blaze,

15. So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm!

16. Cover their faces with shame, That they may seek thy name, O LORD!

17. Let them be confounded! Yea, let them be put to shame, and perish!

18. That they may know that thy name alone is Jehovah; That thou art the Most High over all the earth.

## Psalms 84

1. For the leader of the music. On the Gittith. A psalm of the sons of Korah.  How lovely are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

2. My soul longeth, yea, fainteth, for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh cry aloud for the living God.

3. The very sparrow findeth an abode, And the swallow a nest, where they may lay their young, By thine altars, O LORD of hosts, My king and my God!

4. Happy they who dwell in thy house, Who are continually praising thee! [Pause.]

5. Happy the man whose glory is in thee, In whose heart are the ways [to Jerusalem]!

6. Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a fountain; and the early rain covereth it with blessings.

7. They go on from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.

8. Hear my prayer, O LORD, God of hosts! Give ear, O God of Jacob! [Pause.]

9. Look down, O God! our shield, And behold the face of thine anointed!

10. For a day spent in thy courts is better than a thousand: I would rather stand on the threshold of the house of my God, Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; The LORD giveth grace and glory; No good thing doth he withhold From them that walk uprightly.

12. O LORD of hosts! Happy the man who trusteth in thee!

## Psalms 85

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.  O LORD! thou hast been favorable to thy land; Thou hast brought back the captives of Jacob;

2. Thou didst forgive the iniquity of thy people, And cover all their sins! [Pause.]

3. Thou didst take away all thy displeasure, And abate the fierceness of thy wrath.

4. Restore us, O God of our salvation! And let thine anger towards us cease!

5. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation?

6. Wilt thou not revive us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?

7. Show us thy compassion, O LORD! And grant us thy salvation!

8. I will hear what God the LORD will speak: Truly he will speak peace to his people, and to his servants; Only let them not turn again to folly!

9. Yea, his salvation is near to those who fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.

10. Mercy and truth shall meet together, Righteousness and peace shall kiss each other;

11. Truth shall spring out of the earth; Righteousness shall look down from heaven.

12. Yea, Jehovah will give prosperity, And our land shall yield her increase.

13. Righteousness shall go before him, And set us in the way of his steps.

## Psalms 86

1. A prayer of David.  Incline thine ear, O LORD! and hear me, For I am poor and distressed!

2. Preserve my life, for I am devoted to thee! Save, O thou my God! thy servant who trusteth in thee!

3. Have pity upon me, O Lord! For to thee do I cry daily!

4. Revive the soul of thy servant, For to thee, O Lord! do I lift up my soul!

5. For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; Yea, rich in mercy to all that call upon thee!

6. Give ear, O LORD! to my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplication!

7. In the day of my trouble I call upon thee, For thou dost answer me!

8. Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lord! And there are no works like thy works!

9. All the nations which thou hast made must come and worship before thee, O Lord! And glorify thy name!

10. For great art thou, and wondrous are thy works; Thou alone art God!

11. Teach me, O LORD! thy way, That I may walk in thy truth; Unite all my heart to fear thy name!

12. I will praise thee, O Lord, my God! with my whole heart; I will give glory to thy name for ever!

13. For thy kindness to me hath been great; Thou hast delivered me from the depths of the underworld!

14. O God! the proud have risen against me; Bands of cruel men seek my life, And set not thee before their eyes.

15. But thou, O Lord! art a God full of compassion and kindness, Long-suffering, rich in mercy and truth!

16. Look upon me, and have compassion upon me! Give thy strength to thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid!

17. Show me a token for good, That my enemies may see it and be confounded; Because thou, O LORD! helpest and comfortest me!

## Psalms 87

1. A psalm of the sons of Korah.  His foundation is in the holy mountains;

2. Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.

3. Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God! [Pause.]

4. "I name Egypt and Babylon among them that know me; Behold! Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia,—They also were born there."

5. And of Zion it shall be said, "Men of every nation were born there, And the Most High hath established her."

6. Jehovah, when he numbereth the nations, shall write, "These were born there!" [Pause.]

7. Singers as well as dancers,—All my springs are in thee!

## Psalms 88

1. A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the leader of the music. Upon wind instruments. A psalm of Heman, the Ezrahite.  O LORD, God of my salvation! To thee do I cry by day, And by night is my prayer before thee!

2. Let my supplication come before thee; Incline thine ear to my cry!

3. For my soul is full of misery, And my life draweth near to the underworld.

4. I am counted with those who are going down to the pit; I am like one who hath no strength.

5. I am left to myself among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom thou no more rememberest, And who are cut off from thy [protecting] hand.

6. Thou hast placed me in a deep pit, In a dark and deep abyss.

7. Thy wrath presseth hard upon me, And thou afflictest me with all thy waves! [Pause.]

8. Thou hast put mine acquaintances far from me, Yea, thou hast made me their abhorrence: I am shut up, and cannot go forth.

9. Mine eyes languish by reason of my affliction. I call upon thee daily, O LORD! To thee do I stretch out my hands!

10. Canst thou show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise, and praise thee? [Pause.]

11. Shall thy goodness be declared in the grave, Or thy faithfulness in the place of corruption?

12. Shall thy wonders be known in the dark, And thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?

13. To thee do I cry, O LORD! In the morning doth my cry come before thee.

14. Why, O LORD! dost thou cast me off? Why hidest thou thy face from me?

15. I have been afflicted and languishing from my youth; I suffer thy terrors, and am distracted.

16. Thy fierce wrath overwhelmeth me; Thy terrors utterly destroy me.

17. They surround me daily like water; They compass me about together.

18. Lover and friend hast thou put far from me; My acquaintances are withdrawn from my sight.

## Psalms 89

1. A psalm of Ethan, the Ezrahite.  I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever; With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations!

2. For I know that thy mercy endureth for ever; Thou hast established thy truth like the heavens.

3. "I have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn to David, my servant:

4. Thy family I will establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations." [Pause.]

5. The heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD! And the assembly of the holy ones thy truth!

6. Who in the heavens can be compared to Jehovah? Who is like Jehovah among the sons of God?

7. A God greatly to be feared in the assembly of the holy ones, And to be had in reverence above all who are around him?

8. O Jehovah, God of hosts! Who is mighty like thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.

9. Thou rulest the raging of the sea; When the waves thereof rise, thou stillest them!

10. Thou didst break Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou didst scatter thine enemies with thy mighty arm.

11. The heavens are thine; thine also is the earth; The world and all that is therein, thou didst found them.

12. The North and the South were created by thee; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.

13. Thine is a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high thy right hand.

14. Justice and equity are the foundation of thy throne; Mercy and truth go before thy face.

15. Happy the people that know the trumpet’s sound! They walk, O LORD! in the light of thy countenance;

16. In thy name they daily rejoice, And in thy righteousness they glory!

17. For thou art the glory of their strength; Yea, through thy favor our horn exalteth itself!

18. For from Jehovah is our shield, And from the Holy One of Israel is our king.

19. Once thou spakest in a vision to thy holy one, And saidst,—"I have laid help on one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people;

20. I have found David, my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him.

21. With him shall my hand be established, And my arm shall strengthen him.

22. The enemy shall not have power over him, Nor shall the unrighteous man oppress him.

23. For I will beat down his foes before him, And overthrow them that hate him.

24. My faithfulness and mercy shall be with him, And through my name shall his horn be exalted.

25. I will extend his hand to the sea, And his right hand to the rivers.

26. He shall say to me, ‘Thou art my father, My God, and the rock of my salvation!’

27. I will also make him my first-born, Highest of the kings of the earth.

28. My mercy I will continue to him for ever; My covenant with him shall be steadfast.

29. I will make his family to endure for ever; And his throne shall be as lasting as the heavens.

30. Should his children forsake my law, And walk not in my statutes,

31. Should they break my commandments, And observe not my precepts,

32. I will punish their transgressions with a rod, And their iniquity with stripes.

33. But my kindness will I not withdraw from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

34. I will not break my covenant, Nor alter what hath gone from my lips.

35. Once have I sworn in my holiness, That I will not be false unto David.

36. His family shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before me.

37. It shall be established for ever like the moon; Like the faithful witness in the sky."

38. But now thou forsakest and abhorrest, And art angry with, thine anointed.

39. Thou hast made void the covenant with thy servant; Thou hast cast his crown to the ground.

40. Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.

41. All who pass by plunder him; He is a reproach to his neighbors.

42. Thou hast lifted up the right hand of his enemies; Thou hast made all his adversaries to rejoice.

43. Yea, thou hast turned the edge of his sword, And made him unable to stand in battle.

44. Thou hast brought his glory to an end, And hast cast down his throne to the ground.

45. Thou hast shortened the days of his youth; Thou hast covered him with shame.

46. How long, O LORD! wilt thou hide thyself for ever? How long shall thine anger burn like fire?

47. Remember how short is my life, To what frailty thou hast created all men!

48. What man liveth, and seeth not death? Who can deliver himself from the underworld?

49. Where, Lord, is thy former loving-kindness Which thou didst swear to David in thy truth?

50. Remember, O Lord! the reproach of thy servants, How I bear in my bosom the taunts of all the many nations,

51. With which thine enemies have reproached me, O LORD! With which they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed!

52. Praised be Jehovah for ever! Amen, yea, amen!

## Psalms 90

1. BOOK IV. A prayer of Moses, the man of God.  LORD! thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations!

2. Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God!

3. But man thou turnest again to dust, And sayst, "Return, ye children of men!"

4. For a thousand years are, in thy sight, As yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.

5. Thou carriest him away as with a flood; He is a dream; In the morning he springeth up like grass,

6. Which flourisheth and shooteth up in the morning, And in the evening is cut down, and withered.

7. For we are consumed by thine anger, And by thy wrath are we destroyed.

8. Thou settest our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.

9. By reason of thine anger all our days vanish away; We spend our years like a thought.

10. The days of our life are threescore years and ten, And, by reason of strength, may be fourscore years: Yet is the pride of them weariness and sorrow; For it vanisheth swiftly, and we fly away.

11. Yet who attendeth to the power of thine anger? Who with due reverence regardeth thine indignation?

12. Teach us so to number our days, That we may apply our hearts to wisdom!

13. Desist, O LORD! How long—? Have compassion upon thy servants!

14. Satisfy us speedily with thy mercy, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days!

15. Make us glad according to the time in which thou hast afflicted us; According to the years in which we have seen adversity!

16. Let thy deeds be known to thy servants, And thy glory to their children!

17. Let the favor of the LORD our God be upon us, And establish for us the work of our hands; Yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it!

## Psalms 91

1. He who sitteth under the shelter of the Most High Maketh his abode in the shadow of the Almighty.

2. I say to the LORD, Thou art my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust.

3. Surely he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the wasting pestilence;

4. He will cover thee with his feathers, And under his wings shalt thou find refuge; His faithfulness shall be thy shield and buckler.

5. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night, Nor of the arrow that flieth by day;

6. Nor of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor of the plague that destroyeth at noonday.

7. A thousand shall fall by thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But thee it shall not touch.

8. Thou shalt only behold with thine eyes, And see the recompense of the wicked.

9. Because thou hast made the LORD thy refuge, And the Most High thy habitation,

10. No evil shall befall thee, Nor any plague come near thy dwelling.

11. For he will give his angels charge over thee, To guard thee in all thy ways.

12. They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

13. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.

14. "Because he loveth me, I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name.

15. When he calleth upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honor.

16. With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation."

## Psalms 92

1. A psalm for the Sabbath-day.  It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, And to sing praises to thy name, O Most High!

2. To show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,

3. Upon the ten-stringed instrument and the lute, Upon the harp with a solemn sound.

4. For thou, LORD, hast made me glad by thy doings; In the works of thy hands I greatly rejoice!

5. How great are thy works, O LORD! How deep thy purposes!

6. But the unwise man knoweth not this, And the fool understandeth it not.

7. When the wicked spring up like grass, And all who practise iniquity flourish, It is but to be destroyed for ever!

8. Thou, O LORD! art for ever exalted!

9. For, lo! thine enemies, O LORD! For, lo! thine enemies perish, And dispersed are all who do iniquity!

10. But my horn thou exaltest like the buffalo’s; I am anointed with fresh oil.

11. Mine eye hath gazed with joy upon mine enemies; Mine ears have heard with joy of my wicked adversaries.

12. The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; They shall grow up like the cedars of Lebanon;

13. Planted in the house of the LORD, They shall flourish in the courts of our God.

14. Even in old age they bring forth fruit; They are green, and full of sap;

15. To show that the LORD, my rock, is upright, That there is no unrighteousness in him.

## Psalms 93

1. Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with majesty, and girded with strength; Therefore the earth standeth firm, and cannot be moved.

2. Thy throne was established of old; Thou art from everlasting!

3. The floods, O LORD! lift up, The floods lift up their voice; The floods lift up their roaring!

4. Mightier than the voice of many waters, Yea, than the mighty waves of the sea, Is the LORD in his lofty habitation.

5. Thy promises are most sure; Holiness becometh thy house, O LORD! for ever!

## Psalms 94

1. O LORD! thou God of vengeance! O thou God of vengeance! shine forth!

2. Rouse thyself, thou judge of the earth! Render a recompense to the proud!

3. How long, O LORD! shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?

4. How long shall their lips pour forth insolence? How long shall all the evil-doers boast?

5. O LORD! they trample upon thy people, And oppress thine inheritance!

6. They slay the widow, and the stranger, And murder the fatherless;

7. And they say, "The LORD doth not see, The God of Jacob doth not regard!"

8. Be instructed, ye most stupid of mankind! O when, ye fools, will ye be wise?

9. He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?

10. He that chastiseth nations, shall not he punish? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

11. The LORD knoweth the thoughts of men, That they are vanity.

12. Happy the man, O LORD! whom thou correctest, Whom by thy teaching thou makest wise;

13. To give him peace in the days of adversity, Until a pit be digged for the wicked!

14. For the LORD will not forsake his people, Nor abandon his own inheritance.

15. For judgment shall return to justice, And all the upright in heart shall follow it.

16. Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evil-doers?

17. If the LORD had not been my help, I had well nigh dwelt in the land of silence.

18. When I think that my foot is slipping, Thy goodness, O LORD! holdeth me up.

19. In the multitude of anxieties within me, Thy consolations revive my soul.

20. Shall with thee be allied the throne of iniquity, Which deviseth mischief against law?

21. They band together against the life of the righteous, And condemn innocent blood.

22. But the LORD is my fortress, And my God the rock of my refuge.

23. He will bring upon them their own iniquity; Yea, through their own wickedness he will cut them off; Yea, the LORD, our God, will cut them off.

## Psalms 95

1. O come, let us sing to the LORD; Let us raise a voice of joy to the rock of our salvation!

2. Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving, And sing joyfully to him with psalms!

3. For Jehovah is a great God; Yea, a great king over all gods.

4. In his hands are the depths of the earth; His also are the heights of the mountains.

5. The sea is his, and he made it; The dry land also his hands formed.

6. O come, let us worship and bow down! Let us kneel before the LORD, our maker!

7. For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture and the flock of his hand. O that ye would now hear his voice!

8. "Harden not your hearts as at Meribah [the strife], As in the day of temptation [Massah] in the wilderness,

9. Where your fathers tempted me And tried me, although they had seen my works.

10. Forty years was I offended with that generation: And I said, ‘They are a people of a perverse heart, And who have no regard to my ways.’

11. Therefore I sware, in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest."

## Psalms 96

1. O sing to Jehovah a new song; Sing to Jehovah, all the earth!

2. Sing to Jehovah; praise his name, Show forth his salvation from day to day!

3. Proclaim his glory among the nations, His wonders among all people!

4. For Jehovah is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.

5. For all the gods of the nations are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.

6. Honor and majesty are before him; Glory and beauty are in his holy abode.

7. Give to Jehovah, ye tribes of the people, Give to Jehovah glory and praise!

8. Give to Jehovah the glory due to his name; Bring an offering, and come into his courts!

9. O worship Jehovah in holy attire! Tremble before him, all the earth!

10. Say among the nations, Jehovah is king; The world shall stand firm; it shall not be moved; He will judge the nations in righteousness.

11. Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;

12. Let the fields be joyful, with all that is therein; Let all the trees of the forest rejoice

13. Before Jehovah! for he cometh, He cometh to judge the earth! He will judge the world with justice, And the nations with faithfulness.

## Psalms 97

1. The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of isles be glad!

2. Clouds and darkness are round about him; Justice and equity are the foundation of his throne.

3. Before him goeth a fire, Which burneth up his enemies around.

4. His lightnings illumine the world; The earth beholdeth and trembleth.

5. The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

6. The heavens declare his righteousness, And all nations behold his glory.

7. Confounded be they who worship graven images, Who glory in idols! To him, all ye gods, bow down!

8. Zion hath heard, and is glad, And the daughters of Judah exult On account of thy judgments, O LORD!

9. For thou, O LORD! art most high above all the earth; Thou art far exalted above all gods!

10. Ye that love the LORD, hate evil! He preserveth the lives of his servants, And delivereth them from the hand of the wicked.

11. Light is sown for the righteous, And joy for the upright in heart.

12. Rejoice, O ye righteous, in the LORD, And praise his holy name!

## Psalms 98

1. A psalm.  Sing to the LORD a new song; For he hath done marvellous things; His own right hand and his holy arm have gotten him the victory!

2. The LORD hath made known his salvation; His righteousness hath he manifested in the sight of the nations.

3. He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel, And all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

4. Shout unto the LORD, all the earth! Break forth into joy, and exult, and sing!

5. Sing to the LORD with the harp, With the harp, and the voice of song!

6. With clarions, and the sound of trumpets, Make a joyful noise before the LORD the King!

7. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein;

8. Let the rivers clap their hands, And the mountains rejoice together

9. Before the LORD! for he cometh to judge the earth! With righteousness will he judge the world, And the nations with equity.

## Psalms 99

1. The LORD reigneth, let the nations tremble! He sitteth between the cherubs, let the earth quake!

2. Great is the LORD upon Zion; He is exalted over all the nations.

3. Let men praise thy great and terrible name! It is holy.

4. Let them declare the glory of the King who loveth justice! Thou hast established equity; Thou dost execute justice in Jacob!

5. Exalt ye Jehovah, our God, And bow yourselves down at his footstool! He is holy.

6. Moses and Aaron, with his priests, And Samuel, who called upon his name,—They called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

7. He spake to them in the cloudy pillar; They kept his commandments, And the ordinances which he gave them.

8. Thou, O LORD, our God! didst answer them; Thou wast to them a forgiving God, Though thou didst punish their transgressions!

9. Exalt the LORD, our God. And worship at his holy mountain! For the LORD, our God, is holy.

## Psalms 100

1. A psalm of praise.  Raise a voice of joy unto the LORD, all ye lands!

2. Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before his presence with rejoicing!

3. Know ye that Jehovah is God! It is he that made us, and we are his, His people, and the flock of his pasture.

4. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And his courts with praise; Be thankful to him, and bless his name!

5. For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; And his truth endureth to all generations.

## Psalms 101

1. A psalm of David.  I will sing of mercy and justice; To thee, O LORD! will I sing!

2. I will have regard to the way of uprightness: When thou shalt come to me, I will walk within my house with an upright heart.

3. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes; I hate the work of evil-doers; It shall not cleave to me.

4. The perverse in heart shall be far from me; I will not know a wicked person.

5. Whoso slandereth his neighbor in secret, him will I cut off; Him that hath a haughty look and a proud heart I will not endure.

6. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; He that walketh in the way of uprightness shall serve me.

7. He who practiseth deceit shall not dwell in my house; He who telleth lies shall not remain in my sight.

8. Every morning will I destroy the wicked of the land, That I may cut off all evil-doers from the city of the LORD.

## Psalms 102

1. A prayer of the afflicted, when in deep distress he poureth out his complaint before the Lord.  Hear my prayer, O LORD! And let my cry come unto thee!

2. Hide not thy face from me in the day of my trouble; Incline thine ear to me when I call! Answer me speedily!

3. For my life is consumed like smoke, And my bones burn like a brand.

4. My heart is smitten and withered like grass; Yea, I forget to eat my bread.

5. By reason of my sighing, my bones cleave to my skin;

6. I am like the pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl amid ruins.

7. I am sleepless; I am like a solitary bird upon the house-top.

8. All the day long my enemies reproach me; They who rage against me curse by me.

9. For I eat ashes like bread, And mingle my drink with tears.

10. On account of thine indignation and thy wrath; For thou hast lifted me up and cast me down!

11. My life is like a declining shadow, And I wither like grass.

12. But thou, O LORD! endurest for ever, And thy name from generation to generation!

13. Thou wilt arise and have pity upon Zion, For the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come.

14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones; Yea, they have a regard for her dust.

15. Then shall the nations fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.

16. For Jehovah will build up Zion; He will appear in his glory.

17. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, And not despise their supplication.

18. This shall be written for the generation to come, That the people to be born may praise Jehovah.

19. For he looketh down from his holy height, From heaven doth he cast his eye upon the earth,

20. To listen to the sighs of the prisoner. To release those that are doomed to death;

21. That they may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem,

22. When the nations are assembled together, And the kingdoms to serve Jehovah.

23. He hath weakened my strength on the way, He hath shortened my days.

24. I say, O my God! take me not away in the midst of my days! Thy years endure through all generations.

25. Of old hast thou laid the foundations of the earth, And the heavens are the work of thy hands;

26. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, And they shall be changed;

27. But thou art the same, And thy years have no end.

28. The children of thy servants shall dwell securely, And their posterity shall be established before thee.

## Psalms 103

1. A psalm of David.  Bless the LORD, O my soul! And all that is within me, bless his holy name!

2. Bless the LORD, O my soul! And forget not all his benefits!

3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;

4. Who redeemeth thy life from the grave; Who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;

5. Who satisfieth thine old age with good, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.

6. The LORD executeth justice And equity for all the oppressed.

7. He made known his ways to Moses, His doings to the children of Israel.

8. The LORD is merciful and kind, Slow to anger and rich in mercy.

9. He doth not always chide, Nor doth he keep his anger for ever.

10. He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor requited us according to our iniquities.

11. As high as are the heavens above the earth, So great is his mercy to them that fear him.

12. As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.

13. Even as a father pitieth his children, So the LORD pitieth them that fear him.

14. For he knoweth our frame, He remembereth that we are dust.

15. As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

16. The wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And its place shall know it no more.

17. But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting to them that fear him, And his righteousness to children’s children,

18. To such as keep his covenant, And remember his commandments to do them.

19. The LORD hath established his throne in the heavens, And his kingdom ruleth over all.

20. Bless the LORD, ye his angels, Ye mighty ones who do his commands, Hearkening to the voice of his word!

21. Bless the LORD, all ye his hosts; Ye, his ministers, who do his pleasure!

22. Bless the LORD, all his works, In all places of his dominion! Bless the LORD, O my soul!

## Psalms 104

1. Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD, my God! thou art very great! Thou art clothed with glory and majesty!

2. He covereth himself with light as with a garment; He spreadeth out the heavens like a curtain;

3. He layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; He maketh the clouds his chariot; He rideth upon the wings of the wind.

4. He maketh the winds his messengers, The flaming lightnings his ministers.

5. He established the earth on its foundations; It shall not be removed for ever.

6. Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a garment; The waters stood above the mountains!

7. At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.

8. The mountains rose, the valleys sank, In the place which thou didst appoint for them.

9. Thou hast established a bound which the waters may not pass, That they may not return, and cover the earth.

10. He sendeth forth the springs in brooks; They run among the mountains;

11. They give drink to all the beasts of the forest; In them the wild asses quench their thirst.

12. About them the birds of heaven have their habitation; They sing among the branches.

13. He watereth the hills from his chambers; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works!

14. He causeth grass to spring up for cattle, And herbage for the service of man, To bring forth food out of the earth,

15. And wine that gladdeneth the heart of man, Making his face to shine more than oil, And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart.

16. The trees of the LORD are full of sap, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

17. There the birds build their nests; In the cypresses the stork hath her abode.

18. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, And the rocks for the conies.

19. He appointed the moon to mark seasons; The sun knoweth when to go down.

20. Thou makest darkness, and it is night, When all the beasts of the forest go forth!

21. The young lions roar for prey, And seek their food from God.

22. When the sun ariseth, they withdraw themselves, And lie down in their dens.

23. Man goeth forth to his work, And to his labor, until the evening.

24. O LORD! how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all! The earth is full of thy riches!

25. Lo! this great and wide sea! In it are moving creatures without number, Animals small and great.

26. There go the ships; There is the leviathan, which thou hast made to play therein.

27. All these wait on thee To give them their food in due season.

28. Thou givest it to them, they gather it; Thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good.

29. Thou hidest thy face, they are confounded; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to the dust.

30. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created, And thou renewest the face of the earth.

31. The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever; The LORD shall rejoice in his works;

32. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the hills, and they smoke.

33. I will sing to the LORD as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

34. May my meditation be acceptable to him! I will rejoice in the LORD.

35. May sinners perish from the earth, And the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise ye the LORD!

## Psalms 105

1. O give thanks unto the LORD; Call upon his name; Make known his deeds among the people!

2. Sing unto him; sing psalms unto him; Tell ye of all his wondrous works!

3. Glory ye in his holy name; Let the hearts of them that seek the LORD rejoice!

4. Seek the LORD, and his majesty; Seek his face continually!

5. Remember the wonders he hath wrought, His miracles and the judgments of his mouth,

6. Ye offspring of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob his chosen!

7. Jehovah, he is our God, His judgments are over all the earth.

8. He remembereth his covenant for ever, And the promise to a thousand generations;

9. The covenant which he made with Abraham, And the oath which he gave to Isaac;

10. Which he confirmed to Jacob for a decree, And to Israel for an everlasting covenant.

11. "To thee," said he, "will I give the land of Canaan For the lot of your inheritance."

12. When they were yet few in number, Very few, and strangers in the land;

13. When they went from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people,

14. He suffered no man to oppress them; Yea, he rebuked kings for their sakes.

15. "Touch not," said he, "mine anointed, And do my prophets no harm!"

16. Again, when he commanded a famine in the land, And broke the whole staff of bread,

17. He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold as a slave.

18. His feet they hurt with fetters; He was bound in chains of iron;

19. Until his prediction came to pass, And the word of the LORD proved him.

20. Then the king sent, and loosed him; The ruler of nations, and set him free;

21. He made him governor of his house, And lord of all his possessions;

22. To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his counsellors wisdom.

23. Israel also came into Egypt, And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham;

24. Where God increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their enemies.

25. He turned their hearts to hate his people, And form devices against his servants.

26. Then sent he Moses his servant, And Aaron, whom he had chosen.

27. They showed his signs among them, And his wonders in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness upon them, and made it dark; And they did not disobey his word.

29. He turned their waters into blood, And caused their fish to die.

30. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, Even in the chambers of their kings.

31. He spake, and there came flies, And lice in all their coasts.

32. Instead of rain he gave them hail, And flaming fire in their land.

33. He smote also their vines and fig-trees, And broke the trees of their coasts.

34. He spake, and the locusts came. Destructive locusts without number,

35. Which ate up all the herbage in their land, And devoured the fruits of their fields.

36. Then he smote all the first-born in their land, The first-fruits of all their strength.

37. He led forth his people with silver and gold; Nor was there one feeble person in all their tribes.

38. Egypt was glad when they departed, For their terror had fallen upon them.

39. He spread out a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light by night.

40. They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed forth, And ran in the dry places like a river.

42. For he remembered his holy promise, Which he had made to Abraham his servant;

43. And he led forth his people with joy, And his chosen with gladness.

44. He gave to them the lands of the nations, And they inherited the labor of the peoples;

45. That they might observe his statutes, And obey his laws. Praise ye the LORD!

## Psalms 106

1. Praise ye the LORD! O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; For his mercy endureth for ever!

2. Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD? Who can show forth all his praise?

3. Happy are they who have regard to justice, Who practise righteousness at all times!

4. Remember me, O LORD! with the favor promised to thy people; O visit me with thy salvation!

5. That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the joy of thy people, That I may glory with thine inheritance!

6. We have sinned with our fathers; We have committed iniquity; we have done wickedly.

7. Our fathers in Egypt did not regard thy wonders; They remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; But rebelled at the sea, the Red sea.

8. Yet he saved them for his own name’s sake. That he might make his mighty power to be known.

9. He rebuked the Red sea, and it was dried up, And he led them through the deep as through a desert.

10. He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

11. The waters covered their enemies; There was not one of them left.

12. Then believed they his words, And sang his praise.

13. But they soon forgot his deeds, And waited not for his counsel.

14. They gave way to appetite in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert;

15. And he gave them their request, But sent upon them leanness.

16. They also envied Moses in the camp, And Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.

17. Then the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram,

18. And a fire was kindled in their company; The flames burned up the wicked.

19. They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image;

20. They changed their God of glory Into the image of a grass-eating ox.

21. They forgot God, their saviour, Who had done such great things in Egypt,

22. Such wonders in the land of Ham. Such terrible things at the Red sea.

23. Then he said that he would destroy them; Had not Moses, his chosen, stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, that he might not destroy them.

24. They also despised the pleasant land, And believed not his word;

25. But murmured in their tents, And would not hearken to the voice of the LORD.

26. Then he lifted up his hand against them, And swore that he would make them fall in the wilderness;

27. That he would overthrow their descendants among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.

28. They also gave themselves to the worship of Baal-peor, And ate sacrifices offered to lifeless idols.

29. Thus they provoked his anger by their practices, And a plague broke in upon them.

30. Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment, And the plague was stayed.

31. And this was counted to him for righteousness, To all generations for ever.

32. They provoked him also at the waters of Meribah [strife], And evil befell Moses on their account.

33. For they provoked his spirit, So that he spake inconsiderately with his lips.

34. They did not destroy the nations, As Jehovah had commanded them.

35. They mingled themselves with the peoples, And learned their practices.

36. They even worshipped their idols, Which became to them a snare.

37. Their sons and their daughters they sacrificed to demons,

38. And shed innocent blood, The blood of their own sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.

39. Thus they defiled themselves with their works, And played the harlot with their practices.

40. Then burned the anger of the LORD against his people, So that he abhorred his own inheritance.

41. And he gave them into the hand of the nations, And they who hated them ruled over them.

42. Their enemies oppressed them, And they were bowed down under their hand.

43. Many times did he deliver them; But they provoked him by their devices, And they were brought low for their iniquities.

44. Yet, when he heard their cries, He had regard to their affliction;

45. He remembered his covenant with them, And repented according to the greatness of his mercy,

46. And caused them to find pity Among all that carried them captive.

47. Save us, O Jehovah, our God! and gather us from among the nations, That we may give thanks to thy holy name, And glory in thy praise!

48. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, Amen! Praise ye Jehovah!

## Psalms 107

1. BOOK V.  O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; For his mercy endureth for ever!

2. Let the redeemed of the LORD say it, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;

3. Whom he hath gathered from the lands, From the east, the west, the north, and the south.

4. They were wandering in the wilderness, in a desert, They found no way to a city to dwell in.

5. They were hungry and thirsty, And their souls fainted within them.

6. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distress.

7. He led them in a straight way, Till they came to a city where they might dwell.

8. O let them praise the LORD for his goodness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!

9. For he satisfieth the thirsty, And the hungry he filleth with good.

10. They dwelt in darkness and the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron;

11. Because they disobeyed the commands of God, And contemned the will of the Most High;

12. Their hearts he brought down by hardship; They fell down, and there was none to help.

13. But they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses;

14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bands asunder.

15. O let them praise the LORD for his goodness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!

16. For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron asunder.

17. The foolish, because of their transgressions, And because of their iniquities, were afflicted;

18. They abhorred all kinds of food; They were near to the gates of death.

19. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses;

20. He sent his word, and healed them, And saved them from their destruction.

21. O let them praise the LORD for his goodness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!

22. Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with joy!

23. They who go down to the sea in ships, And do business in great waters,

24. These see the works of the LORD, And his wonders in the deep.

25. He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth high the waves.

26. They mount up to the heavens, They sink down to the depths, Their soul melteth with distress;

27. They reel and stagger like a drunken man, And all their skill is vain.

28. Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses;

29. He turneth the storm into a calm, And the waves are hushed;

30. Then they rejoice that they are still, And he bringeth them to their desired haven.

31. O let them praise the LORD for his goodness. For his wonderful works to the children of men!

32. Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, And praise him in the assembly of the elders!

33. He turneth rivers into a desert, And springs of water into dry ground;

34. A fruitful land into barrenness, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

35. He turneth the desert into a lake of water, And dry ground into springs of water;

36. And there he causeth the hungry to dwell, And they build a city for a dwelling-place,

37. And sow fields and plant vineyards, Which yield a fruitful increase.

38. He blesseth them, so that they multiply greatly, And suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

39. When they are diminished and brought low By oppression, affliction, and sorrow,

40. He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in a pathless wilderness;

41. But he raiseth the poor from their affliction, And increaseth their families like a flock.

42. The righteous see it and rejoice, And all iniquity shutteth her mouth.

43. Whoso is wise, let him observe this, And have regard to the loving-kindness of the LORD!

## Psalms 108

1. A psalm of David.  O God! my heart is strengthened! I will sing and give thanks.

2. Awake, my soul! awake, my psaltery and harp! I will wake with the early dawn.

3. I will praise thee, O LORD! among the nations; I will sing to thee among the peoples!

4. For thy mercy reacheth to the heavens, And thy truth above the clouds.

5. Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth!

6. That thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer me!

7. God promiseth in his holiness; I will rejoice; I shall yet divide Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth;

8. Gilead shall be mine, and mine Manasseh; Ephraim shall be my helmet, And Judah my sceptre.

9. Moab shall be my washbowl; Upon Edom shall I cast my shoe; I shall triumph over Philistia.

10. Who will bring me to the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?

11. Wilt not thou, O God! who didst forsake us, Who didst not go forth with our armies?

12. Give us thine aid in our distress, For vain is the help of man!

13. Through God we shall do valiantly; For he will tread down our enemies.

## Psalms 109

1. For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.  O God of my praise! be not silent!

2. For the mouths of the wicked and the deceitful are opened against me; They speak against me with a lying tongue.

3. They assault me on every side with words of hatred; They fight against me without a cause.

4. For my love they are my adversaries: But I give myself unto prayer.

5. They repay me evil for good, And hatred for love.

6. Set thou a wicked man over him, And let an adversary stand at his right hand!

7. When he is judged, may he be condemned, And may his prayer be a crime!

8. May his days be few, And another take his office!

9. May his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow!

10. May his children be vagabonds and beggars, And from their ruined dwellings seek their bread!

11. May a creditor seize on all that he hath, And a stranger plunder his substance!

12. May there be none to show him compassion, And none to pity his fatherless children!

13. May his posterity be cut off; In the next generation may his name be blotted out!

14. May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the LORD, And may the sin of his mother never be blotted out!

15. May they be before the LORD continually; And may he cut off their memory from the earth!

16. Because he remembered not to show pity, But persecuted the afflicted and the poor man, And sought the death of the broken-hearted.

17. As he loved cursing, let it come upon him; As he delighted not in blessing, let it be far from him!

18. May he be clothed with cursing as with a garment; May it enter like water into his bowels, And like oil into his bones!

19. May it be to him like the robe that covereth him, Like the girdle with which he is constantly girded!

20. May this be the wages of mine adversaries from the LORD, And of them that speak evil against me!

21. But do thou, O LORD, my God! take part with me, For thine own name’s sake! Because great is thy mercy, O deliver me!

22. For I am afflicted and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.

23. I am going like a shadow; I am driven away as the locust.

24. My knees totter from fasting, And my flesh faileth of fatness.

25. I am a reproach to my enemies; They gaze at me; they shake their heads.

26. Help me, O LORD, my God! O save me, according to thy mercy!

27. That they may know that this is thy hand; That thou, O Lord! hast done it!

28. Let them curse, but do thou bless! When they arise, let them be put to shame; But let thy servant rejoice!

29. May my enemies be clothed with ignominy; May they be covered with their shame, as with a mantle!

30. I will earnestly praise the LORD with my lips; In the midst of the multitude I will praise him.

31. For he standeth at the right hand of the poor, To save him from those who would condemn him.

## Psalms 110

1. A psalm of David.  Jehovah said to my lord, "Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool."

2. Jehovah will extend the sceptre of thy power from Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies!

3. Thy people shall be ready, when thou musterest thy forces, in holy splendor; Thy youth shall come forth like dew from the womb of the morning.

4. Jehovah hath sworn, and he will not repent: "Thou art a priest for ever, After the order of Melchisedeck!"

5. The Lord is at thy right hand, He shall crush kings in the day of his wrath.

6. He shall execute justice among the nations; He shall fill them with dead bodies, He shall crush the heads of his enemies over many lands.

7. He shall drink of the brook in the way; Therefore shall he lift up his head.

## Psalms 111

1. Praise ye the LORD! I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, In the assembly of the righteous, and in the congregation.

2. The works of the LORD are great, Sought out by all who have pleasure in them.

3. His deeds are honorable and glorious, And his righteousness endureth for ever.

4. He hath established a memorial of his wonders; The LORD is gracious and full of compassion.

5. He giveth meat to them that fear him; He is ever mindful of his covenant.

6. He showed his people the greatness of his works, When he gave them the inheritance of the heathen.

7. The deeds of his hands are truth and justice; All his commandments are sure;

8. They stand firm for ever and ever, Being founded in truth and justice.

9. He sent redemption to his people; He established his covenant for ever; Holy, and to be had in reverence, is his name.

10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they who keep his commandments; His praise endureth for ever.

## Psalms 112

1. Praise ye the LORD! Happy the man who feareth the LORD, Who taketh delight in his commandments!

2. His posterity shall be mighty on the earth; The race of the righteous shall be blessed.

3. Wealth and riches shall be in his house; His righteousness shall endure for ever.

4. To the righteous shall arise light out of darkness; He is gracious and full of compassion and righteousness.

5. Happy the man who hath pity and lendeth! He shall sustain his cause in judgment;

6. Yea, he shall never be moved: The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

7. He is not afraid of evil tidings; His heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.

8. His heart is firm; he hath no fear, Till he see his desire upon his enemies.

9. He hath scattered blessings; he hath given to the poor; His righteousness shall endure for ever; His horn shall be exalted with honor.

10. The wicked shall see, and be grieved; He shall gnash his teeth, and melt away; The desire of the wicked shall perish.

## Psalms 113

1. Praise ye the LORD! Praise, O ye servants of the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD!

2. Blessed be the name of the LORD From this time forth, even for ever!

3. From the rising of the sun to its going down, May the LORD’S name be praised!

4. The LORD is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.

5. Who is like the LORD, our God, That dwelleth on high,

6. That looketh down low Upon the heavens and the earth?

7. He raiseth the poor from the dust, And exalteth the needy from the dunghill,

8. To set him among princes, Even among the princes of his people.

9. He causeth the barren woman to dwell in a house, A joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD!

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel came forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,

2. Judah was his sanctuary, And Israel his dominion.

3. The sea beheld, and fled; The Jordan turned back.

4. The mountains skipped like rams, And the hills like lambs.

5. What aileth thee, O thou sea! that thou fleest? Thou, Jordan, that thou runnest back?

6. Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams, And ye hills like lambs?

7. Tremble, O earth! at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob;

8. Who turned the rock into a standing lake, And the flint into a fountain of water!

## Psalms 115

1. Not unto us, O LORD! not unto us, But unto thy name, give glory, For thy mercy and thy truth’s sake!

2. Why should the nations say, "Where is now their God?"

3. Our God is in the heavens; He doeth whatever he pleaseth.

4. Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands:

5. They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;

6. They have ears, but they hear not; Noses have they, but they smell not;

7. They have hands, but they handle not; They have feet, but they walk not; Nor do they speak with their throats.

8. They who make them are like unto them; And so is every one that trusteth in them.

9. O Israel! trust thou in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.

10. O house of Aaron! trust ye in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.

11. Ye that fear the LORD trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.

13. He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

14. The LORD will increase you more and more, You and your children.

15. Blessed are ye of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.

16. The heaven is the LORD’S heaven; But the earth he hath given to the sons of men.

17. The dead praise not the LORD,—No one who goeth down into silence.

18. But we will bless the LORD, From this time forth even for ever! Praise ye the LORD!

## Psalms 116

1. I rejoice that the LORD hath heard the voice of my supplication,

2. That he hath inclined his ear to me and heard me; I will call upon him as long as I live.

3. The snares of death encompassed me, And the pains of the underworld seized upon me; I found distress and sorrow.

4. Then called I upon the LORD: O LORD! deliver me!

5. Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful.

6. The LORD preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and he helped me.

7. Return, O my soul! to thy rest! For the LORD hath dealt kindly with thee.

8. For thou hast preserved me from death; Thou hast kept mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling!

9. I shall walk before the LORD, In the land of the living.

11. I said in my distress, "All men are liars."

12. What shall I render to the LORD For all his benefits to me?

13. I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the LORD;

14. I will pay my vows to the LORD, In the presence of all his people.

15. Precious in the eyes of the LORD Is the death of his holy ones.

16. Hear, O LORD! for I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid! Thou hast loosed my bonds.

17. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the LORD.

18. I will pay my vows to the LORD In the presence of all his people,

4. Let all who fear the LORD say, His kindness endureth for ever!

5. I called upon the LORD in distress; He heard, and set me in a wide place.

6. The LORD is on my side, I will not fear: What can man do to me?

7. The LORD is my helper; I shall see my desire upon my enemies.

8. It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in man;

9. It is better to trust in the LORD Than to put confidence in princes.

10. All the nations beset me around, But in the name of the LORD I destroyed them.

11. They beset me on every side; But in the name of the LORD I destroyed them.

12. They beset me around like bees; They were quenched like the fire of thorns, For in the name of the LORD I destroyed them.

13. Thou didst assail me with violence to bring me down! But the LORD was my support.

14. The LORD is my glory and my song; For to him I owe my salvation.

15. The voice of joy and salvation is in the habitations of the righteous: "The right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly;

16. The right hand of the LORD is exalted; The right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly."

17. I shall not die, but live, And declare the deeds of the LORD.

18. The LORD hath sorely chastened me, But he hath not given me over to death.

19. Open to me the gates of righteousness, That I may go in, and praise the LORD!

20. This is the gate of the LORD, Through which the righteous enter.

21. I praise thee that thou hast heard me, And hast been my salvation.

22. "The stone which the builders rejected Hath become the chief corner-stone.

23. This is the LORD’S doing; It is marvellous in our eyes!

24. This is the day which the LORD hath made; Let us rejoice and be glad in it!

25. Hear, O LORD! and bless us! Hear, O LORD! and send us prosperity!"

26. "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD! We bless you from the house of the LORD."

27. "Jehovah is God, he hath shone upon us: Bind the sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar!"

28. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee; Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee!

29. O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; For his kindness endureth for ever!

## Psalms 119

6. If I do not remember thee, Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy!

4. For before the word is upon my tongue, Behold, O LORD! thou knowest it altogether!

5. Thou besettest me behind and before, And layest thine hand upon me!

6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain to it!

8. If I ascend into heaven, thou art there! If I make my bed in the underworld, behold, thou art there!

9. If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the remotest parts of the sea,

10. Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me!

11. If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me;" Even the night shall be light about me.

17. How precious to me are thy thoughts, O God! How great is the sum of them!

18. If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee!

19. O that thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God! Ye men of blood, depart from me!

20. For they speak against thee wickedly; Thine enemies utter thy name for falsehood.

21. Do I not hate them that hate thee, O LORD? Do I not abhor them that rise up against thee?

22. Yea, I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies.

4. Defend me, O LORD! from the hands of the wicked, Preserve me from the man of violence, Who have purposed to cause my fall! [Pause.]

6. I say to Jehovah, Thou art my God; Hear, O Jehovah! the voice of my supplication!

7. The Lord Jehovah is my saving strength: Thou shelterest my head in the day of battle!

8. Grant not, O LORD! the desires of the wicked; Let not their devices prosper; Let them not exalt themselves!

9. As for the heads of those who encompass me, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them!

11. The slanderer shall not be established upon the earth; Evil shall pursue the violent man to destruction.

2. Let my prayer come before thee as incense, And the lifting-up of my hands, as the evening sacrifice!

3. Set a watch, O LORD! before my mouth; Guard the door of my lips!

4. Let not my heart incline to any evil thing; Let me not practise wickedness with the doers of iniquity, And let me not eat of their delicacies!

5. Let the righteous smite me,—it shall be a kindness; Let him reprove me, and it shall be oil for my head; Let him do it again, and my head shall not refuse it; But now I pray against their wickedness!

6. When their judges are hurled over the side of the rock, They shall hear how pleasant are my words.

7. So are our bones scattered at the mouth of the underworld, As when one furroweth and ploweth up the land.

8. But to thee do my eyes look, O Lord Jehovah! In thee is my trust; Let not my life be poured out!

10. Let the wicked fall together into their own traps, Whilst I make my escape!

3. When my spirit is overwhelmed within me, Thou knowest my path! In the way which I walk, they have hid a snare for me.

4. I look on my right hand, and behold, But no man knoweth me; Refuge faileth me; No one careth for me.

5. I cry unto thee, O LORD! I say, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.

6. Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they prevail against me!

## Psalms 143

1. A psalm of David.  Hear my prayer, O LORD! give ear to my supplications! In thy faithfulness, and in thy righteousness, answer me!

2. Enter not into judgment with thy servant; For before thee no man living is righteous.

3. For the enemy pursueth my life; He hath smitten me to the ground; He hath made me dwell in darkness, As those that have been dead of old.

4. My spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate.

5. I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the deeds of thy hands.

6. I stretch forth my hands unto thee; My soul thirsteth for thee, like a parched land.

7. Hear me speedily, O LORD! My spirit faileth; Hide not thy face from me. Lest I become like those who go down to the pit!

8. Cause me so see thy loving-kindness speedily; For in thee do I trust! Make known to me the way which I should take; For to thee do I lift up my soul!

9. Deliver me, O LORD! from mine enemies; For in thee do I seek refuge!

10. Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God! Let thy good spirit lead me in a plain path!

3. LORD, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?

4. Man is like a vapor; His day is like a shadow that passeth away.

5. Bow thy heavens, O LORD! and come down; Touch the mountains, so that they shall smoke!

6. Cast forth lightnings, and scatter them; Shoot forth thine arrows, and destroy them!

7. Send forth thine hand from above; Rescue and save me from deep waters; From the hands of aliens,

8. Whose mouth uttereth deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood!

9. I will sing to thee a new song, O God! Upon a ten-stringed psaltery will I sing praise to thee;

10. To thee, who givest salvation to kings, Who deliverest David, thy servant, from the destructive sword!

11. Rescue and deliver me from the hands of aliens, Whose mouth uttereth deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood!

12. That our sons may be as plants, Grown up in their youth; Our daughters as corner-pillars, Hewn like those of a palace!

13. That our garners may be full, Affording all kinds of store; That our sheep may bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our streets.

14. That our cattle may be fruitful; That there be no breaking in, or going out; And no outcry in our streets.

15. Happy the people that is in such a state! Yea, happy the people whose God is Jehovah!
