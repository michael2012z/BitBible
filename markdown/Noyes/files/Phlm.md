# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1. Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved friend and fellow-laborer,

2. and to the beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:

3. Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I thank my God at all times, making mention of thee in my prayers,

5. hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;

6. that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, for Christ Jesus.

7. For we have great thankfulness and comfort on account of thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.

8. Wherefore, though I have much boldness in Christ to enjoin upon thee that which is befitting,

9. yet for loveâ€™s sake I beseech thee rather; being such a one as Paul an old man, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus,

10. I beseech thee for my child, whom I begot in my bonds, Onesimus;

11. who in time past was unprofitable to thee, but is now profitable to thee and to me;

12. whom I have sent back; and do thou [receive] him, that is, my own flesh.

13. Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel;

14. but I chose to do nothing without thy consent, that thy benefit may be not as from necessity, but willingly.

15. For perhaps he was separated from thee for a season to this end, that thou shouldst receive him back as thine for ever;

16. no longer as a bond-servant, but above a bond-servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord!

17. If thou then regardest me as a partner, receive him as myself.

18. And if he wronged thee in anything, or oweth thee, put that to my account.

19. I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it; not to say to thee, that to me thou owest even thy own self besides.

20. Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.

21. Having confidence in thy obedience I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.

22. And at the same time make ready a lodging for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.

23. Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus,

24. Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-laborers, salute thee.

25. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
