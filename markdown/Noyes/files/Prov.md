## Proverbs 1

1. The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:

2. That one may learn wisdom and instruction, And receive words of understanding;

3. That one may gain the instruction of prudence, Justice, equity, and uprightness;

4. Which will give caution to the simple, To the young man wisdom and discretion;

5. Let the wise man hear, and he will increase his knowledge, And the man of understanding will gain wise counsels;

6. So as to understand a proverb and a deep maxim, The words of the wise and their dark sayings.

7. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction.

8. Hear, O my son! the instruction of thy father, And neglect not the teaching of thy mother!

9. For they shall be a graceful wreath for thy head, And a chain around thy neck.

10. My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not!

11. If they say, "Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us lurk secretly for him who is innocent in vain;

12. Let us swallow them up alive, like the underworld, Yea, in full health, as those that go down into the pit;

13. We shall find all kinds of precious substance, We shall fill our houses with spoil;

14. Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse;"—

15. My son, walk thou not in their way, Refrain thy foot from their path!

16. For their feet run to evil, And make haste to shed blood.

17. For as the net is spread in vain Before the eyes of any bird,

18. So they lie in wait for their own blood; They lurk secretly for their own lives.

19. Such are the ways of every one greedy of unjust gain; It taketh away the life of the possessor thereof.

20. Wisdom crieth out in the highway; In the market-place she uttereth her voice;

21. At the head of the noisy streets she crieth aloud; At the entrances of the gates, throughout the city, she proclaimeth her words [saying]:

22. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? How long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn ye at my reproof! Behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make known my words to you!

24. "Because I have called, and ye have refused,—Because I have stretched out my hand, and no one hath regarded.

25. Because ye have rejected all my counsel, And have slighted my rebuke,—

26. I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;

27. When your fear cometh upon you like a storm. And destruction overtaketh you like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.

28. Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer! They will seek me early, But they shall not find me!

29. Because they have hated knowledge, And have not chosen the fear of the LORD,—

30. Because they would not attend to my counsel, And have despised all my reproof,—

31. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own devices;

32. Yea, the turning away of the simple shall slay them, And the carelessness of fools shall destroy them.

33. But whoso hearkeneth to me shall dwell securely, And shall not be disquieted with the fear of evil."

## Proverbs 2

1. Oh, my son, that thou wouldst receive my words, And treasure up my precepts within thee;

2. That thou wouldst apply thine ear to wisdom, And incline thy heart to understanding!

3. For if thou wilt call aloud to knowledge, And lift up thy voice to understanding,—

4. If thou wilt seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures,

5. Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God.

6. For the LORD giveth wisdom; From his mouth proceed knowledge and understanding:

7. He layeth up safety for the righteous; He is a shield to them that walk uprightly:

8. He guardeth the paths of equity, And defendeth the way of his servants.

9. Then shalt thou understand righteousness and equity And uprightness, yea, every good path.

10. When wisdom entereth into thy heart, And knowledge is pleasant to thy soul,

11. Discretion will guard thee, Understanding will preserve thee.

12. It will deliver thee from the way of the wicked, From the men who speak perverse things;

13. Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;

14. Who rejoice in doing evil, And delight in the perverseness of the wicked;

15. Whose paths are crooked, And who are froward in their ways.

16. It will deliver thee from the wife of another, From the stranger, who useth smooth words;

17. Who forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God.

18. For her house sinketh down to Death, And her paths to the shades of the dead:

19. None that go to her return again; They will not attain the paths of life.

20. Therefore walk thou in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous:

21. For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the righteous shall remain in it;

22. But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, forget not my teaching, And let thy heart observe my precepts!

2. For length of days, and years of life, And peace shall they multiply to thee.

3. Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; Bind them around thy neck, Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:

4. Then shalt thou find favor and good success In the sight of God and man.

5. Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, And lean not on thine own understanding;

6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will make thy paths plain.

7. Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.

8. It shall be health to thy muscles, And moisture to thy bones.

9. Honor the LORD with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thy increase;

10. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats overflow with new wine.

11. My son, despise not the correction of the LORD, Nor be impatient under his chastisement!

12. For whom the LORD loveth he chasteneth, Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.

13. Happy the man who findeth wisdom; Yea, the man who getteth understanding!

14. For the profit thereof is greater than that of silver, And the gain thereof than that of fine gold.

15. More precious is she than pearls, And none of thy jewels is to be compared with her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.

18. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold of her, And happy is every one who hath her in his grasp.

19. The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he framed the heavens.

20. By his knowledge the deep waters were cleft, And the clouds drop down the dew.

21. My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion!

22. For they shall be life to thy soul, And grace to thy neck.

23. Then shalt thou go on thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble;

24. When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid, Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

25. Be not thou afraid of sudden alarm, Nor of the storm that is for the wicked, when it cometh;

26. For the LORD shall be thy confidence; Yea, he will keep thy foot from being taken.

27. Withhold not kindness from those who need it, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.

28. Say not to thy neighbor, "Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give to thee," when thou hast it by thee.

29. Devise not evil against thy neighbor, While he dwelleth securely by thee.

30. Contend not with a man without cause, When he hath done thee no harm.

31. Envy not the oppressor, And choose none of his ways.

32. For the perverse man is the abomination of the LORD, But he is in friendship with the upright.

33. The curse of the LORD is upon the house of the wicked, But he blesseth the dwelling of the righteous.

34. Surely the scorners he treadeth scornfully, But giveth favor to the lowly.

35. The wise shall obtain honor, But fools shall bear off shame.

## Proverbs 4

1. Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, And attend, that ye may learn understanding!

2. For I give you good instruction; Forsake ye not my commandments.

3. For I was my father’s son, A tender and only child in the sight of my mother.

4. He taught me, and said to me, Let thy heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments, and live.

5. Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, and depart not from, the words of my mouth.

6. Forsake her not, and she will guard thee: Love her, and she will preserve thee.

7. Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore gain wisdom, And with all thy gain, gain understanding.

8. Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her;

9. She will give to thy head a graceful wreath, A beautiful crown will she bestow upon thee.

10. Hear, O my son! and receive my sayings! So shall the years of thy life be many.

11. I have taught thee the way of wisdom, I have guided thee in the right path.

12. When thou goest, thy steps shall not be confined; And, when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

13. Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go; Keep her, for she is thy life.

14. Enter not into the path of the wicked, And go not in the way of evil men;

15. Avoid it, pass not upon it, Turn from it, and go away.

16. For they sleep not, unless they have done mischief; Yea, their sleep is taken away, unless they have caused some to fall.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.

18. But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, Which groweth brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.

19. The way of the wicked is as thick darkness; They know not at what they stumble.

20. My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear to my sayings;

21. Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart!

22. For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.

23. More than any thing which thou watchest, watch thy heart; For from it goeth forth life.

24. Put away from thee a deceitful mouth, And remove far from thee perverse lips.

25. Let thine eyes look straight forward, And thine eyelids be directed before thee.

26. Give heed to the path of thy foot, And let all thy ways be steadfast.

27. Turn not to the right hand or to the left; Remove thy foot from evil.

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, attend to my wisdom. And bow thine ear to my understanding;

2. That thou mayest keep discretion, And that thy lips may preserve knowledge!

3. Truly, the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil;

4. But her end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.

5. Her feet go down to death; Her steps lay hold of the under-world.

6. That she may not ponder the way of life, Her paths waver when she heedeth it not.

7. Hear me now, therefore, O children! And turn not away from the words of my mouth!

8. Remove thy way far from her. And come not nigh the door of her house:

9. Lest thou give thy bloom to others, And thy years to a cruel one;

10. Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, And thine earnings be in the house of an alien;

11. And lest thou mourn in thy latter end. When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

12. And say, "How have I hated instruction! And how hath my heart despised reproof!

13. I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to my instructors;

14. I have well-nigh fallen into utter misery; In the midst of the congregation and the assembly."

15. Drink water out of thine own cistern. And running water out of thine own well:

16. So shall thy fountains overflow in the streets, In the wide streets, as streams of water;

17. They shall belong to thee alone, And not to strangers with thee;

18. And thy fountain shall be blessed, Yea, thou shalt have joy in the wife of thy youth.

19. A lovely hind, a graceful doe, Her breasts shall satisfy thee at all times, And thou shalt be always ravished with her love.

20. Why, then, my son, wilt thou be ravished with a wanton, And embrace the bosom of a stranger?

21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, And he weigheth well all his paths.

22. His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked; Yea, he shall be held fast by the cords of his own sins.

23. He shall die for want of instruction; Yea, through the greatness of his folly he shall stagger.

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if thou hast become surety for another, If thou hast stricken hands for another,

2. If thou hast become ensnared by the words of thy mouth, If thou hast been caught by the words of thy mouth,

3. Do this now, my son, and rescue thyself,—Since thou hast fallen into the hands of thy neighbor,—Go, prostrate thyself, and be urgent with thy neighbor!

4. Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids;

5. Rescue thyself, as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, O sluggard! Consider her ways, and be wise!

7. She hath no governor, Nor overseer, nor ruler;

8. Yet she prepareth in the summer her food, She gathereth in the harvest her meat.

9. How long wilt thou lie in bed, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise from thy sleep?

10. "A little sleep,—a little slumber,—A little folding of the hands to rest:"

11. So shall thy poverty come upon thee like a robber, Yea, thy want, as an armed man!

12. A worthless wretch is the unrighteous man, Who walketh with a deceitful mouth;

13. Who winketh with his eyes, Speaketh with his feet, And teacheth with his fingers.

14. Fraud is in his heart; He deviseth mischief continually; He scattereth contentions.

15. Therefore shall calamity come upon him suddenly; In a moment shall he be destroyed, and that without remedy;

16. These six things doth the LORD hate; Yea, seven are an abomination to him:

17. Lofty eyes, a false tongue, And hands which shed innocent blood;

18. A heart that contriveth wicked devices; Feet that are swift in running to mischief,

19. A false witness, that uttereth lies, And him that soweth discord among brethren.

20. Keep, O my son! the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the precepts of thy mother!

21. Bind them continually to thy heart, Tie them around thy neck!

22. When thou goest forth, they shall guide thee; When thou sleepest, they shall watch over thee; And, when thou awakest, they shall talk with thee.

23. For the commandment is a lamp, and instruction a light; Yea, the rebukes of correction lead to life.

24. They shall guard thee from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the unchaste woman.

25. Desire not her beauty in thy heart, Nor let her catch thee with her eyelids;

26. For by a harlot a man is brought to a morsel of bread, And the adulteress layeth snares for the precious life.

27. Can a man take fire into his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?

28. Can one walk upon burning coals, And his feet not be scorched?

29. So is it with him who goeth in to his neighbor’s wife; Whoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished.

30. Men do not overlook a thief, Though he steal to satisfy his appetite, when he is hungry;

31. If found, he must repay sevenfold, And give up all the substance of his house.

32. Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; He that doeth it destroyeth himself;

33. Blows and dishonor shall he get, And his reproach shall not be wiped away.

34. For jealousy is the fury of a man; He will not spare in the day of vengeance;

35. And he will not pay regard to any ransom, Nor be content, though thou offer many gifts.

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my words, And treasure up my commandments with thee!

2. Keep my commandments and live! Yea, my teaching, as the apple of thine eye!

3. Bind them upon thy fingers, Write them upon the tablet of thy heart!

4. Say unto wisdom, "Thou art my sister!" And call understanding thy near acquaintance;

5. That they may keep thee from the wife of another, From the stranger, that useth smooth words.

6. For through the window of my house, Through the lattice I was looking forth,

7. And I saw among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding.

8. He was passing through the street near her corner, And was going the way to her house,

9. At twilight, in the evening, At midnight, yea, in the thick darkness.

10. And, behold, a woman met him, In the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart,—

11. One noisy and unruly, Whose feet abide not in her house;

12. Who is now in the streets, now in the broad places, And lurketh near every corner.

13. She caught hold of him and kissed him, And with a shameless face said to him,

14. "Thank-offerings have been upon me, And this day have I performed my vows;

15. Therefore came I forth to meet thee,—Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee!

16. I have spread my bed with coverlets, With tapestry of the thread of Egypt.

17. I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with caresses.

19. For the good-man is not at home; He is gone a long journey;

20. He hath taken a purse of money with him; At the day of the full moon he will return."

21. By her much fair speech she seduced him; By the smoothness of her lips she drew him away.

22. He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the chastisement of the fool,

23. Till an arrow strike through his liver; —As a bird hasteneth into the snare, And knoweth not that it is laid for its life.

24. Now, therefore, ye children, hearken to me, And attend to the words of my mouth!

25. Let not thy heart turn aside to her ways; Go not astray in her paths!

26. For many are the wounded which she hath cast down; Yea, countless is the number of those slain by her.

27. Her house is the way to the under-world, Leading down to the chambers of death.

## Proverbs 8

1. Doth not wisdom cry aloud, And understanding put forth her voice?

2. Upon the top of the high places, By the wayside, In the cross-ways, She taketh her station.

3. By the side of the gates, In the entrance of the city, In the approaches to the doors, she crieth aloud.

4. "To you, O men! do I call, And my voice is to the sons of men!

5. O ye simple ones! learn wisdom, And ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart!

6. Hear, for I speak excellent things, And my lips utter that which is right.

7. For my mouth speaketh truth, And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

8. All the words of my mouth are in uprightness; There is nothing crooked or deceitful in them;

9. They are all plain to the man of understanding, And right to those who find knowledge.

10. Receive my instruction, and not silver. And knowledge rather than choice gold!

11. For wisdom is better than pearls, And no precious things are to be compared with her.

12. "I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out the knowledge of sagacious counsels.

13. The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, And the deceitful mouth, do I hate.

14. Counsel is mine, and sound reason; I am understanding; I have strength.

15. By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.

16. By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

17. I love them that love me, And they who seek me early shall find me.

18. Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable riches and prosperity.

19. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold. And my revenue than choice silver.

20. I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of equity.

21. I cause those who love me to possess substance; Yea, I fill their treasuries.

22. "The LORD created me, the firstling of his course, Before his works, of old;

23. I was anointed from everlasting, From the beginning, even before the earth was made.

24. When as yet there were no deeps, I was brought forth. When there were no springs, abounding with water.

25. Before the mountains were settled, Yea, before the hills, I was brought forth;

26. Ere yet he had made the land and the wastes, And the first of the clods of the earth.

27. When he framed the heavens, I was there; When he drew a circle upon the face of the deep;

28. When he made firm the sky above, And the fountains of the deep rushed forth;

29. When he gave to the sea its bounds, that the waters should not pass their border; When he marked out the foundations of the earth,—

30. Then was I by him as a master-builder; I was his delight day by day, Exulting before him at all times;

31. Exulting in the habitable part of his earth, And my delight was with the sons of men.

32. "Now, therefore, ye children, hearken to me! For happy are they who keep my ways!

33. Hear instruction, and be wise! Yea, reject it not!

34. Happy the man who hearkeneth to me, Who watcheth day by day at my gates, Who waiteth at the posts of my doors;

35. For he that findeth me findeth life, And obtaineth favor from the LORD;

36. But he who misseth me doeth violence to himself; All they who hate me love death."

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars.

2. She hath killed her fatlings; She hath mingled her wine; Yea, she hath furnished her table.

3. She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth aloud upon the highest places of the city:

4. "Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither!" To him that is void of understanding she saith,

5. "Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled!

6. Forsake folly, and live! And go forward in the way of understanding!

7. "He who correcteth a scoffer Bringeth shame upon himself; And he who rebuketh the wicked Bringeth upon himself a stain.

8. Rebuke not a scoffer, lest he hate thee; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.

9. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; Teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.

10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Most Holy is understanding.

11. Yea, through me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.

12. If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou art a scoffer, thou alone must bear it."

13. The foolish woman is clamorous; She is very simple, and careth for nothing.

14. She sitteth at the door of her house, Upon a seat in the high places of the city,

15. To call aloud to those that pass by, Who go straight forward in their ways,

16. "Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither!" And to him that is void of understanding she saith,

17. "Stolen water is sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant."

18. But he considereth not that the dead are there, That in the vales of the under-world are her guests.
