## Ezekiel 1

1. Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

2. On the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year of the captivity of King Jehoiachin,

3. the word of Jehovah came to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldaeans, by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.

4. And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came from the north, a great cloud, and a mass of fire; and a brightness was round about it, and in the midst of it the appearance of bright brass, in the midst of the fire.

5. And in the midst of it were the forms of four living creatures. And this was their appearance. They had the form of a man.

6. And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

7. And their feet were upright; and the sole of their feet was as the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like polished brass.

8. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides, and all four had faces and wings.

9. Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not about when they went; they went every one straight forward.

10. As for the form of their faces, all four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side, and all four had the face of an ox on the left side, and all four had also the face of an eagle.

11. Thus were their faces. And their wings were expanded upward; two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies.

12. And they went every one straight forward; whither the spirit was to go, they went, and they turned not about when they went.

13. And the appearance of the living creatures was as coals of fire, burning like torches; and the fire moved about among the living creatures, and shone forth brightly; and out of the fire came forth lightning.

14. And the living creatures ran backward and forward like a flash of lightning.

15. Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, there stood a wheel upon the earth by each of the living creatures, with its four sides.

16. The appearance of the wheels, and their work, was like that of a chrysolite, and all four had one form, and their appearance and their work was as if a wheel had been within a wheel.

17. When they went, they went upon their four sides, and they turned not about when they went.

18. As for their felloes, they were high and terrible; and their felloes were full of eyes round about upon all four of them.

19. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

20. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, whithersoever the spirit was to go; and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

21. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

22. And over the heads of the living creatures was the appearance of a firmament, like crystal, terrible, spread out over their heads above.

23. And under the firmament were their wings upright, the one toward the other; and every one had two, which covered his body.

24. And I heard the sound of their wings, as the sound of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, when they went,—a sound like the noise of a host. And when they stood still, they let down their wings.

25. And there was a voice from the firmament, that was over their heads; and they stood still, and let down their wings.

26. And above the firmament over their heads was an appearance like a sapphire-stone, the form of a throne; and upon the form of the throne there was a form like that of a man above.

27. And I saw what had the appearance of bright brass, what had the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins and upward. And from the appearance of his loins downward I saw what had the appearance of fire, and its brightness was round about him.

28. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one who spoke.

## Ezekiel 2

1. And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.

2. And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake with me.

3. And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious nation, that hath rebelled against me; they and their fathers have rebelled against me to this very day.

4. Brazen-faced and stiff-hearted are the sons to whom I send thee. And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.

5. And whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are a rebellious house, yet shall they know that a prophet is in the midst of them.

6. And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, and of their words be not afraid, though they be briers and thorns toward thee, and though thou dwell among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.

7. Speak thou my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.

8. But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee! Be not thou rebellious, like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.

9. And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and lo, a book-roll was therein.

10. And he spread it before me, and it was written within and without. And therein was written lamentation and mourning and woe.

## Ezekiel 3

1. And he said to me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak to the house of Israel!

2. So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the roll to eat.

3. And he said to me, Son of man, let thy stomach eat, and fill thy body with this roll which I give thee! Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

4. And he said to me: Son of man, go, get thee to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them!

5. For not to a people of a dark speech and a hard language art thou sent, but to the house of Israel;

6. not to many nations of a dark speech and a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Truly, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened to thee.

7. But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee, for they will not hearken to me. For the whole house of Israel is brazen-faced and stiff-hearted.

8. Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

9. As an adamant, harder than flint, have I made thy forehead; fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks; for they are a rebellious house.

10. Moreover, he said to me: Son of man, all my words, which I shall speak to thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears!

11. And go, get thee to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

12. Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound, as of a great rushing, saying, "Praised be the majesty of Jehovah from his place!"

13. I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures, that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even a noise of a great rushing.

14. So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.

15. Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar; and I dwelt where they dwelt; I even dwelt astonished among them seven days.

16. And at the end of seven days, the word of Jehovah came to me, and said:

17. Son of man, I have set thee as a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me!

18. When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die! and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, so that he may live, that wicked man shall die for his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.

19. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, and from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.

20. Again, when a righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, and he shall die because thou hast not given him warning, he will die for his sin; and his righteousness which he hath done will not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.

21. Yet if thou warn the righteous man, that he sin not, and the righteous man doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he hath received warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.

22. And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me, and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and there will I speak with thee.

23. Then I arose, and went forth into the plain, and lo, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

24. Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet. And he spake with me, and said to me: Go, shut thyself within thy house.

25. And behold, O son of man, bands shall be put upon thee, and thou shalt be bound therewith; and thou shalt not go out among them.

26. And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.

27. But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that will hear, let him hear, and he that will forbear, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 4

1. And thou, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem.

2. And lay siege against it, and build a tower against it, and cast up a mound against it; set a camp also against it, and place battering-rams against it round about.

3. Moreover, take thou an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, that it may be besieged; and lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

4. Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.

5. But for the years of their iniquity I appoint thee days, three hundred and ninety days; so long shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

6. And when thou hast brought them to an end, then lie upon thy right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have appointed thee a day for a year.

7. And set thy face against besieged Jerusalem, and uncover thine arm, and prophesy against it!

8. And behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.

9. Take thou also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them into one vessel, and make thereof thy bread for the number of days that thou shalt lie upon thy side; three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

10. And thy food which thou eatest shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time shalt thou eat it.

11. Thou shalt also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from time to time shalt thou drink.

12. Thou shalt also eat barley-cakes; and with dung that cometh out of man shalt thou bake them in their sight.

13. And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the sons of Israel eat their polluted food among the nations, whither I will drive them.

14. Then said I: Ah! Lord Jehovah, behold, I have never been polluted; for from my youth until now have I not eaten that which died of itself, or was torn in pieces; neither hath unclean food come into my mouth.

15. Then he said to me: Behold, I give thee cow’s dung for man’s dung; and with that shalt thou prepare thy food.

16. And he said to me: Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and with care, and they shall drink water by measure and in amazement;

17. so that they shall be in want of bread and water, and be astonished one at another, and consume away for their iniquity.

## Ezekiel 5

1. And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp instrument, even a barber’s razor, and cause it to pass upon thy head and thy beard; and take thee weighing-balances, and divide the hair.

2. A third part shalt thou burn with fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part and smite it round about with the sword; and a third part shalt thou scatter in the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.

3. Thou shalt also take thereof a small number, and bind them in thy skirts.

4. And of these again take some and cast them into the fire, and burn them in the fire. From them shall a fire come forth upon the whole house of Israel.

5. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem; in the midst of the nations have I set her, and countries are round about her.

6. But she hath wickedly resisted my ordinances more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries, that are round about her. For they have refused my ordinances, and have not walked in my statutes.

7. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have been rebellious more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, nor kept my ordinances, but have done according to the ordinances of the nations which are round about you,

8. therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments against thee in the sight of the nations.

9. I will do to thee that which I have not yet done, and the like of which I shall not do again, because of all thine iniquities.

10. Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter the whole remnant of thee to all the winds.

11. Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, because thou hast polluted my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also withdraw mine eye from thee; neither will I spare, neither will I have any pity.

12. A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence, or be consumed with hunger in the midst of thee; and a third part shall die by the sword round about thee; and a third part will I scatter to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

13. Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will satiate my fury upon them, and receive satisfaction; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my fury upon them.

14. Moreover, I will make thee a waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.

15. And thou shalt be a reproach, and a reviling, and a warning, and an astonishment to the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes; —I, Jehovah, have spoken it; —

16. when I shall send upon you the evil arrows of famine which bring destruction, which I send to destroy you, and increase the famine upon you, and break your staff of bread.

17. And I will send upon you famine, and evil beasts, which shall make thee childless; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and the sword will I bring upon thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 6

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, set thy face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them!

3. And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the plains and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring the sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places;

4. and your altars shall be desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain before your idols.

5. And I will lay the carcasses of the sons of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

6. In all places where ye dwell shall the cities be laid waste, and the high places be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken, and cease, and your sun-images may be cut down, and your works may be destroyed.

7. And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.

8. Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall have escaped the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.

9. And they of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, when I have broken their whorish heart which departed from me, and their eyes which went lusting after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.

10. Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, and that I have not said in vain, that I would do all this evil to them.

11. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite upon thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence shall they fall.

12. He that is far off shall die by pestilence, and he that is near shall fall by the sword, and he that remaineth and is preserved shall die by famine. Thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.

13. Then shall ye know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, upon all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, in every place where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.

14. So will I stretch out my hand against them, and make the land desolate; yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 7

1. Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Thou son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the land of Israel:—

3. The end cometh, the end cometh, Upon the four corners of the land! Now cometh the end upon thee! For I will send my anger upon thee, And will judge thee according to thy ways, And will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

4. And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; But I will recompense thy ways upon thee, And thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

5. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an unheard-of evil, behold, it cometh!

6. The end cometh, the end cometh! It awaketh against thee, behold, it cometh!

7. Thy fate cometh upon thee, thou that dwellest in the land! The time is come, The day of tumult is near, When no sound of joy shall be upon the mountains.

8. Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, And accomplish mine anger against thee; And I will judge thee according to thy ways, And recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

9. And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will recompense thee according to thy ways, And thine abominations shall come upon thee; And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, smite you.

10. Behold, the day, behold, it cometh! The destiny draweth near; The rod hath blossomed, pride hath flourished.

11. Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; None of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their crowd; Nor shall there be wailing for them.

12. The time cometh, the day draweth near! Let not the buyer rejoice, Nor the seller mourn; For wrath is against their whole multitude.

13. For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, Though he be yet alive; For the vision against their whole multitude shall not return void, And none that liveth in his iniquity shall strengthen himself

14. "Blow ye the trumpet, and let all be ready!" Yet none goeth to the battle; For mine anger is against their whole multitude.

15. The sword is without, and pestilence and famine within; He that is in the field shall die by the sword; And he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

16. And those of them that escape shall be upon the mountains like doves of the valleys, All of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.

17. All hands shall be feeble, And all knees shall flow with water.

18. They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, And horror shall cover them. And upon all their faces shall be shame, And upon all their heads baldness.

19. Their silver shall they cast into the streets, And their gold shall be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them In the day of the wrath of Jehovah; Their hunger shall not be satisfied, Nor their body filled with it; For it was the stumbling-block of their iniquity.

20. For the beauty of their ornaments they turned into pride, And the images of their abominations and of their detestable things they made with it; Therefore will I make it to them as an unclean thing.

21. And I will give it into the hands of strangers for a prey, And to the wicked of the earth for a spoil, And they shall pollute it.

22. And I will turn my face from them, So that my secret place shall be polluted; Robbers shall enter into it, and pollute it.

23. Make a chain! For the land is full of blood-guiltiness, And the city is full of violence.

24. Therefore will I bring the most cruel among the nations, And they shall possess your houses; I will also make the pride of the strong to cease, And their holy places shall be defiled.

25. Destruction cometh; And they shall seek peace, and not find it.

26. Calamity shall come upon calamity, And rumor shall be upon rumor; And they shall seek a vision from the prophet in vain; Instruction shall perish from the priests, And counsel from the elders.

27. The king shall mourn, And the prince shall be clothed with amazement; And the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them, And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 8

1. Now it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.

2. And I looked, and lo, a form having the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins downward, of fire; and from his loins upward, of a bright light, like the splendor of shining brass.

3. And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head. And the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me, in the visions of God, to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate, that looketh toward the north, where stood the idol of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.

4. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I saw in the plain.

5. Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes toward the north! And I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, northward from the gate of the altar was this idol of jealousy, at the entrance.

6. And he said to me: Son of man, seest thou what they do? Great are the abominations which the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary. But thou shalt yet again see great abominations.

7. And he brought me to the door of the court, and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.

8. And he said to me, Son of man, break now through the wall. And when I had broken through the wall, behold, a door.

9. And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations which they practise here.

10. So I went in and saw, and behold, every form of creeping things, and of abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.

11. And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, standing in the midst of them, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.

12. Then said he to me: Son of man, seest thou what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each one in his image-chamber? For they say, "Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land."

13. And he said to me, Thou shalt yet again see the great abominations which they practise.

14. Then he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which was toward the north, and behold, there sat women, weeping for Thammuz.

15. And he said to me, Seest thou this, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see greater abominations than these.

16. And he brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and behold, at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they bowed themselves eastward toward the sun.

17. And he said to me: Seest thou, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah, that they commit the abominations which they commit here, that they fill the land with violence, and continually provoke me to anger? And behold, they put the blanch to their nostrils.

18. Therefore will I also deal with them in fury; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

## Ezekiel 9

1. He cried also, in my hearing, with a loud voice, saying: Bring ye near the punishments of the city, every one his weapon of destruction in his hand.

2. And lo, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which looketh toward the north, every one with his slaughter-weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s ink-horn by his side; and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.

3. And the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub upon which it was to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer’s ink-horn by his side;

4. and Jehovah said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that wail for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.

5. And to the others he said, in my hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite! let not your eyes spare, neither have ye pity!

6. The old man, the youth, the virgin, little children and women, slay and destroy; but come not near any one upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then began they at the elders that were before the house.

7. And he said to them, Pollute the house, and fill the courts with the slain, then go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.

8. And while they were smiting them, I alone was left; and I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the remnant of Israel, while thou pourest out thy fury upon Jerusalem?

9. And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness. For they say, "Jehovah hath forsaken the land"; and, "Jehovah seeth not."

10. Therefore mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity. Their way will I recompense upon their head.

11. And lo, the man clothed with linen, who had the ink-horn by his side, returned answer, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.

## Ezekiel 10

1. Then I looked, and lo, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubs there appeared over them as it were a sapphire-stone, in form like a throne;

2. and He spake to the man that was clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels under the cherub, and fill thy hands with coals of fire, which are between the cherubs, and scatter them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.

3. Now the cherubs stood upon the right side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

4. And the glory of Jehovah was lifted up from the cherub to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.

5. And the sound of the wings of the cherubs was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God, the Almighty, when he speaketh.

6. And when he commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubs, he went in and stood beside the wheels.

7. And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubs to the fire that was between the cherubs, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen, who took it, and went out.

8. And there was seen in the cherubs the form of a man’s hand under their wings.

9. And when I looked, behold, four wheels were by the cherubs, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like that of a chrysolite.

10. And as to their appearance, all four had one form, as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.

11. When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not about when they went; but to the place whither the head looked they followed it, they turned not about when they went.

12. And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels which they four had.

13. And as to these wheels, each one of them in my hearing was called Whirlwind.

14. And every one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

15. And the cherubs were lifted up. They were the living creatures which I saw by the river Chebar.

16. And when the cherubs went, the wheels went with them; and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels turned not away from their side.

17. When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these were liked up with them. For the spirit of the living creatures was in them.

18. Then the glory of Jehovah departed from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubs.

19. And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight, as they went out, and the wheels were beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

20. They were the living creatures which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubs.

21. Every one had four faces, and every one four wings, and the form of a man’s hand was under their wings.

22. And as for the form of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They went every one straight forward.

## Ezekiel 11

1. Then the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the house of Jehovah, that looketh toward the east; and behold, at the entrance of the gate were five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah, the son of Azur, and Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.

2. Then said He to me: These are the men that devise mischief, and form evil designs in this city;

3. who say, "The time is not near that we should build houses. This city is the caldron, and we are the flesh."

4. Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!

5. And the spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said to me, Speak: Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel! For I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.

6. Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.

7. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain, whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but you will I bring forth out of the midst of it.

8. Ye have feared the sword, and the sword will I bring upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.

9. And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments upon you.

10. Ye shall fall by the sword; on the borders of Israel will I judge you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.

11. This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof. On the borders of Israel will I judge you,

12. that ye may know that I am Jehovah, in whose statutes ye have not walked, and whose ordinances ye have not observed, but have done according to the manners of the nations, that are round about you.

13. And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah, wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?

14. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

15. Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy near kindred, and the whole house of Israel, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem say, "Remove ye far from Jehovah; to us is the land given in possession!"

16. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Though I have cast them far off among the nations, and scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them as a sanctuary for a short time in the countries whither they are come.

17. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the nations, and assemble you from the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

18. And they shall come thither, and they shall take away from thence all the detestable things thereof, and all the abominations thereof.

19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them; and I will take out of them the heart of stone, and will give them a heart of flesh,

20. that they may walk in my statutes, and observe my ordinances, and keep them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

21. But as for them whose heart walketh according to the pleasure of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.

22. Then did the cherubs lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

23. And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

24. Then the spirit took me up, and brought me to Chaldaea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God. And the vision which I had seen went up from me.

25. Then I spake to them of the captivity all the words of Jehovah which he had showed me.

## Ezekiel 12

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house; they have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.

3. Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing from the land; and remove by day in their sight, and remove from thy place to another place before their eyes. It may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.

4. And carry forth thy stuff, as stuff for removing, by day in their sight, and go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.

5. Before their eyes break thou through the wall, and carry forth thereby.

6. In their sight bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight. Cover thy face, so that thou see not the ground; for I have made thee a sign to the house of Israel.

7. And I did as I was commanded, I carried forth my stuff, as stuff for removing from the land, by day; and in the evening I broke through the wall with my hand; I carried it forth in the twilight; I took it upon my shoulder before their eyes.

8. And the word of Jehovah came to me in the morning, and said:

9. Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, "What doest thou?"

10. Say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that is therein.

11. Say, I am your sign. As I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall remove and go into captivity.

12. And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth. They shall break through the wall to carry forth thereby; he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.

13. I will also spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, into the land of the Chaldaeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.

14. And all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands, will I scatter to every wind; and I will draw out the sword after them.

15. And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them in the countries.

16. But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen, whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

17. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

18. Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;

19. and say to the people of the land: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel; their bread shall they eat with carefulness, and their water shall they drink with astonishment; that their land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of them that dwell in it.

20. And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.

21. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

22. Son of man, what meaneth that proverb which ye have in the land of Israel, saying, "The days are delayed, and every vision faileth"?

23. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are at hand, and what is declared in every vision.

24. For there shall be no longer any vain vision or deceptive divination within the house of Israel.

25. For I am Jehovah; I speak, and the word which I speak shall come to pass; it shall no more be delayed. In your own days, ye rebellious house, will I speak the word and perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

26. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

27. Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, "The vision which he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off."

28. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more; what I speak shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 13

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say to them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of Jehovah!

3. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

4. Thy prophets, O Israel, are like the foxes in the deserts.

5. Ye have not gone up into the breaches, nor built a wall around the house of Israel, to stand in battle in the day of Jehovah.

6. They see falsehood, and lying divination. They say, "Jehovah hath spoken," when Jehovah hath not sent them; and they cause men to hope for the fulfilment of the word.

7. Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, and said, "Jehovah hath spoken," when I have not spoken?

8. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood and have seen a lie, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.

9. My hand shall be against the prophets that see falsehood and divine lies. They shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

10. Because, yea, because they seduce my people, and say, "Peace!" when there is no peace; and one buildeth up a wall, and, behold, they daub it with untempered mortar;

11. say to them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall; there shall be an overflowing shower, and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall rend it.

12. So when the wall is fallen, shall not men say to you, "Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?"

13. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury, and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.

14. Thus I will break down the wall which ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and will bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered; it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.

15. Thus will I accomplish my fury upon the wall, and upon them that daubed it with untempered mortar; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor they that daubed it;

16. even the prophets of Israel, who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.

17. Likewise, son of man, set thou thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them.

18. And say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew cushions for all elbows, and make pillows for heads of every stature, to ensnare men to destruction! Will ye hunt the lives of my people, and shall ye save your own?

19. And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley, and for pieces of bread, slaying them that should not die, and saving them alive that should not live, by lying to my people, who hearken to your lies?

20. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will set myself against the cushions with which ye ensnare men to destruction, so that they shall escape you; and I will tear them from your arms, and make them free whom ye would ensnare, so that they shall escape you.

21. Your pillows also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be ensnared, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

22. Because with lies ye have made sad the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life;

23. therefore shall ye no more see falsehood, nor divine divinations; but I will deliver my people out of your hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 14

1. Now certain men of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me.

2. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

3. Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and have put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face; shall I hear them when they inquire of me?

4. Therefore speak with them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet,—I, Jehovah, will answer him according to the multitude of his idols;

5. that I may lay hold of the house of Israel in their hearts, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

6. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Turn ye, even turn yourselves from your idols, and from all your abominations turn ye your faces!

7. For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire of me through him,—I, Jehovah, will answer him by myself.

8. And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

9. And when the prophet is deceived when he speaketh anything, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet; and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

10. And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that inquireth of him;

11. that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.

12. Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

13. Son of man, when a land sinneth against me, and grievously transgresseth, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break the staff of its bread, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,

14. though these three men were in it, Noah, Daniel, and Job, they should deliver only themselves by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.

15. When I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, and it be desolate so that none passeth through it because of the beasts,

16. though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.

17. Or when I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land so that I cut off from it man and beast,

18. though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.

19. Or when I send a pestilence upon that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast,

20. though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should deliver only themselves by their righteousness.

21. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more, when I send my four grievous judgments against Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the wild beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

22. Yet behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come forth to you, and ye shall see their way and their doings, and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil which I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all which I have brought upon her.

23. They shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings; and ye shall know that not without cause I have done all that I have done to her, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 15

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, what is the wood of the vine more than any wood,—a branch, that is among the trees of the forest?

3. Shall wood be taken from it to be wrought into any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang a vessel upon?

4. Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the middle of it is burned. Is it then fit for any work?

5. Behold, when it was whole, nothing could be made of it; how much less can anything be made of it when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned!

6. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give to it the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

7. And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.

8. And I will make the land desolate, because they have grievously trespassed, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 16

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

3. and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem: Thine origin and thy nativity were of the land of Canaan. Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.

4. And as to thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water so as to be cleansed. Thou wast not sprinkled with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling-clothes.

5. No eye pitied thee, to do to thee any of these things, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out into the open field, so as to loathe thyself, on the day thou wast born.

6. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee in danger of being trodden under foot in thy blood, I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live! yea, I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live!

7. I caused thee to increase like the plant of the field, and thou didst grow, and become tall, and didst attain to distinguished charms. Thy breasts swelled, and thy hair grew, whereas thou wast naked and bare.

8. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee, behold, it was thy time, the time of love. And I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness; and I swore to thee, and entered into covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine.

9. Then I washed thee with water, yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

10. I clothed thee also with broidered work, and gave thee shoes of seal’s skin, and wrapped thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.

11. And I decked thee with ornaments, and put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain upon thy neck.

12. And I put a jewel in thy nostril, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.

13. Thus wast thou adorned with gold and silver, and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work. Fine flour and honey and oil didst thou eat; and thou wast exceedingly beautiful, and didst prosper so as to become a queen.

14. And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.

15. But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst play the harlot because of thy renown, and didst lavish thy fornications on every one that passed by; his was it.

16. And of thy garments thou didst take, and didst make thee high places, spread with divers colors, and didst play the harlot thereon, the like things to which shall not come to pass, neither shall they be.

17. Thou didst take also thy fair jewels of my gold and my silver, which I gave thee, and didst make to thyself images of men, and didst commit fornication with them;

18. and thou didst take thy broidered garments and cover them; and thou didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.

19. My food also, which I gave thee, fine flour and oil and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst set it before them with a sweet savor; even thus it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.

20. Moreover thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou didst bear to me, and these didst thou sacrifice to them to be devoured. Was it not enough for thee to commit fornication,

21. that thou didst slay my children, and deliver them up to cause them to pass through the fire to them?

22. And in all thine abominations and thy fornications, thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and in danger of being trampled under foot in thy blood.

23. And it came to pass, after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe to thee! saith the Lord Jehovah,)

24. that thou didst build for thee an arched place, and make thee a high place in every street;

25. at every head of the way didst thou build thy high place, and didst make thy beauty to be abhorred, and didst open thy feet to every one that passed by, and didst multiply thy fornications.

26. Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, having great members, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me to anger.

27. Therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against thee, and have diminished thine allowance, and delivered thee to the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.

28. Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldst not be satisfied.

29. Thou hast also multiplied thy fornication with the land of Canaan, even to Chaldaea; and yet wast thou not satisfied therewith.

30. How faint was thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, that thou didst all those things which an imperious whorish wife doeth,

31. in that thou didst build thine arched place at the head of every way, and make thy high place in every street! Thou wast not like a harlot, who scoffeth at her hire,

32. but as an adulterous wife, that taketh strangers instead of her husband.

33. To all women that commit fornication men give a reward; but thou gavest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hiredst them to come to thee from every side to commit fornication with thee.

34. Thou wast the reverse of other women in thy fornications. None followed after thee to commit fornication, but thou gavest the reward, and no reward was given thee,—therefore thou wast the reverse.

35. Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah!

36. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy treasure was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered for fornication before thy lovers, and all thine abominable idols, and because of the blood of thy children, which thou didst give to them,

37. therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers, to whom thou wast pleasing, all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated, I will gather them against thee round about, and will uncover thy nakedness to them, that they may see all thy nakedness.

38. And I will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged, and I will cause thy blood to flow in fury and jealousy.

39. And I will give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine arched place, and break down thy high places. They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and leave thee naked and bare.

40. They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords;

41. and they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt give hire no more.

42. So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.

43. Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah, so that thou shalt not commit this wickedness in addition to all thy abominations.

44. Behold, all they that use proverbs shall utter this proverb concerning thee: "As the mother, so the daughter."

45. Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loathed her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, that loathed their husbands and their children; your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

46. And thine elder sister is Samaria, with her daughters, that dwelleth at thy left hand; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom, with her daughters.

47. Yet thou hast not walked in their ways, nor done according to their abominations: that was disdained by you, as a very little thing; thou hast been more corrupt than they in all thy ways.

48. As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom, thy sister, hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.

49. Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom, thy sister: in pride, superabundance, and careless ease did she live, she and her daughters, and the hand of the poor and needy she did not strengthen;

50. and they were haughty, and committed abomination before me; therefore I took them away when I saw it.

51. Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.

52. Now, therefore, bear thou thy shame, to which thou hast condemned thy sisters, since by thy sins which thou hast committed, more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou. Yea, be thou confounded and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.

53. Yet I will bring them back from their captivity, even Sodom and her daughters from their captivity, and Samaria and her daughters from their captivity; thee also will I bring back from thy captivity in the midst of them;

54. that thou mayst bear thy shame, and mayst be confounded on account of all which thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort to them.

55. And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.

56. And yet Sodom, thy sister, was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride

57. before thy wickedness was discovered, as in the time of thy reproach from the daughters of Syria, and from all that were round about her, and from the daughters of the Philistines, who despised thee round about.

58. Thy wickedness and thine abominations must thou now bear, saith the Lord Jehovah.

59. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will do to thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath and hast broken the covenant.

60. But I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.

61. Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger, and I shall give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy observance of thy covenant.

62. But I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;

63. that thou mayst remember and be confounded, and not open thy mouth any more for shame, when I forgive thee all which thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 17

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;

3. and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle, with great wings, with long feathers, full of plumage, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of a cedar.

4. He cropped off the top of its young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.

5. He took also one of the shoots of the land, and put it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow-tree.

6. And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned towards him, and whose roots were under him. It became a vine, that brought forth branches, and shot forth boughs.

7. There was also another great eagle, with great wings and many feathers; and, behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, that he might water it from the beds where it was planted.

8. And yet it was planted in a good soil, by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, and be a goodly vine.

9. Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? Shall not he pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it wither? In all the leaves of its branching shall it wither; even without a mighty arm, or many people, shall he pluck it up by the roots.

10. Yea, behold, it is planted; but shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.

11. Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

12. Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? Say, behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes, and led them with him to Babylon,

13. and took one of the king’s offspring, and made a covenant with him, and took an oath of him, and the mighty of the land he took away,

14. that the kingdom might be brought low, so as not to lift itself up; that the covenant might be kept, and stand.

15. But he rebelled against him, in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? Shall he escape that doeth such things? Shall he break the covenant and be delivered?

16. As I live saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon shall he die.

17. Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great multitude accomplish anything for him in war, when they shall cast up mounds, and build forts to cut off many persons,

18. he hath despised the oath, and broken the covenant; behold, he hath given the hand, and yet done all these things; he shall not escape!

19. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath, which he hath despised, and my covenant, which he hath broken, will I recompense upon his own head.

20. And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will contend with him there for his trespass which he hath committed against me.

21. And all his fugitives with all his hosts shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered to all the winds; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

22. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I also will take from the top of the high cedar, and will get it; and from the highest of its twigs will I crop a tender one, and plant it upon a high and lofty mountain.

23. Upon a high mountain of Israel will I plant it, and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar; and under it shall dwell birds of every wing; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.

24. And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree; that I have dried up the green tree, and made the dry tree green. I, Jehovah, have spoken, and will do it.

## Ezekiel 18

1. The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying:

2. What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge"?

3. As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.

4. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son, is mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die.

5. But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right;

6. if he eat not upon the mountains, and lift not up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and defile not his neighbor’s wife, and come not near a woman during her uncleanness;

7. if he oppress not any, if he restore to the debtor his pledge, spoil none by violence, give his bread to the hungry, and cover the naked with a garment;

8. if he give not forth upon usury, and take not increase; if he withdraw his hand from iniquity, and give true judgment between man and man;

9. if he walk in my statutes and keep my commandments, to deal uprightly,—he is just; he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.

10. But if he have a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth to his brother any of these things,

11. and doeth not all those duties, but eateth upon the mountains, and defileth his neighbor’s wife,

12. oppresseth the poor and needy, spoileth by violence, restoreth not the pledge, lifteth up his eyes to idols, and committeth abomination,

13. giveth forth upon usury, and taketh increase, shall he live? No! he shall not live. He hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.

14. Yet lo, if he have a son that seeth all the sins which his father committed, that seeth them and doeth not such like,

15. that eateth not upon the mountains, nor lifteth up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defileth his neighbor’s wife,

16. nor oppresseth any, nor taketh a pledge, nor spoileth by violence, but giveth his food to the hungry, and covereth the naked with a garment,

17. keepeth back his hand from the poor, and taketh no usury or increase, keepeth my commandments, and walketh in my statutes, he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live.

18. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, he shall die for his iniquity.

19. Yet say ye, "Why? Doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?" When the son doeth that which is lawful and right, keepeth all my statutes and doeth them, he shall surely live.

20. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.

21. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

22. None of his transgressions which he hath committed shall be remembered unto him; for his righteousness, which he hath done, he shall live.

23. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord Jehovah, and not that he should turn from his ways and live?

24. But when the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations which the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; for his trespass which he hath trespassed, and for his sin which he hath sinned, for them shall he die.

25. Yet ye say, "The way of the Lord is not right." Hear now, O house of Israel! "Is not my way right?" Is it not your ways that are not right?

26. When a righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and on this account dieth, for his iniquity which he hath done doth he die.

27. And when the wicked man turneth from his iniquity which he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.

28. Because he considereth and turneth from all his transgressions which he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

29. Yet saith the house of Israel, "The way of the Lord is not right." O house of Israel, are not my ways right? Is it not your ways that are not right?

30. Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Turn ye, turn yourselves from all your transgressions, so that iniquity may not be your ruin.

31. Cast away from you all your transgressions which ye have committed, and make you a new heart, and a new spirit! For why will ye die, O house of Israel?

32. For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah. Wherefore turn yourselves and live!

## Ezekiel 19

1. Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

2. and say:—How lay thy mother at ease, a lioness among lions! Among young lions she nourished her whelps;

3. And she brought up one of her whelps; He became a young lion, And he learned to seize the prey; he devoured men.

4. And when the nations heard of him, he was taken in their pit, And they brought him with nose-rings to the land of Egypt.

5. And when she saw that she waited in vain, and that her hope was lost, She took another of her whelps, and she made him a young lion.

6. And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, And he learned to seize the prey; he devoured men.

7. He knew their widows, and laid waste their cities, And the land was desolate, and all that was therein, before the voice of his roaring.

8. Then the nations set themselves against him on every side from the provinces, And spread their net over him; He was taken in their pit.

9. And they put him with nose rings into a cage, And carried him to the king of Babylon. And they carried him to a stronghold, That his voice might be heard no more Upon the mountains of Israel.

10. Thy mother was like a vine planted like thyself by the waters; She was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters;

11. She had strong rods for sceptres of rulers, And her stature was high among the thick branches, So that she was conspicuous in her height, And the multitude of her branches.

12. But she was plucked up in fury, She was cast down to the ground, And the east wind dried up her fruit. Her strong rods were broken and withered; The fire consumed them.

13. And now she is planted in the desert, In a dry and thirsty land.

14. And a fire is gone forth out of a rod of her branches, Which hath devoured her fruit, So that she hath no strong rod for a ruler’s sceptre. This is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.

## Ezekiel 20

1. And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.

2. Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying:

3. Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Are ye come to inquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.

4. Punish them, punish them, son of man, cause them to know the abominations of their fathers, and say to them,

5. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the time when I chose Israel, I lifted up my hand to the race of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt; I lifted up my hand to them, and said, I am Jehovah, your God.

6. At that time I lifted up my hand to them, that I would bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, into a land which I had looked out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands.

7. And I said to them, Cast ye away from you every one the abomination of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt! I am Jehovah, your God.

8. But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me; they did not cast away every one the abominations of his eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said that I would pour out my fury upon them, that I would accomplish mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

9. But I acted for my name’s sake, that it might not be polluted in the sight of the nations, in the midst of whom they were; and before their eyes I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

10. And I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and led them into the wilderness.

11. And I gave them my statutes, and made known to them my laws, through which the man that keepeth them shall live.

12. Also I gave them my sabbaths, that they might be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I, Jehovah, sanctify them.

13. But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the desert; they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my laws, through which the man that keepeth them shall live, and my sabbaths they greatly polluted. Then I said that I would pour out my fury upon them in the desert, to consume them.

14. But I acted for my name’s sake, that it might not be polluted before the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.

15. Yet I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the beauty of all lands;

16. because they despised my laws, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.

17. Nevertheless mine eye spared them, so that I did not destroy them; neither did I make an end of them in the desert.

18. And I said to their sons in the desert, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols!

19. I am Jehovah, your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them.

20. And hallow my sabbaths, that they may be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah, your God.

21. But the sons rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept they my ordinances to do them, through which the man that doeth them shall live, and they polluted my sabbaths. Then I said that I would pour out my fury upon them, and accomplish mine anger upon them in the desert.

22. Nevertheless I held back my hand, and acted for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.

23. I also lifted up my hand against them in the desert, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries,

24. because they did not observe mine ordinances, but despised my statutes, and polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after the idols of their fathers.

25. Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances by which they should not live.

26. And I polluted them in their offerings, in that they caused every first-born child to pass through the fire, that I might destroy them, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.

27. Therefore speak to the house of Israel, O son of man, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers dishonored me, and trespassed against me.

28. For when I had brought them into the land concerning which I lifted up my hand, that I would give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick tree’s, and there they offered their sacrifices, and there they presented their provoking oblation, and there they brought their sweet savor, and there they poured out their drink-offerings.

29. Then I said to them, What is the high place to which ye go? And it is called The High Place unto this day.

30. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers, and do ye commit fornication according to their abominations,

31. and by offering your gifts, and causing your sons to pass through the fire,—are ye polluted with all your idols even to this day, and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you!

32. And that which cometh into your mind shall not come to pass, when ye say, "We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, worshipping wood and stone."

33. As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out will I rule over you.

34. And I will bring you forth from the nations, and gather you from the countries, wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

35. And I will bring you into the desert of the nations, and there will I contend with you face to face.

36. Even as I contended with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so also will I contend with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.

37. And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.

38. And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; out of the country where they sojourn will I bring them forth, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

39. As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve ye every one his idols in future also, if ye will not obey me! But pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and your idols!

40. For upon my holy mountain, upon the lofty mountain of Israel, there shall all the house of Israel, all that are in the land, serve me; there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all things which ye consecrate to me.

41. I will accept you as a sweet savor, when I bring you forth from the nations, and gather you from the countries, wherein ye have been scattered, and will through you be honored before the eyes of the nations.

42. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country concerning which I lifted up my hand, that I would give it to your fathers.

43. And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been polluted; and ye shall loathe yourselves for all your evil deeds which ye have committed.

44. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I deal with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.

45. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

46. Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word against the South, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;

47. and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle in thee a fire, which shall devour every green tree and every dry tree within thee; the fierce flame shall not be quenched, and all parts from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

48. And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.

49. And I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah, they say of me, "Doth he not speak in parables?"

## Ezekiel 21

1. Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying:

2. Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,

3. and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.

4. Seeing then that I cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.

5. And all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.

6. Thou, therefore, O son of man, sigh! With the breaking of thy loins, and with bitterness, sigh before their eyes!

7. And when they shall say to thee, "Wherefore sighest thou?" thou shalt say, "For the rumor, because it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall fail, and all knees shall flow with water. Behold it cometh, it shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord Jehovah."

8. Also the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

9. Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, The sword, the sword is sharpened and furbished.

10. It is sharpened, that it may make sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter. Or shall we make mirth? The staff of my son despiseth every rod.

11. And he gave it to be furbished that it might be handled. The sword is sharpened and furbished, to be given into the hand of the slayer.

12. Cry and howl, son of man! for it cometh upon my people, upon all the princes of Israel. They are given up to the sword with my people. Therefore smite upon thy thigh.

13. The trial is made. And what if even the contemning staff should be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.

14. Thou, therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together! for twice, yea thrice, cometh the sword, a sword of slaughter, a sword of great slaughter, that besetteth them on every side.

15. That their hearts may faint, and their overthrown may be multiplied, I have set the terror of the sword against all their gates. Ah, how is it made to glitter, polished for slaughter!

16. Unite thyself, smite to the right, prepare thyself, smite to the left, whithersoever thine edge is turned!

17. I also will smite my hands together, and cause mine anger to cease. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

18. The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying:

19. Do thou, son of man, appoint thee two ways by which the sword of the king of Babylon may come; from one land shall both of them come; and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.

20. Appoint a way, that the sword may come towards Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and towards Judah, to Jerusalem, the fenced city.

21. For the king of Babylon shall stand at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shall shake together his arrows, he shall consult the teraphim, he shall look at the liver.

22. In his right hand shall be the lot: Jerusalem, to set battering-rams, to open the mouth with the war-cry, to lift up the voice in shouting, to set battering-rams against the gates, to cast up a mound, to build a tower.

23. And this shall appear a false divination in their sight, because they swore oaths to them. But he shall call to remembrance their iniquity, that they may be taken.

24. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye make your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear,—because, I say, ye bring yourselves into remembrance, ye shall be taken with that hand.

25. And thou, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day cometh in the time when iniquity bringeth destruction!

26. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will remove the diadem, and take away the crown! This shall no more be this. I exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.

27. I will destroy, destroy, destroy it; and it shall be no more until he come to whom the right belongeth, and to whom I will give it.

28. And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the sons of Ammon and their scorn; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn; to slay, to consume, is it furbished, so that it glittereth;

29. while they see deceit for thee, and prophesy falsehood, that it may bring thee to the necks of the wicked that are slain, whose day cometh in the time when iniquity bringeth destruction.

30. Return the sword into its sheath! In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity, I will judge thee,

31. and I will pour upon thee my indignation, I will blow upon thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hands of brutal men, skilful to destroy.

32. Thou shalt be fuel for the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; men shall no more remember thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 22

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Punish, punish, son of man, the city of blood, and show her all her abominations, and say,

3. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O city that sheddest blood in the midst of thee, that thy time may come, and makest idols to defile thyself!

4. Through the blood which thou sheddest thou bringest guilt upon thyself, and through the idols which thou makest thou pollutest thyself, and thou causest thy days to draw near, and comest to thy years. Therefore do I make thee a reproach to the nations, and a derision to all countries.

5. Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee as infamous, full of confusion.

6. Behold the princes of Israel are engaged every one according to his strength within thee to shed blood.

7. In thee they set light by father and mother; in thee are they guilty of oppression to the stranger; in thee do they oppress the fatherless and the widow.

8. Thou hast despised my holy things, and profaned my sabbaths.

9. In thee are men who carry tales, that they may shed blood; in thee do they eat upon the mountains; in the midst of thee do they commit lewdness.

10. In thee doth the son uncover the father’s nakedness; in thee do they lie with a woman in her uncleanness.

11. And one committeth abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another, with incestuous lewdness, defileth his daughter-in-law; and in thee another lieth with his sister, his father’s daughter.

12. In thee do they take a reward to shed blood. Thou takest usury and increase, and thou hast enriched thyself from thy neighbor by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord Jehovah.

13. Therefore, behold, I have smitten my hands together at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at the blood which hath been shed in the midst of thee.

14. Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the day when I shall deal with thee? I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and will do it.

15. I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thine impurity out of thee;

16. and thou shalt through thyself be profaned before the eyes of the nations, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.

17. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

18. Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross to me; all of them are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.

19. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all of you become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

20. As men gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it, so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will place you there and melt you.

21. Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.

22. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my fury upon you.

23. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

24. Son of man, say to her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

25. There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her; like a roaring lion tearing the prey, they devour the lives of men; they take possession of treasures, and precious things, and make many widows in the midst of her.

26. Her priests violate my law, and profane my holy things. They make no distinction between the holy and profane, and show not the difference between the clean and the unclean; and they hide their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

27. Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves tearing the prey. They shed blood, they destroy life, that they may get gain.

28. Her prophets daub for them with untempered mortar, seeing falsehood, and divining to them, saying, "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah," when Jehovah hath not spoken.

29. The people of the land are guilty of oppression, and practise robbery, and distress the poor and needy; yea, they oppress the stranger, and have no justice.

30. I have sought for a man among them that should make a wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I might not destroy it; but I found none.

31. Therefore will I pour out my indignation upon them; I will consume them with the fire of my wrath; I will bring their way upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 23

1. The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying:

2. Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother;

3. and they committed fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committed fornication. There they allowed their breasts to be pressed, and their virgin teats to be handled.

4. Their names were Aholah, the elder, and Aholibah, her sister; and they became mine, and bore sons and daughters; as to their names, moreover, Aholah is Samaria, and Aholibah, Jerusalem.

5. And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians, her neighbors

6. who were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen, riding on horses.

7. Thus she committed fornication with them, with all the choice young men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted; with all their idols she defiled herself.

8. Neither forsook she her whoredoms brought from Egypt; for they lay with her in her youth, and handled the breasts of her virginity, and poured their fornication upon her.

9. Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

10. These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword; and she became famous among women, when they had executed judgment upon her.

11. And her sister, Aholibah, saw this, but she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.

12. She doted upon the Assyrians, her neighbors, prefects and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.

13. Then I saw that she was defiled; that they both took one way.

14. But she added to her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, images of Chaldaeans portrayed with vermilion,

15. girded with girdles upon their loins, and having long mitres hanging down from their heads, in their appearance all of them princes, after the manner of the sons of Babylon, of Chaldaea, the land of their nativity;

16. and as soon as she cast her eyes upon them, she doted on them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldaea.

17. And the sons of Babylon came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredoms, and she was polluted with them. She then became alienated from them.

18. So she discovered her fornications, and discovered her nakedness. Then my mind was alienated from her, as it had been alienated from her sister.

19. For she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she played the harlot in the land of Egypt;

20. for she doted on their paramours, whose members were as the members of asses, and whose issue was as the issue of horses.

21. Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, when thy teats were handled by the Egyptians, on account of the paps of thy youth.

22. Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against thee thy lovers, from whom thou art alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side,

23. the Babylonians and all the Chaldaeans, prefects, rich men, and nobles, and all the Assyrians with them, all of them desirable young men, prefects and rulers, captains and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.

24. And they shall come against thee with arms, chariots and wheels, and with hosts of people; with buckler and shield and helmet shall they set themselves against thee on every side. And I will commit to them judgment, and they shall punish thee according to their punishments.

25. And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy posterity shall fall by the sword. They shall take away thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be consumed with fire.

26. They shall also strip thee of thy garments, and take away thy fair jewels.

27. Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt, so that thou shalt not lift thine eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.

28. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thou art alienated.

29. And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and take away all the fruits of thy labor from thee, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and thy nakedness shall be uncovered, with which thou hast committed lewdness and fornication and foul whoredom.

30. These things will I do to thee, because thou hast committed whoredom with the nations, and hast been polluted with their idols.

31. Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.

32. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup, which is deep and large; it shall make thee a laughing-stock and a derision, for it containeth much.

33. Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of astonishment and amazement is the cup of thy sister Samaria.

34. Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and lick the sherds, and thou shalt tear thy breasts. For I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

35. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

36. Moreover, Jehovah said to me, Son of man, punish Aholah and Aholibah; yea, declare to them their abominations;

37. that they have committed adultery, and blood is upon their hands, and that with their idols they have committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them for food.

38. This also have they done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

39. For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came into my sanctuary the same day to profane it; behold, thus have they done in my house.

40. Yea, ye sent for men to come from afar; messengers were sent to them, and behold, they came; for them didst thou wash thyself, and paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments.

41. And thou didst seat thyself upon a stately bed before which a table was prepared, and thereon didst thou set my incense and my oil.

42. Also the voice of a multitude at ease was with her; and together with men from the common multitude were brought deep-drinkers from the desert, who put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.

43. Then said I concerning her that was worn out with adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, even with her?

44. They went in to her, as men go to a harlot; so went they in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the lewd women.

45. But righteous men shall judge them, as adulteresses are judged, and as women that shed blood are judged; for they are adulteresses, and blood is upon their hands.

46. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring a great company against them, and will give them up to be harassed and spoiled,

47. and the company shall stone them with stones, and cut them in pieces with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.

48. Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may take warning, and not follow them in their lewdness.

49. And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; that ye may know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 24

1. Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, and said:

2. Son of man, write the name of the day, even of this same day. The king of Babylon draweth near to Jerusalem this same day.

3. Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Set on a caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it.

4. Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

5. Take the choice of the flock, and make under it a pile for the bones, and make it boil well, that the bones therein may be seethed.

6. Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the city of blood, to the caldron in which is rust, and whose rust goeth not out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

7. For blood is in the midst of her; upon the bare rock hath she shed it; she poured it not upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust.

8. To cause fury and to take vengeance, I have set the blood shed by her upon the bare rock, that it might not be covered.

9. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the city of blood! Now will I make the pile for fire great.

10. Heap on wood, kindle the fire, cook the flesh, put in spices, and let the bones be burned.

11. Then set it empty upon the coals, that its brass may be hot and may burn, and that its impurity may be dissolved in it, and its rust be consumed.

12. It hath wearied me with labors, yet its thick rust goeth not from it; its rust remaineth in the midst of the fire.

13. In thy filthiness is gross wickedness, because, when I would have cleansed thee, thou wouldst not be cleansed. Thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have quieted my fury toward thee.

14. I, Jehovah, have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it. I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent. According to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.

15. Also the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

16. Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with one blow; yet thou shalt not mourn, nor weep, nor shall thy tears run down.

17. Sigh thou in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy head-dress upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet; cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of wretched men.

18. So I spake to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

19. And the people said to me, Wilt thou not tell us what those things which thou doest denote to us?

20. Then I answered them: The word of Jehovah came to me and said:

21. Say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your confidence, the desire of your eyes, and the longing of your souls; and your sons and daughters that are left to you shall fall by the sword.

22. And ye shall do as I have done; ye shall not cover your mouths, nor eat the bread of wretched men;

23. and your head-dresses shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet; ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and moan one to another.

24. Thus Ezekiel shall be to you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do, when this cometh; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

25. And thou, son of man, behold, in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the longing of their souls, their sons and their daughters, in that day shall one

26. that is escaped come to thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears.

27. In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb; and thou shalt be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 25

1. The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:

2. Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;

3. and say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou saidst, "Aha!" against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity, therefore,

4. behold, I will deliver thee to the sons of the East for a possession, and they shall set their folds in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.

5. And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the land of the Ammonites a couching-place for flocks; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

6. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with thy feet, and rejoiced with all thy despite from the heart, against the land of Israel,

7. therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; I will cut thee off from the nations, and cause thee to perish from the countries; I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.

8. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir say, "Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,"

9. therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from his cities, which are on his borders, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.

10. To the sons of the East will I give it for a possession, together with the sons of Ammon, that the sons of Ammon may be no more remembered among the nations;

11. and on Moab will I execute judgments, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

12. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them,

13. therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off from it man and beast; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.

14. And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall deal with Edom according to mine anger, and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.

15. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt with revenge, and have taken vengeance, with a despiteful heart, even to destruction, from the old hatred;

16. therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant upon the sea-coasts.

17. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah when I lay my vengeance upon them.

## Ezekiel 26

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the word bf Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, because Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, "Aha! she is broken that was the gate of the nations; now is all transferred to me; I shall be full, now that she is desolate!"

3. therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and I will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.

4. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers; and I will scrape off her earth from her, and make her like a naked rock.

5. She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah. And she shall be to the nations for a spoil;

6. and her daughters that are upon the land shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

7. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, a king of kings from the North, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a vast multitude of people.

8. Thy daughters upon the land shall he slay with the sword; and he shall set a tower against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee;

9. and his battering-rams shall be set against thy walls, and thy towers shall he break down with axes.

10. By reason of the great number of his horses, their dust shall cover thee; thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he entereth into thy gates, as men enter into a city that is broken through.

11. With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; thy people he shall slay with the sword; and the idols of thy strength shall fall to the ground.

12. And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy beautiful houses; and thy stones and thy timber and thine earth shall they lay in the midst of the waters.

13. And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

14. And I will make thee like a naked rock; thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more; for I, Jehovah, have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

15. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Behold, the isles shall shake at the sound of thy fall, at the groaning of the wounded, and at the slaughter which is made in the midst of thee.

16. And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their mantles, and put off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling, and sit on the ground, and tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee.

17. And they shall utter a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, "How art thou destroyed, thou that wast peopled from the seas, the renowned city, that wast mighty upon the sea, thou and thine inhabitants, causing terror to all that dwelt near thee!"

18. Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall quake at thy departure.

19. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee,

20. I will bring thee down to them that have gone down to the pit, to the people of old time, and I will cause thee to dwell in the lower parts of the earth, amid the ruins of ancient times, with them that have gone down to the pit, that thou be no more inhabited; but I will set glory in the land of the living.

21. I will make thee a desolation, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, thou shalt be found no more forever, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 27

1. The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:

2. Son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre,

3. and say to Tyre, O thou that didst dwell at the entrance of the sea, the merchant of the nations to many coasts! thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, thou hast said, "I am perfect in beauty."

4. Thy borders are in the midst of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty.

5. They made all thy ship-boards of cypresses of Senir; they took cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

6. Of oaks of Bashan they made thine oars; thy benches they made of ivory inlaid in cedar from the coasts of the Chittaeans.

7. Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou didst spread forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the coasts of Elisha were thy covering.

8. The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

9. The ancients of Gebal and the skilful men thereof were in thee, thy calkers; all the ships of the sea, with their mariners, were in thee, to traffic in thy merchandise.

10. Persians, and Lydians, and Lybians were in thine army, thy men of war; they hung up the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy glory.

11. The men of Arvad and thine own army were upon thy walls round about, and brave warriors were in thy towers; they hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they made thy beauty perfect.

12. Tarshish trafficked with thee on account of the abundance of all kinds of goods; with silver, iron, tin, and lead they traded in thy fairs.

13. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech trafficked with thee; the persons of men and vessels of brass they sold in thy market.

14. They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.

15. The men of Dedan trafficked with thee; many islands were at hand to thee for trade; they brought thee, for payment, horns of ivory, and ebony-wood.

16. Syria trafficked with thee by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making; with carbuncles, purple and embroidered work, and fine linen, and corals, and rubies, they traded in thy fairs.

17. Judah and the land of Israel trafficked with thee; with wheat of Minnith, and pastry, and syrup, and oil, and balm they traded in thy market.

18. Damascus trafficked with thee on account of the multitude of the wares of thy making, on account of the abundance of all kinds of goods, in the wine of Helbon, and in white wool.

19. Vedan and Javan brought thread to thy market; wrought iron, cassia, and sweet reed were in thy fairs.

20. Dedan brought cloth for riding, in traffic with thee.

21. Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were at hand to traffic with thee; they traded with thee in lambs and rams and goats.

22. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah trafficked with thee with all kinds of precious spices, and with all kinds of precious stones, and gold.

23. Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assyria, and Chilmad,

24. trafficked with thee in splendid apparel, in mantles of blue and embroidered work, in chests of damask bound with cords and made of cedar, in thy market.

25. The ships of Tarshish were the caravans for thy traffic; and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.

26. Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.

27. Thy riches, and thy fairs, and thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the traders in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war within thee, and all thy multitude that is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

28. At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the pastures around thee shall shake.

29. And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,

30. and shall cause their voice to be heard for thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast dust upon their heads, and roll themselves in ashes.

31. And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth; and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.

32. And in their wailing they shall take up for thee a lamentation, and shall lament over thee, saying: "What city is like Tyre, like the Destroyed in the midst of the sea?

33. When thy wares went forth from the seas, thou didst satisfy many nations; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the abundance of thy riches and thy merchandise.

34. Now thou art broken by the seas in the depth of the waters, and thy merchandise and all thy multitude in the midst of thee are fallen.

35. All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings shudder; they are troubled in their countenance.

36. The merchants among the nations hiss at thee. Thou art a desolation, and shalt exist no more forever."

## Ezekiel 28

1. The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:

2. Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, "I am a god, I sit in the seat of a god, in the midst of the seas"; and though thou art man, not God, yet settest thy heart as the heart of a god,—

3. behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret which can be hidden from thee;

4. by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver in thy treasures;

5. by thy great wisdom, by thy traffic, thou hast increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy wealth,—

6. therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou settest thy heart as the heart of a god, therefore,

7. behold, I will bring upon thee strangers, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.

8. They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the death of the slain, in the midst of the seas.

9. Wilt thou yet say, "I am a god," before him that slayeth thee? Thou shalt be man, and not God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.

10. Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised, by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

11. Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

12. Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:—Thou wast a finished signet, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty;

13. In Eden, the garden of God, thou didst dwell; Every precious stone was thy covering, The ruby, the topaz, and the diamond, The chrysolite, the onyx, and the jasper, The sapphire, the carbuncle, and the emerald, and gold. The workmanship of thy jewel-holes was within thee; On the day when thou wast born were they prepared.

14. Thou wast an outspread, covering cherub; I set thee upon the holy mountain of God; Thou didst walk in the midst of the stones of fire.

15. Thou wast prosperous in thy ways from the day that thou wast born Until iniquity was found in thee.

16. Through the abundance of thy merchandise thou art full of injustice; And thou hast sinned; Therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God, And I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

17. Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; Thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy splendor; I will cast thee to the ground; I will give thee up to kings to be their gazing-stock.

18. By the multitude of thine iniquities, by the unrighteousness of thy traffic, Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries. Therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, which shall devour thee, And I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, In the sight of all them that behold thee.

19. All they that know thee among the nations shall be astonished at thee; Thou art become a desolation, and shalt exist no more forever.

20. Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

21. Son of man, set thy face against Sidon, and prophesy against her,

22. and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon, and I will be glorified in the midst of thee, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I execute judgments in her, and am sanctified in her.

23. I will send upon her pestilence, and blood into her streets, and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her by the sword which is against her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

24. And there shall be no more to the house of Israel a pricking brier, or a grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

25. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall gather the house of Israel from the nations among which they are scattered, then shall I be sanctified through them in the sight of the nations, and they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob.

26. They shall dwell therein securely, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards, yea, they shall dwell securely when I have executed judgments on all that despised them round about; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, their God.

## Ezekiel 29

1. In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;

3. Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, thou great dragon, that liest in the midst of thy rivers, and sayest, "My river is my own, and I have made it for myself."

4. And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to cleave to thy scales, and I will draw thee forth from the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers which cleave to thy scales.

5. And I will cast thee into the desert, thee and all the fish of thy rivers; thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; to the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven I have given thee for food.

6. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah; because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

7. When they took hold of thee by thy handle, thou didst break and pierce their whole shoulder; and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst go to pieces, and madest all their loins to shake.

8. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee;

9. and the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he hath said, "The river is mine, and I have made it."

10. Therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers; and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol even to Syene, and to the borders of Ethiopia.

11. There shall not pass through it the foot of man, and the foot of beast shall not pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

12. I will make the land of Egypt desolate amidst the lands that are desolate, and her cities, among the cities that are laid waste, shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

13. Yet thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the nations whither they are scattered;

14. and I will bring back the captives of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their origin; and they shall be there a mean kingdom;

15. it shall be the meanest of all kingdoms; it shall no more exalt itself above the nations; for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.

16. And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to my remembrance their iniquity in looking to them for help; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

17. And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

18. Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled; yet neither he nor his army had wages from Tyre for the service which he served against it.

19. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her plunder; and it shall be wages for his army.

20. For his wages for his service I will give him the land of Egypt; for they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.

21. In that day will I cause a horn to grow forth to the house of Israel, and I will give thee to open the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 30

1. The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:

2. Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Howl ye, Alas! alas for the day!

3. For the day is near, the day of Jehovah is near! A day of clouds, the time of the nations is come.

4. The sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be destroyed.

5. Ethiopia, and Lybia, and Lydia, and all her auxiliaries, and Chub, and the men of every country that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.

6. Thus saith Jehovah: They that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down; from Migdol to Syene shall they fall in her by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.

7. And they shall be laid waste in the midst of the lands that are laid waste, and her cities shall be amongst the cities that are desolate.

8. And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have brought a fire into Egypt, and all her helpers shall be destroyed.

9. In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships, to make the confident Ethiopians afraid; and anguish shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for behold, it cometh!

10. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.

11. He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to make the land desolate; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

12. And I will make the rivers dry, and I will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will lay waste the land and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers; I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

13. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will destroy the idols, and cause the images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt; and I will bring fear upon the land of Egypt:

14. And I will lay waste Pathros, and bring a fire upon Zoan, and execute judgments upon No.

15. And I will pour out my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt, and I will cut off the multitude of No.

16. And I will bring a fire upon Egypt; Sin shall tremble, and No shall be broken through, and Noph shall be plundered by day.

17. The young men of On and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword, and the women shall go into captivity.

18. At Tahpanhes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yoke of Egypt, and the pride of her strength shall cease within her. A cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.

19. Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

20. Now it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

21. Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and lo, it is not bound up, so as to have medicines applied to it; a bandage is not applied to it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

22. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt; and I will break his arms, both the strong one, and that which was broken, and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

23. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.

24. But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword into his hand, and break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.

25. Yea, I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

26. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 31

1. Now it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his multitude: To whom art thou like in thy greatness?

3. Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar upon Lebanon, with fair branches; An overshadowing thicket, high of stature; And his top was among thick boughs.

4. The waters made him great; the deep waters made him high; Their streams went around their plantation, And sent forth their channels to all the trees of the field.

5. Therefore his height was exalted Above all the trees of the field. And his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long, Because of the abundance of water when he shot forth.

6. In his boughs all the birds of heaven made their nests, And under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; And under his shadow dwelt all the great nations.

7. Thus was he beautiful in his greatness, in the length of his branches; For his root was by many waters.

8. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him; The cypress-trees were not like his boughs, And the plane-trees were not like his branches. Not any tree in the garden of God Was like to him in his beauty.

9. I made him beautiful in the multitude of his branches, So that all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God, envied him.

10. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because he lifted himself up in stature, And shot up his top among the thick boughs, And his heart was lifted up on account of his height,

11. Therefore I delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations, To deal hardly with him; I drave him out for his wickedness;

12. And strangers, the terrible of the nations, cut him off and cast him away. Upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches fell; And his boughs were broken in all the valleys of the land. And all the nations of the earth withdrew from his shadow and left him;

13. Upon his ruin dwelt all the birds of the heavens, And upon his branches were all the beasts of the forest.

14. To the end that none of all the trees by the waters Might exalt themselves for their stature, Nor shoot up their top among the thick boughs, And that none of the trees that drink water should cleave to them on account of their height; For all of them are delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, In the midst of the sons of men, To them that have gone down to the pit.

15. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to the grave, I caused the deep to mourn, I covered it for him; I restrained on account of him the streams, and the great waters were kept back; And I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, And all the trees of the field fainted for him.

16. At the sound of his fall I made the nations to shake, When I cast him down to the grave, To them that have gone down to the pit; And all the trees of Eden, The choice and best of Lebanon, Even all that drink water, Were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.

17. They also went down into the grave with him, To them that have been slain with the sword; They also that were his arm, That dwelt under his shadow among the nations.

18. To whom art thou thus like in glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? Thou shalt be brought down with the trees of Eden To the lower parts of the earth; Thou shalt lie down in the midst of the uncircumcised, With them that are slain by the sword. Thus shall it be with Pharaoh and all his multitude, Saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 32

1. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and say to him:—Thou art like a young lion among the nations; Thou art like a dragon in the seas; And thou camest forth into thy rivers, And troubledst the waters with thy feet, And didst disturb their rivers.

3. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will therefore spread my net over thee, Amidst an assembly of many nations; And they shall draw thee up in my net.

4. And I will throw thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, And I will cause all the birds of heaven to remain upon thee. And I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee;

5. And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, And fill the valleys with thy heaps.

6. And I will water the land in which thou swimmest with thy blood, even to the mountains, And the streams shall be full of thee.

7. And I will cover the heavens, when I quench thee, And make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, And the moon shall not give her light.

8. All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, And bring darkness upon thy land, Saith the Lord Jehovah.

9. And I will grieve the hearts of many nations, When I bring thy destruction among the nations, In lands which thou knowest not.

10. Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, And their kings shall shudder on account of thee, When I brandish my sword before them; And they shall tremble every moment, every one for his life, in the day of thy fall.

11. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee;

12. By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, All of them the terrible of the nations. And they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, And all her multitude shall be destroyed.

13. I will also destroy all her beasts From beside the great waters; Neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, Nor shall the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

14. Then will I make their waters clear, And cause their rivers to run like oil, Saith the Lord Jehovah,

15. When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, And the country shall be destitute of all that was therein, When I shall smite all that dwell therein, That they may know that I am Jehovah.

16. This is the lamentation which they shall utter; the daughters of the nations shall utter it. For Egypt and for all her multitude shall they utter it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

17. It came to pass also in the twelfth year, [in the twelfth month,] on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

18. Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast her down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, to them that have gone down to the pit.

19. Art thou more beautiful than another? Come down and be laid with the uncircumcised!

20. They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword. The sword is given; drag her away and all her multitudes!

21. The mightiest heroes from the midst of the pit shall speak to him and his helpers; For they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

22. There is Assyria and all her company; Her graves are round about her; All of them are slain, fallen by the sword;

23. Her grave is made in the depths of the pit, And her company is round about her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword, They who caused terror in the land of the living.

24. There is Elam and all her company round about her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword; They are gone down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, Who caused terror in the land of the living; They bear their shame with them that have gone down to the pit.

25. Among the slain have they set her a bed with all her multitude; Her graves are round about her, All of them slain, uncircumcised, by the sword. Though they caused terror in the land of the living, Yet they bear their shame with them that have gone down to the pit; They are laid in the midst of the slain.

26. There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; Their graves are around them; All of them slain, uncircumcised, by the sword, Though they caused terror in the land of the living.

27. Shall they not lie with the mighty of the uncircumcised that are fallen, Who have gone down to the pit with their weapons of war, Having their swords laid under their heads, And their iniquity resting upon their bones, Though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living?

28. And thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, And shalt lie down with them that are slain by the sword.

29. There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, Who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword; They lie down with the uncircumcised, With them that have gone down to the pit.

30. There are the princes of the North, All of them, and all the Sidonians, Who have gone down to the slain; In the midst of the terror of their might they are put to shame; They lie down uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, And bear their shame with them that have gone down to the pit.

31. Pharaoh shall see them, And shall comfort himself over all his multitude; Even Pharaoh and all his army are slain by the sword, Saith the Lord Jehovah.

32. Though I suffered him to spread terror in the land of the living, Yet is he laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, With them that are slain by the sword, Even Pharaoh and all his multitude, Saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 33

1. Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man out of their whole number, and set him for their watchman,

3. and he seeth the sword coming on the land, and bloweth the trumpet, and warneth the people,

4. then whoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, and the sword cometh and taketh him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.

5. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning. His blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall save his life.

6. But if the watchman see the sword coming, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come and take away any person from among them, he is taken away for his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.

7. So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the house of Israel, that thou shouldst hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me.

8. When I say to the wicked, "O wicked man, thou shalt surely die!" and thou speakest not to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die for his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.

9. Yet if thou warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it, and he turneth not from his way, he shall die for his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thyself.

10. Thou, therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Rightly do ye say, "Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and through them we pine away. How then can we live?"

11. Say to them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways! for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

12. Thou also, son of man, say to the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and through his wickedness shall not the wicked man fall in the day when he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live in the day when he sinneth.

13. When I say concerning the righteous, "He shall surely live," and he trusteth in his righteousness, and doeth iniquity, all his righteousness shall not be remembered, but for his iniquity which he hath committed shall he die.

14. Again, when I say concerning the wicked, "He shall surely die," and he turneth from his sin, and doeth that which is just and right,

15. and the wicked restoreth the pledge, giveth back that which he hath taken by violence, and walketh in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

16. None of his sins which he hath committed shall be mentioned to him; he hath done that which is just and right; he shall surely live.

17. And yet the sons of thy people say, "The way of the Lord is not right!" But it is their way which is not right.

18. When the righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he dieth because of it.

19. And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is just and right, he shall live thereby.

20. And yet ye say, "The way of the Lord is not right!" O house of Israel, I will judge you every one according to his ways!

21. And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, "The city is smitten!"

22. Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening before he that had escaped came; and he opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; he opened my mouth, so that I was no longer dumb.

23. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

24. Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes in the land of Israel say, "Abraham was but one, and he inherited the land; but we are many; to us is the land given for an inheritance."

25. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and life up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; and shall ye possess the land?

26. Ye trust to your swords, ye commit abomination, and ye defile, every one, his neighbor’s wife; and shall ye possess the land?

27. Say thou thus to them: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open country will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that are in the forts and caves shall fall by the pestilence.

28. And I will make the land an utter desolation; and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.

29. Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land an utter desolation, on account of all the abominations which they practise.

30. As for thee, O son of man, the sons of thy people speak concerning thee by the walls, and in the doors of houses; and speak one to another, every man to his neighbor, saying, "Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that goeth forth from Jehovah."

31. And they come to thee, as the people assembleth, and they sit before thee, as my people, and they hear thy words: but will not do them; for with their mouth they do what is lovely, but their heart goeth after gain.

32. And behold, thou art to them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but do them not.

33. But when this cometh to pass, (and behold, it shall come to pass,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.

## Ezekiel 34

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

3. Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill that which is fatted; but ye feed not the flock.

4. The weak do ye not strengthen, and the sick do ye not heal, and the wounded do ye not bind up; ye bring not back that which hath been driven away, neither seek ye that which hath been lost; but with force and with cruelty do ye rule them.

5. Therefore are they scattered abroad, because there is no shepherd, and they are food to all the beasts of the field, or are scattered abroad.

6. My sheep wander through all the mountains, and upon every high hill; yea, over the whole face of the land is my flock scattered, and none careth for them, or seeketh them.

7. Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:

8. As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, because my flock is become a prey, and my flock is become meat to all the beasts of the field because there is no shepherd, and because my shepherds search not for my flock, and feed themselves, and feed not my flock,—

9. therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah.

10. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, and they shall not be meat for them.

11. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, will seek my flock, and look after them;

12. as a shepherd looketh after his flock in the day when he is among his sheep that are scattered, so will I look after my sheep, and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the day of clouds and darkness.

13. And I will bring them out from the nations, and gather them from the countries; and I will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel, in the valleys, and in all the dwelling-places of the land.

14. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be; there shall they lie down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.

15. I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.

16. I will seek that which was lost, and bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong will I destroy; I will feed them as they deserve.

17. And as for you, O my sheep, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will judge between the weak of the flock and the strong ones, even the rams and the he-goats.

18. Seemeth it a small thing to you to eat up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to drink of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?

19. and that my sheep eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and drink that which ye have fouled with your feet?

20. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold I, even I, will judge between the fat and the lean of the flock.

21. Because ye thrust with your side and with your shoulder, and push all the weak with your horns, till ye scatter them abroad,

22. therefore will I save my sheep, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.

23. And I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

24. And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.

25. And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, so that they shall dwell safely in the desert, and sleep in the woods.

26. And I will make them, and the places round about my hill, a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; showers rich in blessings shall there be.

27. And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase; and they shall be secure in their land, and shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall break the bands of their yoke and deliver them out of the hand of them that made them servants.

28. And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell in security, and none shall make them afraid.

29. And I will raise up for them a plantation for my glory; and they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, neither shall they bear the reproach of the nations any more.

30. Then shall they know, that I, Jehovah, their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.

31. For ye, my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 35

1. Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, set thy face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

3. and say to it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee an utter desolation;

4. I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.

5. Because thou bearest a perpetual hatred, and deliverest up the sons of Israel to the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time when iniquity bringeth destruction:

6. therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, to blood will I bring thee, and blood shall pursue thee; since thou hast not hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.

7. Thus will I make Mount Seir an utter desolation, and cut off from it him that passeth out, and him that returneth.

8. And I will fill his valleys with the slain. Upon thy hills and in thy plains and in thy valleys shall fall they that are slain with the sword.

9. I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

10. Because thou hast said, "These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we shall possess them," whereas Jehovah was there;

11. therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which in thy hatred against them thou hast practised, and I will make myself known to them when I judge thee.

12. And thou shalt know that I am Jehovah, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying: "They are laid desolate; to us are they given to be devoured."

13. Thus with your mouth have ye magnified yourselves against me, and multiplied your words against me; I have heard them.

14. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole land rejoiceth, I will prepare desolation for thee.

15. As thou didst rejoice over my inheritance, the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to thee! Mount Seir shall be desolate, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 36

1. Also, thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.

2. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said concerning you, "Aha! the everlasting heights have become our possession";

3. therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, yea, because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, so that ye have become a possession to the residue of the nations, and a subject for the lips of talkers, and a derision to the people;

4. therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, to the mountains and the hills, the valleys and the plain, to the desolate wastes and to the forsaken cities, which are become a prey and a derision to the residue of the nations which are round about,—

5. therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, who have allotted my land to themselves for a possession, with joy of their whole heart, and with a despiteful mind, to cast it out for a prey.

6. Prophesy, therefore, concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the valleys and the plains, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the reproach of the nations.

7. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up my hand, that the nations that are round about you, that they shall bear their reproach.

8. But ye, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches, and bear your fruit for my people Israel; for they are near coming.

9. For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;

10. and I will multiply men upon you, even all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be built.

11. I will multiply men upon you, and beasts; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as of old, and will do better to you than in the ancient time; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

12. Yea, I will cause men, even my people Israel, to walk upon you, and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.

13. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say of you, "Thou hast devoured men, and made thy people childless!"

14. therefore thou shalt devour men no more, and no more make thy people childless, saith the Lord Jehovah.

15. Neither will I cause the reproach of the nations to be heard against thee any more, neither shalt thou bear the derision of the nations any more, neither shalt thou make thy nation childless any more, saith the lord Jehovah.

16. Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

17. Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings; their way before me was as the impurity of an unclean woman.

18. Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood which they had shed in the land, and because they had polluted it with their idols.

19. And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.

20. And when they came to the nations whither they went, they polluted my holy name, in that it was said of them, "These are the people of Jehovah, and they are gone forth out of his land."

21. Therefore I will have regard to my holy name, which the house of Israel have polluted among the nations whither they are gone.

22. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Not for your own sakes do I this, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have polluted among the nations whither ye are gone.

23. And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been polluted among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in regard to you, before their eyes, saith the Lord Jehovah.

24. For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land.

25. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. From all your uncleanness and from all your idols will I cleanse you.

26. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take out of your body the heart of stone, and I will give you a heart of flesh.

27. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my commandments and do them.

28. And ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

29. And I will save you from all your uncleanness. And I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and bring no famine upon you.

30. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.

31. Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings which were not good, and ye shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities, and for your abominations.

32. Not for your own sakes do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known to you. Be ye ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!

33. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, then will I cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places to be rebuilt;

34. and the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.

35. Then shall it be said, "This land, that was desolate, is become as the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited."

36. Then the nations that are left around you shall know that I, Jehovah, have built that which was ruined, and planted that which was desolate. I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.

37. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Yet will I listen to the house of Israel, and do this for them. I will increase

38. them with men like a flock; as the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 37

1. The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he carried me out in the spirit of Jehovah, and set me in the midst of a valley, which was full of bones,

2. and caused me to pass by them round about; and behold, there were very many upon the surface of the valley, and lo, they were very dry.

3. And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest!

4. Then he said to me, Prophesy to these dry bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah!

5. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live;

6. and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.

7. So I prophesied, as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, a voice was heard, and behold, a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.

8. And when I looked, behold, there were sinews upon them, and the flesh grew, and the skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.

9. Then said he to me, Prophesy to breath, prophesy, O son of man, and say to breath, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live!

10. So I prophesied, as he commanded me; and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great host.

11. And he said to me, Son of man, these bones denote the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, "Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off."

12. Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and bring you into the land of Israel.

13. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people,

14. and put my breath within you, and ye live, and I place you in your own land; then shall ye know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and done it, saith Jehovah.

15. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

16. Son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, "For Judah, and for the sons of Israel, his companions"; and take another stick, and write upon it, "For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and the whole house of Israel, his companions."

17. Then join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.

18. And when the sons of thy people say to thee. "Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?"

19. say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and of the tribes of Israel, his companions, and will unite them and him with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.

20. And let the sticks whereon thou writest be in thy hand before their eyes;

21. and say thou to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations whither they are gone, and will gather them from every side, and bring them into their own land.

22. And I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; and they shall no more be two nations, and no more shall they be divided into two kingdoms.

23. Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them from all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

24. And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd; and they shall walk in my commandments, and observe my statutes, and do them.

25. And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt; they shall dwell therein, and their sons and their son’s sons forever; and David, my servant, shall be their prince forever.

26. And I will make with them a covenant of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them [in the land], and multiply them, and set my sanctuary in the midst of them forever.

27. And my dwelling-place shall be with them; yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people;

28. and the nations shall know that I, Jehovah, do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.

## Ezekiel 38

1. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying:

2. Son of man, set thy face against Gog, of the land of Magog, prince of Resh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

3. and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Resh, Meshech, and Tubal!

4. And I will turn thee about, and put rings into thy jaws; and I will bring thee forth, thee and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in gorgeous apparel, even a great multitude with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords.

5. Persians, Ethiopians, and Lybians are with them, all of them with shields and helmets.

6. Gomer and all his bands, the house of Togarmah from the north quarters, and all their hosts, many nations are with thee.

7. Be prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou and all thy host that are assembled unto thee, and be thou their leader!

8. After many days shalt thou be appointed over them. In the latter years shalt thou come into a land that is brought back from the sword, gathered out of many nations upon the mountains of Israel, which had been long desolate; but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.

9. Thou shalt go up like a storm, thou shalt come like a cloud, to cover the land, thou and all thy bands, and many nations with thee.

10. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the same time shall thoughts come into thy mind, and thou shalt meditate an evil design,

11. and shalt say, "I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,

12. to take a spoil and to divide a prey, to turn my hand against the desolated places that have become inhabited, and against a people gathered out of the nations, possessing cattle and goods, dwelling in the heights of the earth."

13. Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, and all the chiefs thereof, shall say to thee, "Art thou come to take a spoil? Hast thou gathered thy company to divide a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, and to divide great spoil?"

14. Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, thou shalt observe it,

15. and thou shalt come up from the regions of the North, thou and many nations with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty host;

16. thou shalt come up against my people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land; in the latter days it shall come to pass, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in regard to thee, before their eyes, O Gog!

17. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou not he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days and years, that I would bring thee against them?

18. And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my anger shall ascend in fury.

19. For in my jealousy, in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel,

20. so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field; and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence; and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.

21. And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall all turn their swords against each other,

22. And I will contend against him with pestilence, and with blood; and overflowing showers, and great hailstones, fire and brimstone, will I rain upon him and his hosts, and the many nations that are with him.

23. Thus will I show myself in my greatness and glory, and make myself known before the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 39

1. And do thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Resh, Meshech, and Tubal!

2. I will turn thee, and lead thee about, and cause thee to come up from the regions of the North. and bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.

3. And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

4. Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou and all thy hosts, and the nations that are with thee. To the ravenous birds of every wing, and to the beasts of the forest, give I thee to be devoured.

5. Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

6. And I will send a fire upon Magog, and upon them that dwell in security in the sea-coasts; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

7. So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not suffer my holy name to be polluted any more; and the nations shall

8. know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel. Behold it cometh, and shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah. This is the day of which I spake.

9. Then shall the inhabitants of the cities of Israel go forth, and set on fire and burn the weapons, the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, the hand-staves and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years.

10. They shall take no wood from the field, neither shall they cut down any from the forests; for they shall make their fires of the weapons. And they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and plunder those that plundered them, saith the Lord Jehovah.

11. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place there, a grave in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea; and it shall stop the way of passengers. There shall they bury Gog and all his multitude, and they shall call it "The valley of the multitude of Gog."

12. And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.

13. Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be renown to them, in the day when I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.

14. And they shall set apart men to be constantly employed, who, passing through the land, with the aid of those that pass by, shall bury those that remain upon the face of the land to cleanse it; at the end of the seven months shall they search.

15. And when any of the travellers that pass through the land shall see a man’s bone, they shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.

16. Also the name of a city shall be Multitude. Thus shall they cleanse the land.

17. And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Say to the birds of every wing, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves and come, gather yourselves from every side to my sacrifice which I make for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; and ye shall eat flesh and drink blood;

18. the flesh of the mighty shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatted in Bashan.

19. And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I make for you.

20. Thus shall ye be filled at my table with horses and riders, and mighty men and warriors of all kinds, saith the Lord Jehovah.

21. And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have executed, and my hand which I have laid upon them.

22. And the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah, their God, from that day and forward.

23. And the nations shall know that the house of Israel were carried into captivity for their iniquity. Because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword.

24. According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I dealt with them, and hid my face from them.

25. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring back the captives of Jacob, and have compassion upon the whole house of Israel, and be jealous for my holy name.

26. Then shall they forget their shame and all their trespasses with which they trespassed against me, when they dwell in security in their own land, and none maketh them afraid.

27. When I bring them back from the nations, and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then will I be glorified in regard to them before the eyes of many nations.

28. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to be carried into captivity among the nations, and gathered them into their own land, and left none of them there.

29. And I will hide my face from them no more; for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 40

1. In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the first month, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, on the selfsame day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me [thither into the city].

2. In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, upon which was, as it were, the frame of a city toward the south.

3. And when he had brought me thither, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was as the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring-reed, and he stood in the gate.

4. And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears, and give heed to all which I shall show thee; for to the intent that I might show them to thee art thou brought hither; declare all which thou seest to the house of Israel!

5. And behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed, in length six cubits of a cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the breadth of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.

6. Then came he to the gate, which looked toward the east, and went up the steps thereof, and measured the upper threshold of the gate, one reed broad, and the other threshold of the gate one reed broad.

7. And every chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.

8. He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

9. Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the border thereof, two cubits; now the porch of the gate was inward.

10. And the chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure, and the projecting wall-pillars were of one measure on this side, and on that side.

11. And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the entry of the gate, thirteen cubits.

12. There was also a space before the chambers one cubit on this side, and a space one cubit on that side; and every chamber was six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

13. Then he measured the gate from the roof of one chamber to the roof of another; the breadth was five and twenty cubits, and door was over against door.

14. He made also wall-pillars sixty cubits, and toward the pillars, was the court of the gate round about on every side.

15. And from the front of the gate of the entrance to the front of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

16. And there were closed windows to the chambers and to their wall-pillars inward toward the gate round about, and likewise to the cornices; there were windows round about within, and upon the wall-pillars were palm-trees.

17. Then he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there were rooms, and a pavement made for the court round about; thirty rooms were upon the pavement.

18. And the pavement at the sides of the gates, by the length of the gates, was the lower pavement.

19. Then he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits toward the east and toward the north.

20. And as for the gate that looked toward the north in the outer court, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.

21. And the chambers thereof were three on this side, and three on that side. And the border thereof, and the cornices thereof, were of the same measure as the former gate; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

22. And the windows thereof, and the cornices thereof, and the palm-trees thereof were of the same measure as the gate which looked toward the east, and they went up to it by seven steps, and the cornices thereof were before them.

23. And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north and east. And he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.

24. Then he led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured the border thereof and the cornices thereof according to those measures.

25. And there were windows in it, and within the cornices thereof round about, like those windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

26. And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the cornices thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side and another on that side, upon the wall-pillars thereof.

27. And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.

28. And he brought me to the inner court through the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to the same measures.

29. And the chambers thereof, and the border thereof, and the cornices thereof were according to those measures. And there were windows in it, and within the cornices thereof, round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

30. And the cornices round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.

31. And the cornices thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the wall-pillars thereof; and in going up to it there were eight steps.

32. And he brought me to the inner court toward the east; and he measured the gate according to those measures.

33. And the chambers thereof, and the border thereof, and the cornices thereof, were according to those measures; and there were windows in it, and in the cornices thereof, round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

34. And the cornices thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the wall-pillars thereof, on this side and on that side; and in going up to it there were eight steps.

35. And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to those measures;

36. the chambers thereof, and the border thereof, and the cornices thereof; and there were windows to it, round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

37. And the cornices thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the wall-pillars thereof, on this side and on that side; and in going up to it there were eight steps.

38. And a room with its doors was by the borders of the gates, where they washed the burnt-offering.

39. And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering.

40. And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables;

41. four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side; on the other side of the gate eight tables, whereon they slew their sacrifices.

42. And the four tables for the burnt-offering were of hewn stone; their length was a cubit and a half, and their breadth a cubit and a half, and their height a cubit. Thereon they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.

43. And there were edging-boards of a handbreadth, prepared within round about; and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.

44. And without the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court; they were at the side of the north gate, and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.

45. And he said to me, This room, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests that keep the charge of the house.

46. And the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests that keep the charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who, among the sons of Levi, come near to Jehovah to minister to him.

47. Then he measured the court; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth a hundred cubits, being square. And the altar stood before the house.

48. Then he brought me to the porch of the temple, and he measured the door-border of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. And the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.

49. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and they went up to it by steps. And there were columns by the door-border, one on this side, and another on that side.

## Ezekiel 41

1. Afterwards he brought me to the temple; and he measured the projecting wall-pillars, six cubits broad on this side, and six cubits broad on that side, according to the breadth of the house.

2. And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on this side; and five cubits on that side. Then he measured the length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.

3. And he went inward, and measured the border of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.

4. Then he measured twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth in the temple, and said to me, This is the most holy place.

5. And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits round about, round about the house:

6. And the side-chambers were chamber to chamber, three and thirty times; and they entered into the wall of the house of the side-chambers round about, and were connected with it; but they were not connected with the wall of the house.

7. And, the side-chambers became wider upward, having a winding ascent. For the circuit of the house went still upward, round about the house; therefore the greater breadth of the house was upward; and so they ascended from the lowest story to the highest through the middle story.

8. I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed, six cubits to the knuckles.

9. The thickness of the wall of the side-chambers outward was five cubits, and the space which was left was the place of the side-chambers of the house.

10. And between the rooms was the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.

11. And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the space that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the space that was left was five cubits round about.

12. And the building which was before the separate place, at the side toward the west, was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof was ninety cubits.

13. Then he measured the length of the house, a hundred cubits; and the length of the separate place and the building and the walls thereof, a hundred cubits.

14. Also the breadth towards the front of the house and of the separate place toward the east was a hundred cubits.

15. And he measured the length of the building before the separate place, and that which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on this side and on that side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court,

16. the thresholds, and the windows that were closed, and the galleries round about the three sides. Over against the threshold was a table of wood round about, from the ground to the windows, and the windows were covered with it;

17. upon the space above every door, and upon the inner house, and without, and upon all the wall round about within and without, according to measure.

18. And cherubs and palm-trees were made, one palm-tree between two cherubs, and every cherub had two faces;

19. and the face of a man was toward a palm-tree on one side, and the face of a lion toward a palm-tree on the other side. So was it made upon all the house round about.

20. From the ground to above the door were cherubs and palm-trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

21. The posts of the temple were four-square; and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance.

22. The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and two cubits long; and the corners thereof and the base thereof and the walls thereof were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that standeth before Jehovah.

23. And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

24. And the two doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for one door, and two leaves for the other door.

25. And there were made on them, even on the doors of the temple, cherubs and palm-trees, such as were made upon the walls, and a wooden threshold was before the porch without.

26. And at the closed windows were palm-trees on this side, and on that side, on the sides of the porch, and on the side-chambers of the house, and on the thresholds.

## Ezekiel 42

1. Then he led me forth to the outer court, in the direction toward the north, and he brought me to the rooms which were before the separate place, and before the building toward the north.

2. The length was a hundred cubits before the gate toward the north, and the breadth was fifty cubits;

3. over against the twenty cubits in the inner court, and over against the pavement in the outer court, was gallery before gallery, in three rows.

4. And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.

5. And the upper rooms were narrower (for the galleries took away room from them) than the lower and middle chambers of the building.

6. For they were in three stories; but had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts; therefore they were narrower than the lowest, and than the middlemost from the ground.

7. And as to the wall that was without, over against the chambers, toward the outer court, before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.

8. For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits; but before the temple it was a hundred cubits.

9. And under these rooms was an entry from the east, as one came to them from the outer court.

10. In the breadth of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place and before the building, were rooms.

11. And there was a way before them similar to that before the rooms toward the north. Both their length and their breadth were the same, and all their goings out and their fashions and their doors were the same.

12. And so also were the doors of the rooms toward the south; there was a door at the head of the way, before the well-built wall in the way toward the east, as one entered into them.

13. Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, are holy rooms, where the priests, when they come near to Jehovah, eat the most holy things. There shall they lay the most holy things, both the flour-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.

14. When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but shall leave there the garments in which they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and approach to the place which belongeth to the people.

15. Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth to the gate, whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.

16. He measured the east side with the measuring-reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed round about.

17. He measured the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed round about.

18. He measured the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.

19. He turned himself also to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.

20. On all the four sides measured he the wall round about five hundred reeds in length, and five hundred in breadth, to make a separation between the holy and the unholy place.

## Ezekiel 43

1. Then he brought me to the gate, even to the gate that looketh toward the east.

2. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the east; and the sound thereof was as the sound of great waters, and the earth shone with his glory.

3. And the appearance was like the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city; it was a vision like the vision which I saw at the river Chebar. And I fell upon my face.

4. And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by way of the gate, whose prospect was toward the east.

5. Then the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.

6. And I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and a man was standing by me.

7. And he said to me: Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever; and the house of Israel shall no more pollute my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their fornication, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their sepulchres;

8. in that they set their threshold by my threshold, and their post near my post, so that there was only a wall between me and them, and defiled my holy name by the abominations which they committed; wherefore I have consumed them in my anger.

9. Now let them remove far away from me their fornication, and the carcasses of their kings; and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.

10. And thou, son of man, show this house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and that they may measure the pattern.

11. And if they be ashamed of all which they have done, let them know the form of the house and the fashion thereof, and the passages for going out and coming in, and all the forms thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and all the laws thereof, and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and do them.

12. This is the law of the house. Upon the top of the mountain, all within its limits shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.

13. And these are the measures of the altar by cubits; each cubit being a cubit and a hand-breadth. The bottom shall be a cubit high and a cubit broad; and the border thereof, by the edge thereof round about, shall be a span; and this shall be the outer part of the altar.

14. And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.

15. And the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar upward shall be four horns.

16. And the altar shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad; square on the four sides thereof.

17. And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad on the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and its steps shall look toward the east.

18. And he said to me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the statutes of the altar, in the day when it is made, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.

19. To the priests, the sons of Levi, of the race of Zadok, that come near to me, saith the Lord Jehovah, to minister to me, thou shalt give a young bullock for a sin-offering.

20. And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border round about, and thus cleanse and purge it.

21. And thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.

22. And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bullock.

23. And when thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

24. And thou shalt offer them before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and offer them up for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.

25. Seven days shalt thou sacrifice daily a goat for a sin-offering; they shall also sacrifice a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

26. Seven days shall they purge the altar, and purify it, and consecrate themselves.

27. And when they have finished these days, it shall be that on the eighth day and forward the priests shall present your burnt-offerings and your thank-offerings upon the altar, and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 44

1. Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

2. Then said Jehovah to me: This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because Jehovah, the God of Israel, entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.

3. The prince, because he is prince, shall sit in it, to eat food before Jehovah; he shall enter through the porch of that gate, and by the same way shall he go out.

4. Then he brought me to the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah. And I fell upon my face.

5. And Jehovah said to me: Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well all the entrances of the house, and all the outward passages of the sanctuary.

6. And say to the rebellious house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you of all your abominations, O house of Israel,

7. in that ye brought strangers, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, so that ye polluted my house when ye offered my food, the fat and the blood, and broke my covenant by all your abominations.

8. And ye kept not the charge of my holy place, but appointed for yourselves such keepers of my charge in my sanctuary.

9. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: No stranger, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of all the strangers that are among the sons of Israel.

10. But even the Levites, who departed from me when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, shall bear their iniquity.

11. Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering at the house; they shall slay the burnt-offering and sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.

12. Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, that they shall bear their iniquity.

13. And they shall not come near to me to do the office of a priest to me, and to come near to any of my holy things in the most holy place, but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.

14. But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all which is to be done therein.

15. But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah.

16. They shall come into my sanctuary, and they shall draw near to my table to minister to me, and shall keep my charge.

17. And when they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, and no wool shall come upon them while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within the house.

18. They shall have linen coverings upon their heads, and linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat.

19. And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they ministered, and lay them in the holy rooms, and shall clothe themselves with other garments, that they may not sanctify the people with their garments.

20. They shall neither shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall shear their heads.

21. And no priest shall drink wine when they enter into the inner court.

22. Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, or her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the race of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.

23. And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and unholy, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

24. And in controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my statutes shall they judge. And they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my festivals, and they shall hallow my sabbaths.

25. And they shall come to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.

26. And after his cleansing they shall reckon to him seven days.

27. And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.

28. And it shall be to them for an inheritance, that I am their inheritance. And ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.

29. They shall eat the flour-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.

30. And the first of all the first-fruits, and every oblation of all your oblations, shall belong to the priests. Ye shall also give to the priest the first of your meal, that he may cause a blessing to rest on thine house.

31. The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or that is torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

## Ezekiel 45

1. Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth ten thousand. This shall be holy in all its borders round about.

2. And of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length and five hundred in breadth square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.

3. And of this measure shalt thou measure in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth ten thousand; and in it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place.

4. This is the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.

5. Five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves for a possession, and twenty rooms.

6. And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and five and twenty thousand in length, over against the oblation of the holy portion; it shall be for all the house of Israel.

7. And a portion shall be for the prince on this side and on that side of the oblation of the holy portion and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward; and the length shall be over against every one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.

8. As for the land, it shall be to him a possession in Israel, that my princes may no more oppress my people, but give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.

9. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel! Remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, and cease from your expulsions of my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.

10. Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

11. The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure; that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer; the measure thereof shall be according to the homer.

12. And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be to you one maneh.

13. This is the heave-offering which ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of barley.

14. And as for the statute concerning oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of a cor; a cor being ten baths; for a homer is ten baths.

15. And ye shall offer one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, from the watered pastures of Israel, for the flour-offering and for the burnt-offering, and for the thank-offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.

16. All the people of the land shall give this heave-offering for the prince in Israel.

17. And it shall be the duty of the prince to give burnt-offerings, and flour-offerings, and drink-offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, and in all the solemn assemblies of the house of Israel; he shall present the sin-offering, and the flour-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

18. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, on the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and shalt cleanse the sanctuary.

19. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.

20. And so shalt thou do on the seventh day for him that hath transgressed through error or simplicity; so shall ye make reconciliation for the house.

21. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; every one shall eat unleavened bread.

22. And upon that day shall the prince sacrifice for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.

23. And the seven days of the feast he shall sacrifice a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.

24. And he shall present a flour-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah.

25. In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like, in the feast, seven days, according to the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the flour-offering, and the oil.

## Ezekiel 46

1. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court, that looketh toward the east, shall be shut the six working-days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.

2. And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the outer gate, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall present his burnt-offerings, and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate; then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.

3. Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.

4. And the burnt-offering, which the prince shall offer to Jehovah on the sabbath-day, shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.

5. And the flour-offering shall be an ephah for a ram; and the flour-offering for the lambs as much as he is disposed to give; and a hin of oil to an ephah.

6. And in the day of the new moon there shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs and a ram; they shall be without blemish.

7. And he shall present, as a flour-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as much as he is able to give; and a hin of oil to an ephah.

8. And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.

9. But when the people of the land come before Jehovah in the solemn feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he entered, but shall go forth over against it.

10. And the prince shall go in in the midst of them when they go in, and when they go forth shall he go forth.

11. And in the feasts and in the solemn assemblies the flour-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs what he is disposed to give; and a hin of oil to an ephah.

12. And when the prince shall present a free-will burnt-offering or a free-will thank-offering to Jehovah, the gate that looketh toward the east shall be opened for him, and he shall present his burnt-offering, or his thank-offering, as he was wont to do on the sabbath-day; then he shall go forth, and the gate shall be shut after he hath gone forth.

13. And thou shalt present for a burnt-offering daily to Jehovah a lamb that is a year old without blemish; every morning shalt thou present it.

14. And thou shalt present with it every morning a flour-offering, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, for a flour-offering to Jehovah, by a perpetual statute continually.

15. Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the flour-offering, and the oil, every morning, for a continual burnt-offering.

16. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall belong to his sons; it shall be their possession by inheritance.

17. But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty, when it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance given to his sons shall be theirs.

18. And the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give an inheritance to his sons out of his own possession; that no one of my people may be driven from his possession.

19. Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, which looked toward the north; and behold, there was a place behind toward the west.

20. And he said to me: This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering, and the sin-offering, and bake the flour-offering; that they may not bear them into the outer court, and so sanctify the people.

21. Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, there was a court in every corner of the court.

22. In the four corners of the court were covered courts forty cubits long, and thirty broad; these four corners were of one measure.

23. And there was in them a wall round about, even round about the four; and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.

24. Then said he to me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

## Ezekiel 47

1. Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued forth from under the threshold of the house eastward; for the fore-front of the house stood toward the east. And the waters flowed down from the side of the house, south of the altar.

2. Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward; and he brought me round by the way without to the outer gate, that looked toward the east; and behold, there ran out waters from the right side.

3. And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the waters, and the waters were to the soles of the feet.

4. Again he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through the waters, and the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through, and the waters were to the loins.

5. Again he measured a thousand cubits, and it was a river, which I could not pass through; for the waters were high, waters to swim in, a river which could not be passed through.

6. And he said to me, Hast thou seen this, son of man? Then he brought me back to the brink of the river.

7. Now when I had returned, behold, at the brink of the river were very many trees, on the one side and on the other.

8. Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward the east region, and run down into the desert, and go into the sea; they go forth into the sea, and the waters shall be healed.

9. And it shall come to pass, that every living thing that moveth, whithersoever the river shall come, shall live, and there shall be very many fish there; for when these waters shall come thither, [the waters of the sea] shall be healed, and everything shall live whither the river cometh.

10. And it shall come to pass that fishers shall stand upon it; from En-gedi to En-eglaim shall be places to spread nets; and therein shall be fish according to their kinds, like the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.

11. But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be appointed for salt.

12. And by the river, upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, and whose fruit shall not fail; every month shall they bring forth new fruit; because their waters issue forth from the sanctuary. And their fruit shall be for food, and their leaves for medicine.

13. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is the border, according to which ye shall distribute the land among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.

14. And ye shall inherit it, one like another. For I have lifted up my hand, that I would give it to your fathers; and this land shall fall to you for an inheritance.

15. And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side: from the great sea toward the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad,

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath, and Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.

17. And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-Enon, the border of Damascus and farther northward, and the border of Hamath.

18. This is the north side. And the east side ye shall measure between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel by the Jordan, from the border to the east sea. This is the east side.

19. And the south side southward shall be from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, as far as the river by the great sea.

20. This is the south side southward. And the west side shall be the great sea, from the border till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.

21. So shall ye divide this land among you, according to the tribes of Israel.

22. And ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who have begotten children among you; and they shall be to you as born in the country among the sons of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

23. And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth there shall ye appoint him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 48

1. And these are the names of the tribes. From the north end by the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazar-Enan, the border of Damascus northward toward Hamath; and to him belongeth from the east side to the west side: Dan, one tribe.

2. And by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side: Asher, one tribe.

3. And by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west side: Naphtali, one tribe.

4. And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side: Manasseh, one tribe.

5. And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side: Ephraim, one tribe.

6. And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west side: Reuben, one tribe.

7. And by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side: Judah, one tribe.

8. And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other portions from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

9. The oblation which ye shall offer to Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand reeds in length, and ten thousand in breadth.

10. And the holy oblation shall be for these: for the priests toward the north five and twenty thousand reeds in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length. And the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the midst thereof.

11. It shall belong to the priests, the sanctified ones, to the sons of Zadok, who kept my charge, who went not astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

12. And it shall belong to them as an oblation out of the oblation of the land, as most holy, by the border of the Levites.

13. And over against the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand reeds in length and ten thousand in breadth; the whole length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.

14. And they shall not sell of it; neither shall they exchange or transfer the first fruits of the land; for it is holy to Jehovah.

15. And the five thousand which are left in breadth, over against the five and twenty thousand in length, shall be common land for the city, for habitation and for suburbs. And the city shall be in the midst of it.

16. And this shall be the measure thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

17. And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.

18. And as to the residue in length, over against the holy portion, ten thousand eastward and ten thousand westward, over against the holy portion, its increase shall be for food to them that serve the city.

19. And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.

20. All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand reeds by five and twenty thousand; ye shall offer the holy oblation, four-square, together with the possession of the city.

21. And the residue on both sides of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand to the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand to the west border, by the portions of the tribes, shall be for the prince; and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.

22. What is left from the possession of the Levites and of the city, which are between what belongs to the prince, between the borders of Judah and Benjamin, shall belong to the prince.

23. And as for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side: Benjamin, one tribe.

24. And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side: Simeon, one tribe.

25. And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side: Issachar, one tribe.

26. And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side: Zebulon, one tribe.

27. And by the border of Zebulon, from the east side to the west side: Gad, one tribe.

28. And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, shall the border be from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, even to the river by the great sea.

29. This is the land which ye shall divide by lot of the possession among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, saith the Lord Jehovah.

30. And these are the gates of the city. On the north side shall the measure be four thousand five hundred reeds.

31. And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel; three gates northward,—one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

32. And on the east side shall be four thousand and five hundred [reeds]; and three gates,—one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.

33. And on the south side its measure shall be four thousand five hundred; and three gates,—one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulon.

34. On the west side, four thousand and five hundred; and three gates,—one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.

35. Its measure round about was eighteen thousand reeds. And the name of the city from that day shall be Jehovah-is-there.
