# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

2. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for Jehovah has spoken. I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.

3. The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib, but Israel does not know; my people does not consider.

4. Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Jehovah. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They have gone away backward.

5. Why will ye still be stricken, that ye revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

6. From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, but wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes. They have not been closed nor bound up nor soothed with oil.

7. Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Your land-strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

8. And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a shed in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

9. Unless Jehovah of hosts had left to us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.

10. Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

11. What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says Jehovah. I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts. And I do not delight in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he-goats.

12. When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand-to trample my courts?

13. Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies-I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn meeting.

14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They are a trouble to me. I am weary of bearing them.

15. And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.

16. Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.

17. Learn to do good. Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

18. Come now, and let us reason together, says Jehovah, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

19. If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.

20. But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.

21. How the faithful city has become a harlot! She who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.

22. Thy silver has become dross, thy wine mixed with water.

23. Thy rulers are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They judge not the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow come to them.

24. Therefore says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies.

25. And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin.

26. And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning. Afterward thou shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.

27. Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.

28. But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.

29. For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.

30. For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.

31. And the strong man shall be as flax, and his work as a spark. And they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.

## Isaiah 2

1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

2. And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Jehovah's house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow to it.

3. And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.

4. And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples, and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

5. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.

6. For thou have forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are filled with things from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines. And they strike hands with the children of foreigners.

7. And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures. Their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.

8. Their land is also full of idols. They worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made,

9. and so the common man bows down, and the great man degrades himself. Therefore do not forgive them.

10. Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.

11. The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.

12. For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low,

13. and upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

14. and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,

15. and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,

16. and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.

17. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.

18. And the idols shall utterly pass away.

19. And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.

20. In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats,

21. to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.

22. Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for how is he to be accounted of?

## Isaiah 3

1. For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and staff, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water,

2. the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder,

3. the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the expert craftsman, and the skilful enchanter.

4. And I will give sons to be their rulers, and babes shall rule over them.

5. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor. The child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.

6. When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, Thou have clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand,

7. in that day he shall lift up his voice, saying, I will not be a healer, for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. Ye shall not make me ruler of the people.

8. For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

9. The show of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have done evil to themselves.

10. Say ye of the righteous, that it is well, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

11. Woe to the wicked! It is ill with him, for what his hands have done shall be done to him.

12. As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, those who lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

13. Jehovah stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.

14. Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the rulers of it. It is ye who have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of a poor man is in your houses.

15. What do ye mean that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.

16. Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet,

17. therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.

18. In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the hair nets, and the crescents,

19. the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

20. the bonnets, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets,

21. the rings, and the nose-jewels,

22. the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels,

23. the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.

24. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness, and instead of a girdle, a rope, and instead of well set hair, baldness, and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth, branding instead of beauty.

25. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

26. And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.

## Isaiah 4

1. And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel. Only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.

2. In that day the branch of Jehovah shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for those who have escaped from Israel.

3. And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem,

4. when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.

5. And Jehovah will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for over all the glory, a covering.

6. And there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.

## Isaiah 5

1. Let me sing for my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.

2. And he dug it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress in it. And he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

3. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.

4. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?

5. And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the hedge of it, and it shall be eaten up. I will break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down.

6. And I will lay it waste. It shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

7. For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant. And he looked for justice, but behold, oppression, for righteousness, but behold, a cry.

8. Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field, till there is no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!

9. In my ears says Jehovah of hosts, of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

10. For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.

11. Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink, who tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!

12. And the harp and the lute, the tambourine and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts, but they do not regard the work of Jehovah, nor have they considered the operation of his hands.

13. Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of knowledge, and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.

14. Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure. And their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.

15. And the common man is bowed down, and the great man is debased, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled,

16. but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.

17. Then the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and wanderers shall eat the waste places of the fat ones.

18. Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope,

19. who say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it. And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!

20. Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil, who put darkness for light, and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

21. Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!

22. Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink,

23. who justify the wicked for rewards, and take away the justice of the righteous man from him!

24. Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust, because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

25. Therefore the anger of Jehovah is kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them. And the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

26. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will whistle for them from the end of the earth, and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.

27. None shall be weary nor stumble among them. None shall slumber nor sleep, nor shall the belt of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken,

28. whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent. Their horses' hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind.

29. Their roaring shall be like a lioness. They shall roar like young lions. Yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.

30. And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. And if a man looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress, and the light is darkened in the clouds of it.

## Isaiah 6

1. In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

2. Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings, with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.

3. And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory.

4. And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with vapor.

5. Then I said, Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.

6. Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.

7. And he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this has touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.

8. And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Lo, send me.

9. And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but do not understand, and see ye indeed, but do not perceive.

10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and be healed.

11. Then I said, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,

12. and Jehovah has removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.

13. And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up. As a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled, so the holy seed is the stock of it.

## Isaiah 7

1. And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

2. And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.

3. Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field.

4. And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet. Fear not, nor let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

5. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,

6. Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach in it for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel,

7. thus says the lord Jehovah: It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.

8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. And within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that is shall not be a people.

9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.

10. And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,

11. Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God, ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I test Jehovah.

13. And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David. Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?

14. Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

15. Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.

16. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhor shall be forsaken.

17. Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah-even the king of Assyria.

18. And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will whistle for the fly that is in the outermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

19. And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.

20. In that day the Lord will shave with a razor what is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet, and it shall also consume the beard.

21. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep.

22. And it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter. For everyone who is left in the midst of the land shall eat butter and honey.

23. And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver coins, shall be for briers and thorns.

24. Men shall come there with arrows and with bow, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.

25. And all the hills that were dug with the mattock, thou shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.

## Isaiah 8

1. And Jehovah said to me, Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it with the pen of a man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

2. And I will take to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

3. And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

4. For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.

5. And Jehovah spoke to me yet again, saying,

6. Inasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son,

7. now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks,

8. and it shall sweep onward into Judah. It shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

9. Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces. And give ear, all ye of far countries. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.

10. Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nothing. Speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us.

11. For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,

12. Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people shall say, A conspiracy, nor fear ye their fear, nor be in dread of it.

13. Jehovah of hosts, him ye shall sanctify, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.

14. And he shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a net and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

15. And many shall stumble on it, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

16. Bind thou up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples.

17. And I will wait for Jehovah, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will be a man who has trusted in him.

18. Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwells in mount Zion.

19. And when they shall say to you, Seek for those who have familiar spirits and for the wizards, who chirp and who mutter, should not a people seek for their God? On behalf of the living seek to the dead?

20. Seek to the law and to the testimony! If they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.

21. And they shall pass through it, greatly distressed and hungry. And it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward.

22. And they shall look to the earth, and, behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and into thick darkness to be driven away.

## Isaiah 9

1. But there shall be no gloom to her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.

2. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shone.

3. Thou have multiplied the nation. Thou have increased their joy. They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

4. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou have broken as in the day of Midian.

5. For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.

6. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given. And the government shall be upon his shoulder. And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace.

7. Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even forever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.

8. The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted upon Israel.

9. And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,

10. The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone, the sycamores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.

11. Therefore Jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,

12. the Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind, and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

13. Yet the people have not turned to him who smote them, nor have they sought Jehovah of hosts.

14. Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.

15. The elder and the honorable man, he is the head. And the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.

16. For those who lead this people cause them to err, and those who are led by them are destroyed.

17. Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows. For everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

18. For wickedness burns as the fire. It devours the briers and thorns. Yea, it kindles in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.

19. Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up, and the people are as the fuel of fire; no man spares his brother.

20. And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry. And he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied. They shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm-

21. Manasseh, Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh, and together they shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

## Isaiah 10

1. Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write perverseness,

2. to turn aside the needy from justice, and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!

3. And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? To whom will ye flee for help? And where will ye leave your glory?

4. They shall only bow down under the prisoners, and shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

5. Ho, Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!

6. I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath. I will give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

7. However he does not so reason, nor does his heart so think, but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.

8. For he says, Are not my rulers all of them kings?

9. Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?

10. As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and of Samaria,

11. shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?

12. Therefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord has performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

13. For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding. And I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. And like a valiant man I have brought down those who sit on thrones.

14. And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the peoples. And like a gathering of eggs that are forsaken, I have gathered all the earth. And there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.

15. Shall the axe boast itself against him who hews with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up him who is not wood.

16. Therefore will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his fat ones, leanness, and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.

17. And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.

18. And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. And it shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.

19. And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may write them.

20. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him who smote them, but shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

21. A remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

22. For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.

23. For a full end, and that determined, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will make in the midst of all the earth.

24. Therefore thus says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, though he smites thee with the rod, and lifts up his staff against thee, according to the manner of Egypt.

25. For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and my anger is to his destruction.

26. And Jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up according to the manner of Egypt.

27. And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of fatness.

28. He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he lays up his baggage.

29. They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled.

30. Cry aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim! Hearken, O Laishah! O thou poor Anathoth!

31. Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.

32. This very day he shall halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33. Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will lop off the boughs with terror. And the high of stature shall be hewn down, and the lofty shall be brought low.

34. And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

## Isaiah 11

1. And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse. And a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit.

2. And the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.

3. And his delight shall be in the fear of Jehovah. And he shall not judge according to the sight of his eyes, nor decide according to the hearing of his ears,

4. but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth. And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.

5. And righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.

6. And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.

7. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together. And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

8. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.

9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.

10. And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and he who arises to rule over the Gentiles. In him shall the Gentiles hope, and his resting-place shall be glorious.

11. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, who shall remain, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

12. And he will set up an ensign for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

13. Also the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and those who vex Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

14. And they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines on the west. Together they shall despoil the sons of the east. They shall put forth their hand upon Edom and Moab, and the sons of Ammon shall obey them.

15. And Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea. And with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will smite it into seven streams, and cause men to march over dry shod.

16. And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, who shall remain, from Assyria, like as there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

## Isaiah 12

1. And in that day thou shall say, I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, for though thou were angry with me. Thine anger is turned away and thou comfort me.

2. Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid, for Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation.

3. Therefore with joy ye shall draw water out of the wells of salvation.

4. And in that day ye shall say, Give thanks to Jehovah. Call upon his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Make mention that his name is exalted.

5. Sing to Jehovah, for he has done excellent things. Let this be known in all the earth.

6. Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great in the midst of thee is the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 13

1. The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.

2. Set ye up an ensign upon the bare mountain. Lift up the voice to them. Wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

3. I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.

4. The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people! The noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Jehovah of hosts is mustering the army for the battle.

5. They come from a far country, from the outermost part of heaven, even Jehovah, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

6. Wail ye, for the day of Jehovah is at hand. It shall come as destruction from the Almighty.

7. Therefore all hands shall be feeble, and every heart of man shall melt.

8. And they shall be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold. They shall be in pain as a woman in travail. They shall look in amazement one at another, their faces, faces of flame.

9. Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the land a desolation, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.

10. For the stars of heaven and the constellations of it shall not give their light. The sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not cause its light to shine.

11. And I will punish the world for the evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. And I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

12. I will make a man more rare than fine gold, even a man than the pure gold of Ophir.

13. Therefore I will make the heavens to tremble, and the earth shall be shaken out of its place, in the wrath of Jehovah of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

14. And it shall come to pass, that as the chased roe, and as sheep that no man gathers, they shall turn every man to his own people, and shall flee every man to his own land.

15. Everyone who is found shall be thrust through, and everyone who is taken shall fall by the sword.

16. Their infants also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses shall be rifled, and their wives ravished.

17. Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not regard silver, and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

18. And their bows shall dash the young men in pieces. And they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.

19. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

20. It shall never be inhabited, nor shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there, nor shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.

21. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there, and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures. And ostriches shall dwell there, and wild goats shall dance there.

22. And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. And her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

## Isaiah 14

1. For Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land. And the sojourner shall join himself with them, and they shall cling to the house of Jacob.

2. And the peoples shall take them, and bring them to their place. And the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of Jehovah for servants and for handmaids. And they shall take them captive whose captives they were, and they shall rule over their oppressors.

3. And it shall come to pass in the day that Jehovah shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble, and from the hard service in which thou were made to serve,

4. that thou shall take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!

5. Jehovah has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers,

6. who smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.

7. The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet. They break forth into singing.

8. Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou are laid low, no hewer has come up against us.

9. Sheol from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming. It stirs up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

10. They shall all answer and say to thee, Have thou also become weak as we? Have thou become like us?

11. Thy pomp is brought down to Sheol, and the noise of thy viols. The worm is spread under thee, and worms cover thee.

12. How thou are fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How thou are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low!

13. And thou said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the outermost parts of the north.

14. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will make myself like the Most High.

15. Yet thou shall be brought down to Sheol, to the utmost parts of the pit.

16. Those who see thee shall gaze at thee. They shall consider thee, saying, Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms,

17. who made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities of it, who did not let loose his prisoners to their home?

18. All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, each one in his own house.

19. But thou are cast forth away from thy sepulcher like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit, as a dead body trodden under foot.

20. Thou shall not be joined with them in burial, because thou have destroyed thy land. Thou have slain thy people. The seed of evildoers shall not be named forever.

21. Prepare ye slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.

22. And I will rise up against them, says Jehovah of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son's son, says Jehovah.

23. I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says Jehovah of hosts.

24. Jehovah of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought, so shall it come to pass, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand,

25. that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot upon my mountains. Then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder.

26. This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

27. For Jehovah of hosts has purposed, and who shall annul it? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

28. In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

29. Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken. For out of the serpent's root shall come forth an adder, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.

30. And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety. And I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain.

31. Howl, O gate, cry, O city. Thou are melted away, O Philistia, all of thee. For there comes a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.

32. What then shall a man answer the messengers of the nation? That Jehovah has founded Zion, and in her shall the afflicted of his people take refuge.

## Isaiah 15

1. The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. For in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing.

2. They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo, and over Medeba. On all their heads is baldness. Every beard is cut off.

3. In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth. On their housetops, and in their broad places, everyone wails, weeping abundantly.

4. And Heshbon cries out, and Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud. His soul trembles within him.

5. My heart cries out for Moab. Her nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah. For they go up with weeping by the ascent of Luhith. For they raise up a cry of destruction in the way of Horonaim.

6. For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate, for the grass is withered away. The tender grass fails. There is no green thing.

7. Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, they shall carry away over the brook of the willows.

8. For the cry has gone round about the borders of Moab, the wailing of it to Eglaim, and the wailing of it to Beer-elim.

9. For the waters of Dimon are full of blood. For I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon those of Moab who escape, and upon the remnant of the land.

## Isaiah 16

1. Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.

2. For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.

3. Give counsel, execute justice, make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday. Hide the outcasts. Do not betray the fugitive.

4. Let my outcasts dwell with thee. As for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land.

5. And a throne shall be established in loving kindness, and he shall sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.

6. We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud, even of his arrogance, and his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing.

7. Therefore Moab shall wail for Moab, everyone shall wail. Ye shall mourn for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth, utterly stricken.

8. For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches of it, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea.

9. Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh. for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the battle shout has fallen.

10. And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field. And in the vineyards there shall be no singing nor joyful noise. No treader shall tread out wine in the presses. I have made the vintage shout to cease.

11. Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-heres.

12. And it shall come to pass, when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.

13. This is the word that Jehovah spoke concerning Moab in time past.

14. But now Jehovah has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude. And the remnant shall be very small and of no account.

## Isaiah 17

1. The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

2. The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

3. And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus. And the remnant of Syria, they shall be as the glory of the sons of Israel, says Jehovah of hosts.

4. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall grow lean.

5. And it shall be as when the harvestman gathers the standing grain, and his arm reaps the ears. Yea, it shall be as when he gleans ears in the valley of Rephaim.

6. Yet there shall be gleanings left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree-two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, says Jehovah, the God of Israel.

7. In that day men shall look to their maker, and their eyes shall have respect for the Holy One of Israel.

8. And they shall not look to the altars, the work of their hands, nor shall they have respect for that which their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-images.

9. In that day their strong cities shall be as the forsaken places in the woodland and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the sons of Israel, and it shall be a desolation.

10. For thou have forgotten the God of thy salvation, and have not been mindful of the rock of thy strength. Therefore thou plant pleasant plants, and set it with foreign slips.

11. In the day of thy planting thou hedge it in, and in the morning thou make thy seed to blossom. But the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

12. Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas, and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!

13. The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters, but he shall rebuke them. And they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.

14. At eventide, behold, terror, and before the morning they are not. This is the portion of those who despoil us, and the lot of those who rob us.

## Isaiah 18

1. Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,

2. that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people fearful from their beginning onward, a nation that metes out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide!

3. All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye, and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye.

4. For thus Jehovah has said to me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

5. For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and he will take away and cut down the spreading branches.

6. They shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth. And the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.

7. In that time a present shall be brought to Jehovah of hosts from a people tall and smooth, even from a people fearful from their beginning onward, a nation that metes out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mount Zion.

## Isaiah 19

1. The burden of Egypt. Behold, Jehovah rides upon a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt. And the idols of Egypt shall tremble at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

2. And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they shall fight each one against his brother, and each one against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.

3. And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it, and I will destroy the counsel of it. And they shall seek for the idols, and for the charmers, and for those who have familiar spirits, and for the wizards.

4. And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. And a fierce king shall rule over them, says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.

5. And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.

6. And the rivers shall become foul. The streams of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags shall wither away.

7. The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.

8. And the fishermen shall lament, and all those who cast a hook into the Nile shall mourn, and those who spread nets upon the waters shall languish.

9. Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, shall be confounded.

10. And the pillars of Egypt shall be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire shall be grieved in soul.

11. The rulers of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become brutish. How will ye say to Pharaoh, I am the son of wise men, the son of ancient kings?

12. Where then are thy wise men? And let them tell thee now, and let them know what Jehovah of hosts has purposed concerning Egypt.

13. The rulers of Zoan have become fools. The rulers of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, the chief of her tribes.

14. Jehovah has mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her, and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work of it, as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.

15. Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.

16. In that day the Egyptians shall be like women, and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which he shakes over them.

17. And the land of Judah shall become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it shall be afraid because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, which he purposes against it.

18. In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Jehovah of hosts. One shall be called The city of destruction.

19. In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at the border of it.

20. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry to Jehovah because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior, and a defender, and he will deliver them.

21. And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day. Yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow to Jehovah, and shall perform it.

22. And Jehovah will smite Egypt, smiting and healing, and they shall return to Jehovah. And he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.

23. In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria. And the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.

24. In that day Israel shall be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,

25. in that Jehovah of hosts has blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.

## Isaiah 20

1. In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it,

2. at that time Jehovah spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put thy shoe from off thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

3. And Jehovah said, Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,

4. so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.

5. And they shall be dismayed and confounded because of Ethiopia their confidence, and of Egypt their glory.

6. And the inhabitant of this coastland shall say in that day, Behold, such is our trust, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. And we, how shall we escape?

## Isaiah 21

1. The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from a terrible land.

2. A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam. Besiege, O Media, all the sighing of it I have made to cease.

3. Therefore my loins are filled with anguish. Pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail. I am pained so that I cannot hear. I am dismayed so that I cannot see.

4. My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling to me.

5. They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink. Rise up, ye rulers, anoint the shield.

6. For thus has the Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.

7. and when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.

8. And he cried out as a lion, O Lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and am set in my ward whole nights,

9. and, behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon. And all the graven images of her gods are broken to the ground.

10. O my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.

11. The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

12. The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night. If ye will inquire, inquire ye; turn ye back, come.

13. The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia ye shall lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.

14. To him who was thirsty they brought water. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.

15. For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

16. For thus the Lord has said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail.

17. And the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, shall be few. For Jehovah, the God of Israel, has spoken it.

## Isaiah 22

1. The burden of the valley of vision. What troubles thee now, that thou have wholly gone up to the housetops?

2. O thou that are full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town. Thy slain are not slain with the sword, nor are they dead in battle.

3. All thy rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found of thee were bound together; they fled afar off.

4. Therefore I said, Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

5. For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.

6. And Elam bore the quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.

7. And it came to pass, that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.

8. And he took away the covering of Judah, and thou looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.

9. And ye saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many. And to fortify the wall, ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool,

10. and ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye broke down the houses.

11. Ye also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But ye did not look to him who had done this, nor had ye respect to him who purposed it long ago.

12. And in that day the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, called for weeping, and for mourning, and for baldness, and for girding with sackcloth.

13. And, behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine. Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.

14. And Jehovah of hosts revealed himself in my ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die, says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.

15. Thus says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, get thee to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,

16. What are thou doing here? And whom have thou here, that thou have hewed thee out here a sepulcher? Hewing him out a sepulcher on high, carving a habitation for himself in the rock!

17. Behold, Jehovah, like a strong man, will hurl thee away violently. Yea, he will wrap thee up closely.

18. He will surely wind thee round and round, tossing like a ball into a large country. There thou shall die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be, thou shame of thy lord's house.

19. And I will thrust thee from thine office, and thou shall be pulled down from thy station.

20. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah.

21. And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy belt. And I will commit thy government into his hand, and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.

22. And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he shall open, and none shall shut, and he shall shut, and none shall open.

23. And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place, and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father's house.

24. And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.

25. In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, the nail that was fastened in a sure place shall give way, and it shall be hewn down, and fall. And the burden that was upon it shall be cut off, for Jehovah has spoken it.

## Isaiah 23

1. The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. It is revealed to them from the land of Kittim.

2. Be still, ye inhabitants of the coast, thou whom the merchants of Sidon, who pass over the sea, have replenished.

3. And on great waters the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue, and she was the mart of nations.

4. Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.

5. When the report comes to Egypt, they shall be greatly pained at the report of Tyre.

6. Pass ye over to Tarshish. Wail, ye inhabitants of the coast.

7. Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her afar off to sojourn?

8. Who has purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are rulers, whose traders are the honored of the earth?

9. Jehovah of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.

10. Pass through thy land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish, there is no restraint any more.

11. He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. Jehovah has given commandment concerning Canaan, to destroy the strongholds of it.

12. And he said, Thou shall no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim, even there shall thou have no rest.

13. Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people once was not. The Assyrian founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They raised up the palaces of it. Then they made it a ruin.

14. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste.

15. And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it shall be to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:

16. Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot who has been forgotten. Make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou may be remembered.

17. And it came to pass after the end of seventy years, that Jehovah examined Tyre, and she has repented of her gift, that she play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.

18. And her merchandise and her pay shall be holiness to Jehovah. It shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her merchandise shall be for those who dwell before Jehovah, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

## Isaiah 24

1. Behold, Jehovah makes the earth empty, and makes it waste, and turns it upside down, and scatters abroad the inhabitants of it.

2. And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest, as with the servant, so with his master, as with the maid, so with her mistress, as with the buyer, so with the seller, as with the creditor, so with the debtor, as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.

3. The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly laid waste, for Jehovah has spoken this word.

4. The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.

5. The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants of it, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.

6. Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell in it are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.

7. The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted do sigh.

8. The mirth of tambourine ceases. The noise of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.

9. They shall not drink wine with a song. Strong drink shall be bitter to those who drink it.

10. The waste city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

11. There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.

12. Desolation is left in the city, and the gate is smitten with destruction.

13. For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.

14. These shall lift up their voice. They shall shout. For the majesty of Jehovah they cry aloud from the sea.

15. Therefore glorify ye Jehovah in the east, even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.

16. From the outermost part of the earth we have heard songs. Glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! The treacherous have dealt treacherously, yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.

17. Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.

18. And it shall come to pass, that he who flees from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit, and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare. For the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.

19. The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.

20. The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall sway to and fro like a hammock. And the transgression of it shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.

21. And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.

22. And they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison. And after many days they shall be visited.

23. Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, for Jehovah of hosts will reign in mount Zion and in Jerusalem. And glory shall be before his elders.

## Isaiah 25

1. O Jehovah, thou are my God. I will exalt thee. I will praise thy name. For thou have done wonderful things, even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.

2. For thou have made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It shall never be built.

3. Therefore a strong people shall glorify thee, a city of oppressive nations shall fear thee.

4. For thou have been a stronghold to a poor man, a stronghold to a needy man in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the oppressors is as a storm against the wall.

5. As the heat in a dry place thou will bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the oppressors shall be brought low.

6. And in this mountain Jehovah of hosts will make to all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the dregs, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the dregs well refined.

7. And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.

8. He will swallow up death in victory, and the lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces. And he will take away the reproach of his people from off all the earth. For Jehovah has spoken it.

9. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God. We have waited for him, and he will save us. This is Jehovah. We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

10. For the hand of Jehovah will rest on this mountain. And Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.

11. And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of it as he who swims spreads forth his hands to swim. But Jehovah will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.

12. And the high fortress of thy walls he has brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.

## Isaiah 26

1. In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city. He will appoint salvation for walls and bulwarks.

2. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps faith may enter in.

3. Thou will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusts in thee.

4. Trust ye in Jehovah forever, for in Jehovah, even Jehovah, is an everlasting rock.

5. For he has brought down those who dwell on high. The lofty city, he lays it low. He lays it low even to the ground. He brings it even to the dust.

6. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.

7. The way of the just is uprightness. Thou who are upright directs the path of the just.

8. Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, we have waited for thee, to thy name. Even to thy memorial, is the desire of our soul.

9. With my soul I have desired thee in the night. Yea, with my spirit within me I will seek thee earnestly. For when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

10. Let favor be shown to a wicked man, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.

11. Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, yet they do not see. But they shall see thy zeal for the people, and be put to shame. Yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.

12. Jehovah, thou will ordain peace for us, for thou have also wrought all our works for us.

13. O Jehovah our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us, but by thee only we will make mention of thy name.

14. Being dead, they shall not live. Being deceased, they shall not rise. Therefore thou have visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.

15. Thou have increased the nation, O Jehovah, thou have increased the nation. Thou are glorified. Thou have enlarged all the borders of the land.

16. Jehovah, in trouble they have visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

17. As a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs, so we have been before thee, O Jehovah.

18. We have been with child. We have been in pain. We have as it were brought forth wind. We have not wrought any deliverance in the earth, nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

19. Thy dead shall live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye who dwell in the dust, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.

20. Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors around thee. Hide thyself for a little moment until the indignation be passed over.

21. For, behold, Jehovah comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

## Isaiah 27

1. In that day Jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent, and he will kill the monster that is in the sea.

2. In that day is a vineyard of wine. Sing ye to it.

3. I Jehovah am its keeper, I will water it every moment. Lest any hurt it, I will guard it night and day.

4. Wrath is not in me. Would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march upon them. I would burn them together.

5. Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Yea, let him make peace with me.

6. In days to come Jacob shall take root; Israel shall blossom and bud. And they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.

7. Has he smitten them as he smote those who smote them? Or are they slain according to the slaughter of those who were slain by them?

8. In measure, in sending it forth, thou contend with it. He has removed with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.

9. Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob shall be forgiven. And this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten apart, so that the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.

10. For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken like the wilderness. There the calf shall feed, and there he shall lie down, and consume the branches of it.

11. When the boughs of it are withered, they shall be broken off. The women shall come, and set them on fire, for it is a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion upon them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.

12. And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will beat off his fruit, from the flood of the River to the brook of Egypt. And ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye sons of Israel.

13. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown. And they shall come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt. And they shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 28

1. Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome with wine!

2. Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one. As a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast down to the earth with the hand.

3. The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot.

4. And the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first-ripe fig before the summer, which, when he who looks upon it sees, while it is yet in his hand, he eats it up.

5. In that day Jehovah of hosts will become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,

6. and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

7. And even these reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink. They are swallowed up of wine. They stagger with strong drink; they err in vision; they stumble in judgment.

8. For all tables are full of vomit, filthiness, no place clean.

9. Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?

10. For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little.

11. No, but by men of strange lips and with another tongue he will speak to this people,

12. to whom he said, This is the rest. Give ye rest to him who is weary. And this is the refreshing. Yet they would not hear.

13. Therefore the word of Jehovah shall be to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little, that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

14. Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scoffers, who rule this people that is in Jerusalem.

15. Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we are at agreement with Sheol. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hid ourselves under falsehood.

16. Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation. He who believes in him shall, no, not be shamed.

17. And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet. And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.

18. And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.

19. As often as it passes though, it shall take you. For morning by morning it shall pass through, by day and by night. And it shall be nothing but terror to understand the report.

20. For the bed is shorter than what a man can stretch himself on it, and the covering narrower than what he can wrap himself in it.

21. For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

22. Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong. For I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.

23. Give ye ear, and hear my voice, hearken, and hear my speech.

24. Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he continually open and harrow his ground?

25. When he has leveled the face of it, does he not cast abroad the chick-peas, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in the border of it?

26. For his God instructs him aright, and teaches him.

27. For the chick-peas are not threshed with a sharp instrument, nor is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin, but the chick-peas are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.

28. Bread grain is ground, for he will not be always threshing it. And though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he does not grind it.

29. This also comes forth from Jehovah of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.

## Isaiah 29

1. Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add ye year to year. Let the feasts come round.

2. Then I will distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation, and she shall be to me as Ariel.

3. And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops. And I will raise siege works against thee.

4. And thou shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground. And thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be as of he who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground. And thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

5. But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passes away. Yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.

6. She shall be visited by Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.

7. And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.

8. And it shall be as when a hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats. But he awakes, and his soul is empty. Or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks. But he awakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite. So shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount Zion.

9. Tarry ye and wonder, take your pleasure and be blind. They are drunken, but not with wine. They stagger, but not with strong drink.

10. For Jehovah has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes. The prophets, and your heads, the seers, he has covered.

11. And all vision has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to a man who is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.

12. And the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I am not learned.

13. And the Lord said, Inasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me, but in vain they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men.

14. Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder. I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.

15. Woe to those who hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and who say, Who sees us? and, Who knows us?

16. Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay, that the thing made should say of him who made it, He did not make me, or the thing formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?

17. Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?

18. And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.

19. The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

20. For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases. And all those who watch for iniquity are cut off,

21. who make a man an offender in his cause, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nothing.

22. Therefore thus says Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now grow pale.

23. But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name. Yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.

24. They also who err in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmur shall receive instruction.

## Isaiah 30

1. Woe to the rebellious sons, says Jehovah, who take counsel, but not of me, and who make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,

2. who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!

3. Therefore the strength of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

4. For their rulers are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.

5. They shall all be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them, who are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

6. The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people who shall not profit them.

7. For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose. Therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still.

8. Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.

9. For it is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who will not hear the law of Jehovah,

10. who say to the seers, Do not see, and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things. Speak to us smooth things. Prophesy deceits.

11. Get you out of the way. Turn aside out of the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

12. Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it,

13. therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.

14. And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there shall not be found among the pieces of it a shard with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.

15. For thus said the lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, Ye shall be saved in returning and rest. Your strength shall be in quietness and in confidence. And ye would not,

16. but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses. Therefore ye shall flee. And ye said, We will ride upon the swift. Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.

17. One thousand shall flee at the threat of one. Ye shall flee at the threat of five, till ye are left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.

18. And therefore Jehovah will wait, that he may be gracious to you. And therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you, for Jehovah is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him.

19. For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. Thou shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry. When he shall hear, he will answer thee.

20. And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet thy teachers shall not be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.

21. And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.

22. And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold. Thou shall cast them away as an unclean thing. Thou shall say to it, Get thee away.

23. And he will give the rain for thy seed, with which thou shall sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day thy cattle shall feed in large pastures.

24. Likewise the oxen and the young donkeys that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.

25. And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, brooks and streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

26. Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the hurt of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.

27. Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire,

28. and his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. And a bridle that causes to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.

29. Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as he who goes with a pipe to come to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.

30. And Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the coming down of his arm with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast and tempest and hailstones.

31. For through the voice of Jehovah the Assyrian shall be dismayed. With his rod he will smite him.

32. And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with the sound of tambourine and harps. And he will fight with them in battles with the brandishing of his arm.

33. For a Topheth is prepared of old, yea, it is made ready for the king. He has made it deep and large. The pile of it is fire and much wood. The breath of Jehovah kindles it, like a stream of brimstone.

## Isaiah 31

1. Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek Jehovah!

2. Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.

3. Now the Egyptians are men, and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit. And when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they shall all be consumed together.

4. For thus says Jehovah to me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, even if a multitude of shepherds are called forth against him, he will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them, so Jehovah of hosts will come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill of it.

5. As birds hovering, so Jehovah of hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver. He will pass over and preserve.

6. Turn ye to him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O sons of Israel.

7. For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you for a sin.

8. And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man, and the sword, not of men, shall devour him. But he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to task work.

9. And his rock shall pass away because of terror, and his rulers shall be dismayed at the ensign, says Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 32

1. Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and rulers shall rule in justice.

2. And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.

3. And the eyes of those who see shall not be dim, and the ears of those who hear shall hearken.

4. And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

5. The fool shall no more be called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful.

6. For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice profaneness, and to utter error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

7. And the instruments of the churl are evil. He devises wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaks right.

8. But a noble man devises noble things, and in noble things he shall continue.

9. Rise up, ye women who are at ease. Hear my voice, ye careless daughters. Give ear to my speech.

10. For ye shall be troubled days beyond a year, ye careless women. For the vintage shall fail; the ingathering shall not come.

11. Tremble, ye women who are at ease. Be troubled, ye careless ones. Strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.

12. They shall beat upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

13. Thorns and briers shall come up on the land of my people, yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.

14. For the palace shall be forsaken. The populous city shall be deserted. The hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens forever, a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks,

15. until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest.

16. Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.

17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.

18. And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.

19. But it shall hail in the downfall of the forest, and the city shall be utterly laid low.

20. Blessed are ye who sow beside all waters, who send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey.

## Isaiah 33

1. Woe to thee who destroys, and thou were not destroyed, and deal treacherously, and they did not deal treacherously with thee! When thou have ceased to destroy, thou shall be destroyed, and when thou have made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.

2. O Jehovah, be gracious to us, we have waited for thee. Be thou our arm every morning, also our salvation in the time of trouble.

3. At the noise of the tumult the peoples have fled. At the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.

4. And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathers. As locusts leap, men shall leap upon it.

5. Jehovah is exalted, for he dwells on high. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

6. And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of Jehovah is thy treasure.

7. Behold, their valiant ones cry outside. The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.

8. The highways lie waste. The wayfaring man ceases. The enemy has broken the covenant. He has despised the cities. He does not regard man.

9. The land mourns and languishes. Lebanon is confounded and withers away. Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.

10. Now I will arise, says Jehovah. Now I will lift up myself. Now I will be exalted.

11. Ye shall conceive chaff. Ye shall bring forth stubble. Your breath is a fire that shall devour you.

12. And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down that are burned in the fire.

13. Hear, ye who are far off, what I have done, and ye who are near, acknowledge my might.

14. The sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the profane. Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?

15. He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly. He who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes away his hands from taking a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil.

16. He shall dwell on high. His place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks. His bread shall be given. His waters shall be sure.

17. Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty. They shall behold a land that reaches afar.

18. Thy heart shall muse on the terror. Where is he who counted? Where is he who weighed the tribute? Where is he who counted the towers?

19. Thou shall not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou cannot comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou cannot understand.

20. Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities. Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed. The stakes of which shall never be plucked up, nor shall any of the cords of it be broken.

21. But Jehovah will be with us there in majesty. A place of broad rivers and streams, in which shall go no galley with oars, nor shall a gallant ship pass thereby.

22. For Jehovah is our judge. Jehovah is our lawgiver. Jehovah is our king, he will save us.

23. Thy tacklings are loosed. They could not strengthen the foot of their mast. They could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great spoil was divided. The lame took the prey.

24. And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick. The people who dwell in it shall be forgiven their iniquity.

## Isaiah 34

1. Come near, ye nations, to hear. And hearken, ye peoples. Let the earth hear, and the fullness thereof, the world, and all things that come forth from it.

2. For Jehovah has indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host. He has utterly destroyed them. He has delivered them to the slaughter.

3. Their slain also shall be cast out. And the stench of their dead bodies shall come up, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

4. And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll. And all their host shall fade away as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as a fading leaf from the fig tree.

5. For my sword has drunk its fill in heaven. Behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.

6. The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood. It is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams, for Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

7. And the wild oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls. And their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

8. For Jehovah has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.

9. And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and the dust of it into brimstone. And the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

10. It shall not be quenched night nor day. The smoke of it shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste. None shall pass through it forever and ever.

11. But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it. And the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. And he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.

12. They shall call the nobles of it to the kingdom, but none shall be there. And all its rulers shall be nothing.

13. And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses of it. And it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.

14. And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves. And the wild goat shall cry to his fellow. Yea, the screech owl shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.

15. There the dart-snake shall make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade. Yea, there the vultures shall be gathered, each one with her mate.

16. Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read. No one of these shall be missing. None shall want her mate. For my mouth, it has commanded, and his Spirit, it has gathered them.

17. And he has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it to them by line. They shall possess it forever. From generation to generation they shall dwell therein.

## Isaiah 35

1. The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad. And the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

2. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.

3. Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

4. Say to those who are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.

5. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

6. Then the lame man shall leap as a hart, and the tongue of the mute shall sing. For waters in the wilderness shall break out, and streams in the desert.

7. And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water. In the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

8. And a highway shall be there, and a way. And it shall be called The way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for the redeemed, the wayfaring men. Yea fools shall not err in it.

9. No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up in it. They shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there.

10. And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing to Zion. And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. They shall obtain gladness and joy. And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

## Isaiah 36

1. Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.

2. And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.

3. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came forth to him, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.

4. And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this in which thou trust?

5. I say, thy counsel and strength for the war are but vain words. Now on whom do thou trust that thou have rebelled against me?

6. Behold, thou trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.

7. But if thou say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God. Is that not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?

8. Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

9. How then can thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

10. And have I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

11. Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. And speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.

12. But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?

13. Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

14. Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.

15. Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us. This city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

16. Hearken not to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me, and eat ye everyone of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and drink ye everyone the waters of his own cistern,

17. until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

18. Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

19. Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

20. Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

21. But they held their peace, and answered him not a word. For the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

22. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

## Isaiah 37

1. And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.

2. And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

3. And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy, for the sons have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

4. It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God has heard. Therefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.

5. So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

6. And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus says Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

7. Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear news, and shall return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

8. So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

9. And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trust deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

11. Behold, thou have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. And shall thou be delivered?

12. Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?

13. Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?

14. And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.

15. And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,

16. O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, thou are the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou have made heaven and earth.

17. Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear. Open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.

18. Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,

19. and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.

20. Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou are Jehovah, even thou only.

21. Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,

22. this is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised thee and laughed thee to scorn. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.

23. Whom have thou defied and blasphemed? And against whom have thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.

24. By thy servants thou have defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. And I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and the choice fir trees of it, and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field.

25. I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.

26. Have thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.

27. Therefore their inhabitants were of small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb. As the grass on the housetops, and as a field of grain before it is grown up.

28. But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.

29. Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou came.

30. And this shall be the sign to thee. Ye shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same, and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of it.

31. And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

32. For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.

33. Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there. Neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.

34. By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come to this city, says Jehovah.

35. For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

36. And the agent of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.

37. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

38. And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

## Isaiah 38

1. In those days Hezekiah was sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Set thy house in order, for thou shall die, and not live.

2. Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah,

3. and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept greatly.

4. Then the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying,

5. Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David thy father. I have heard thy prayer. I have seen thy tears. Behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.

6. And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.

7. And this shall be the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he has spoken:

8. Behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which has gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial on which it had gone down.

9. The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:

10. I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of Sheol. I am deprived of the residue of my years.

11. I said, I shall not see Jehovah, even Jehovah in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.

12. My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life. He will cut me off from the loom. From day even to night thou will make an end of me.

13. I quieted myself until morning. As a lion, so he breaks all my bones. From day even to night will thou make an end of me.

14. Like a swallow or a crane, so I chattered. I moaned as a dove. My eyes fail with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed, be thou my surety.

15. What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it. I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.

16. O Lord, by these things men live, and wholly therein is the life of my spirit. Therefore recover thou me, and make me to live.

17. Behold, for peace I had great bitterness. But thou have by love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption. For thou have cast all my sins behind thy back.

18. For Sheol cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee. Those who go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.

19. The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day. The father to the sons shall make known thy truth.

20. Jehovah is ready to save me. Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.

21. Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.

22. Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?

## Isaiah 39

1. At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

2. And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.

3. Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? And from where did they come to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.

4. Then he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.

5. Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:

6. Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.

7. And of thy sons who shall issue from thee, whom thou shall beget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

8. Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Jehovah which thou have spoken is good. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

## Isaiah 40

1. Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, says your God.

2. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare has been completed, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Jehovah's hand double for all her sins.

3. The voice of a man crying out in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

4. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. And the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places smooth.

5. And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.

6. The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness of it is as the flower of the field.

7. The grass withers, the flower fades, because the breath of Jehovah blows upon it. Surely the people is grass.

8. The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God shall stand forever.

9. O thou who tell good news to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain. O thou who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength. Lift it up, be not afraid, say to the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!

10. Behold, the lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.

11. He will feed his flock like a shepherd. He will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and will gently lead those who have their young.

12. Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

13. Who has known the mind of Jehovah, or being his counselor has taught him?

14. With whom did he take counsel. And who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice. And taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?

15. Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance. Behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.

16. And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts of it sufficient for a burnt offering.

17. All the nations are as nothing before him. They are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.

18. To whom then will ye liken God? Or what likeness will ye compare to him?

19. The image, a workman has cast it, and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts for it silver chains.

20. He who is too impoverished for such an oblation chooses a tree that will not rot. He seeks for him a skilful workman to set up a graven image that shall not be moved.

21. Have ye not known? Have yet not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?

22. It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers, who stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in,

23. who brings rulers to nothing, who makes the judges of the earth as vanity.

24. Yea, they have not been planted. Yea, they have not been sown. Yea, their stock has not taken root in the earth. Moreover he blows upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.

25. To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to him? says the Holy One.

26. Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their host by number. He calls them all by name, by the greatness of his might. And because he is strong in power, not one is lacking.

27. Why do thou say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah. And the justice due to me is passed away from my God?

28. Have thou not known? Have thou not heard? The everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, nor is weary. There is no searching of his understanding.

29. He gives power to the faint. And to him who has no might he increases strength.

30. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.

31. But those who wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run, and not be weary. They shall walk, and not faint.

## Isaiah 41

1. Keep silence before me, O islands, and let the peoples renew their strength. Let them come near, then let them speak. Let us come near together to judgment.

2. Who raised up the righteous man from the east, calls him to his foot, gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings? He gives them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow.

3. He pursues them, and passes on safely, even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.

4. Who has wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, the first, and with the last, I am he.

5. The isles have seen, and fear. The ends of the earth tremble, they draw near, and come.

6. They help every man his neighbor, and says to his brother, Be of good courage.

7. So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith, he who smoothes with the hammer, him who smites the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good, and he fastens it with nails, that it should not be moved.

8. But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,

9. thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners thereof, and said to thee, Thou are my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away.

10. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee. Yea, I will help thee. Yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

11. Behold, all those who are incensed against thee shall be put to shame and confounded. Those who strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.

12. Thou shall seek them, and shall not find them, even those who contend with thee. Those who war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of naught.

13. For I, Jehovah thy God, will hold thy right hand, saying to thee, Fear not, I will help thee.

14. Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel. I will help thee, says Jehovah, and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

15. Behold, I have made thee as a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth. Thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.

16. Thou shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them. And thou shall rejoice in Jehovah. Thou shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.

17. The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst. I, Jehovah, will answer them. I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.

18. I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

19. I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil tree. I will set in the desert the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together,

20. that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.

21. Produce your case, says Jehovah. Bring forth your strong reasons, says the King of Jacob.

22. Let them bring forth, and declare to us what shall happen. Declare ye the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them, or show us things to come.

23. Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods. Yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.

24. Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work is of naught. An abomination is he who chooses you.

25. I have raised up him from the north, and he has come, him who calls upon my name from the rising of the sun. And he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the potter treads clay.

26. Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know, and beforetime, that we may say, He is right? Yea, there is none who declares. Yea, there is none who shows. Yea, there is none who hears your words.

27. First to Zion. Behold, behold them, and I will give to Jerusalem him who brings good news.

28. And when I look, there is no man. Even among them there is no counselor, that, when I ask of them, can answer a word.

29. Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing. Their molten images are wind and confusion.

## Isaiah 42

1. Behold, my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him, he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.

2. He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.

3. A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench, but he will bring forth justice in truth.

4. He will not fail nor be discouraged till he has set justice in the earth. And in his name Gentiles will hope.

5. Thus says God, Jehovah, he who created the heavens, and stretched them forth, he who spread abroad the earth and that which comes out of it, he who gives breath to the people upon it, and spirit to those who walk in it,

6. I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles,

7. to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison-house.

8. I am Jehovah. That is my name, and I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven images.

9. Behold, the former things have come to pass, and I declare new things. Before they spring forth I tell you of them.

10. Sing to Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye who go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

11. Let the wilderness and the cities of it lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing. Let them shout from the top of the mountains.

12. Let them give glory to Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands.

13. Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man. He will stir up his zeal like a man of war. He will cry, yea, he will shout aloud. He will do mightily against his enemies.

14. I have for a long time held my peace. I have been still, and refrained myself. Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will gasp and pant together.

15. I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs. And I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.

16. And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not. I will lead them in paths that they know not. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things I will do, and I will not forsake them.

17. They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, who trust in graven images, who say to molten images, Ye are our gods.

18. Hear, ye deaf, and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

19. Who is blind, but my servant, or deaf, as my messenger that I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace with me, and blind as Jehovah's servant?

20. Thou see many things, but thou do not observe. His ears are open, but he does not hear.

21. It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.

22. But this is a people robbed and plundered. They are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses. They are for a prey, and none delivers, for a spoil, and none says, Restore.

23. Who is there among you that will give ear to this, that will hearken and hear for the time to come?

24. Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not Jehovah? He against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, nor were they obedient to his law.

25. Therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle. And it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not. And it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

## Isaiah 43

1. But now thus says Jehovah who created thee, O Jacob, and he who formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee. I have called thee by thy name, Thou are mine.

2. When thou pass through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee. When thou walk through the fire, thou shall not be burned, nor shall the flame kindle upon thee.

3. For I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior. I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.

4. Since thou have been precious in my sight, and honorable, and I have loved thee, therefore I will give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.

5. Fear not, for I am with thee. I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west.

6. I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Keep not back. Bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth,

7. everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.

8. Bring forth the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.

9. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled. Who among them can declare this, and show us former things? Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified, or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

10. Ye are my witnesses, says Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he. Before me there was no God formed, nor shall there be after me.

11. I, even I, am Jehovah, and besides me there is no savior.

12. I have declared, and I have saved, and I have shown, and there was no strange god among you. Therefore ye are my witnesses, says Jehovah, and I am God.

13. Yea, since the day was I am he, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. I will work, and who can hinder it?

14. Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.

15. I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.

16. Thus says Jehovah, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters,

17. who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together; they shall not rise; they are extinct; they are quenched as a wick):

18. Do not remember ye the former things, nor consider the things of old.

19. Behold, I will do a new thing. Now it shall spring forth. Shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

20. The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,

21. the people whom I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.

22. Yet thou have not called upon me, O Jacob, but thou have been weary of me, O Israel.

23. Thou have not brought me from thy sheep for burnt offerings, nor have thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.

24. Thou have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices. But thou have burdened me with thy sins. Thou have wearied me with thine iniquities.

25. I, even I, am he who blots out thy transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember thy sins.

26. Put me in remembrance. Let us plead together. Set thou forth thy case that thou may be justified.

27. Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.

28. Therefore I will profane the rulers of the sanctuary, and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.

## Isaiah 44

1. Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen.

2. Thus says Jehovah who made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob my servant, and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.

3. For I will pour water upon him who is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground. I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.

4. And they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.

5. One shall say, I am Jehovah's, and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his hand to Jehovah, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

6. Thus says Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.

7. And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? And let them declare the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass.

8. Fear ye not, nor be afraid. Have I not declared to thee of old, and shown it? And ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Yea, there is no Rock. I know not any.

9. Those who fashion a graven image are all of them vanity. And the things that they delight in shall not profit. And their own witnesses see not, nor know, that they may be put to shame.

10. Who has fashioned a god, or molded an image that is profitable for nothing?

11. Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame, and the workmen. They are of men. Let them all be gathered together. Let them stand up. They shall fear. They shall be put to shame together.

12. The smith makes an axe, and works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. Yea, he is hungry, and his strength fails. He drinks no water, and is faint.

13. The carpenter stretches out a line. He marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes. And he marks it out with the compasses, and shapes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.

14. He hews down cedars for him, and takes the holm tree and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain nourishes it.

15. Then it shall be for a man to burn. And he takes of it, and warms himself. Yea, he kindles it, and bakes bread. Yea, he makes a god, and worships it. He makes it a graven image, and falls down to it.

16. He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it he eats flesh. He roasts roast, and is satisfied. Yea, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.

17. And the residue of it he makes a god, even his graven image. He falls down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me, for thou are my god.

18. They do not know, nor do they consider. For he has shut their eyes, that they cannot see, and their hearts, that they cannot understand.

19. And none calls to mind, nor is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire. Yea, I have also baked bread upon the coals of it. I have roasted flesh and eaten it. And shall I make the residue of it an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?

20. He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside. And he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?

21. Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou are my servant. I have formed thee. Thou are my servant, O Israel, thou shall not be forgotten by me.

22. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins. Return to me, for I have redeemed thee.

23. Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah has done it. Shout, ye lower parts of the earth. Break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein. For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.

24. Thus says Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and he who formed thee from the womb: I am Jehovah, who makes all things, who stretches forth the heavens alone, who spreads abroad the earth (who is with me?),

25. who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad, who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish,

26. who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited, and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places of it,

27. who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers,

28. who says of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built, and of the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

## Isaiah 45

1. Thus says Jehovah to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held to subdue nations before him. And I will loose the loins of kings to open the doors before him. And the gates shall not be shut.

2. I will go before thee, and make the rough places smooth. I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut apart the bars of iron.

3. And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou may know that it is I, Jehovah, who call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel.

4. For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my chosen, I have called thee by thy name. I have surnamed thee, though thou have not known me.

5. I am Jehovah, and there is none else. Besides me there is no God. I will gird thee, though thou have not known me,

6. that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me. I am Jehovah, and there is none else.

7. I form the light, and create darkness. I make peace, and create evil. I am Jehovah who does all these things.

8. Distil, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness. Let the earth open that it may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together. I, Jehovah, have created it.

9. Woe to him who strives with his maker, a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashions it, What are thou making? or thy work, He has no hands?

10. Woe to him who says to a father, What are thou begetting? or to a woman, With what are thou travailing?

11. Thus says Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel and his maker: Ask me of the things that are to come concerning my sons. And command ye me concerning the work of my hands.

12. I have made the earth, and created man upon it. I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host I have commanded.

13. I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways. He shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, says Jehovah of hosts.

14. Thus says Jehovah: The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to thee, and they shall be thine. They shall go after thee. In chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to thee. They shall make supplication to thee, saying, Surely God is in thee, and there is none else, no God.

15. Verily thou are a God who hides thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior.

16. They shall be put to shame, yea, confounded, all of them. They shall go into confusion together who are makers of idols.

17. But Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation. Ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end.

18. For thus says Jehovah who created the heavens, the God who formed the earth and made it, who established it and did not create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and there is none else.

19. I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. I, Jehovah, speak righteousness. I declare things that are right.

20. Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations. They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god that cannot save.

21. Declare ye, and bring it forth. Yea, let them take counsel together. Who has shown this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Have not I, Jehovah? And there is no other God besides me, a just God and a Savior. There is none besides me.

22. Look to me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.

23. By myself I have sworn, the word has gone forth from my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue will confess to God.

24. Only in Jehovah, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength. Even to him men shall come, and all those who were incensed against him shall be put to shame.

25. In Jehovah all the seed of Israel shall be justified, and shall glory.

## Isaiah 46

1. Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle. The things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast.

2. They stoop, they bow down together. They could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

3. Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from their birth, who have been carried from the womb.

4. And even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear, yea, I will carry, and will deliver.

5. To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?

6. Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god. They fall down, yea, they worship.

7. They bear it upon the shoulder. They carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands. From its place it shall not remove. Yea, he may cry to it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

8. Remember this, and show yourselves men. Bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.

9. Remember the former things of old, for I am God, and there is none else. I am God, and there is none like me,

10. declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure,

11. calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. Yea, I have spoken. I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed. I will also do it.

12. Hearken to me, ye stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:

13. I bring near my righteousness. It shall not be far off. And my salvation shall not tarry, and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.

## Isaiah 47

1. Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon. Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For thou shall no more be called tender and delicate.

2. Take the millstones, and grind meal. Remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.

3. Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.

4. Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.

5. Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans, for thou shall no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.

6. I was angry with my people. I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into thy hand. Thou showed them no mercy. Upon the aged thou have laid thy yoke very heavily.

7. And thou said, I shall be mistress forever, so that thou did not lay these things to thy heart, nor remembered the latter end of it.

8. Now therefore hear this, thou who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me. I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of sons.

9. But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day: the loss of sons, and widowhood. In their full measure they shall come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.

10. For thou have trusted in thy wickedness. Thou have said, None sees me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it has perverted thee. And thou have said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.

11. Therefore evil shall come upon thee. Thou shall not know the dawning of it. And mischief shall fall upon thee. Thou shall not be able to put it away. And desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou know not.

12. Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou have labored from thy youth, if so be thou shall be able to profit, if so be thou may prevail.

13. Thou are wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.

14. Behold, they shall be as stubble. The fire shall burn them. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame. It shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.

15. Thus shall be the things to thee, in which thou have labored. Those who have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander each one to his quarter. There shall be none to save thee.

## Isaiah 48

1. Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of Jehovah, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness

2. (for they call themselves of the holy city, and steady themselves upon the God of Israel, Jehovah of hosts is his name):

3. I have declared the former things from of old. Yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them. Suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.

4. Because I knew that thou are obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass,

5. therefore I have declared it to thee from of old. Before it came to pass I showed it to thee, lest thou should say, My idol has done them. And my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.

6. Thou have heard it, behold all this, and ye, will ye not declare it? I have shown thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou have not known.

7. They are created now, and not from of old. And thou have not heard them before this day, lest thou should say, Behold, I knew them.

8. Yea, thou heard not. Yea, thou knew not. Yea, from of old thine ear was not opened. For I knew that thou dealt very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.

9. For my name's sake I will defer my anger, and for my praise I will refrain for thee, that I not cut thee off.

10. Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver. I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

11. For my own sake, for my own sake, I will do it. For how should my name be profaned? And I will not give my glory to another.

12. Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he. I am the first. I also am the last.

13. Yea, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens. When I call to them, they stand up together.

14. Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear: Who among them has declared these things? He whom Jehovah loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm, the Chaldeans.

15. I, even I, have spoken, yea, I have called him. I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

16. Come ye near to me, hear ye this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret. From the time that it was, there I am. And now the lord Jehovah and his Spirit has sent me.

17. Thus says Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah thy God, who teaches thee to profit, who leads thee by the way that thou should go.

18. Oh that thou had hearkened to my commandments! Then thy peace would have been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.

19. Thy seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains of it. His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.

20. Go ye forth from Babylon. Flee ye from the Chaldeans. With a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth. Say ye, Jehovah has redeemed his servant Jacob.

21. And they did not thirst when he led them through the deserts. He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them. He also split the rock, and the waters gushed out.

22. There is no peace, says Jehovah, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 49

1. Listen, O isles, to me, and hearken, ye peoples from far. Jehovah has called me from the womb. From the bowels of my mother he has made mention of my name.

2. And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword. He has hid me in the shadow of his hand, and he has made me a polished shaft. He has kept me close in his quiver.

3. And he said to me, Thou are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.

4. But I said, I have labored in vain. I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity. Yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah, and my recompense with my God.

5. And now says Jehovah who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered to him (for I am honorable in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God has become my strength),

6. yea, he says, It is too light a thing that thou should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou may be my salvation to the end of the earth.

7. Thus says Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers. Kings shall see and arise, rulers, and they shall worship, because of Jehovah who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen thee.

8. Thus says Jehovah, In an acceptable time I have heard thee, and in a day of salvation I have helped thee. And I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages,

9. saying to those who are bound, Go forth; to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pasture shall be on all bare heights.

10. They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them. For he who has mercy on them will lead them. He will guide them even by springs of water.

11. And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.

12. Lo, these shall come from far, and, lo, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Sinim.

13. Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into singing, O mountains. For Jehovah has comforted his people, and will have compassion upon his afflicted.

14. But Zion said, Jehovah has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.

15. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, these may forget, yet I will not forget thee.

16. Behold, I have engraved thee upon the palms of my hands. Thy walls are continually before me.

17. Thy sons make haste. Thy destroyers and those who made thee waste shall go forth from thee.

18. Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold. All these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, says Jehovah, thou shall surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and gird thyself with them, like a bride.

19. For, as for thy waste and thy desolate places, and thy land that has been destroyed, surely now thou shall be too narrow for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed thee up shall be far away.

20. The sons of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too narrow for me. Give a place to me that I may dwell.

21. Then thou shall say in thy heart, Who has begotten these for me, seeing I have been bereaved of my sons, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? And who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone, these, where were they?

22. Thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples. And they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.

23. And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers. They shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet. And thou shall know that I am Jehovah, and those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.

24. Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?

25. But thus says Jehovah, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered. For I will contend with him who contends with thee, and I will save thy sons.

26. And I will feed those who oppress thee with their own flesh. And they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine. And all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

## Isaiah 50

1. Thus says Jehovah, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, with which I have put her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities ye were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was put away.

2. Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness. Their fish stink because there is no water, and die for thirst.

3. I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

4. The lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary. He awakens morning by morning. He awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.

5. The lord Jehovah has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backward.

6. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.

7. For the lord Jehovah will help me. Therefore I have not been confounded. Therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.

8. He is near who justifies me. Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.

9. Behold, the lord Jehovah will help me. Who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall grow old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.

10. Who is among you that fears Jehovah, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.

11. Behold, all ye who kindle a fire, who gird yourselves about with firebrands, walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This ye shall have from my hand. Ye shall lie down in sorrow.

## Isaiah 51

1. Hearken to me, ye who follow after righteousness, ye who seek Jehovah. Look to the rock from where ye were hewn, and to the hold of the pit from where ye were dug.

2. Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you. For when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.

3. For Jehovah has comforted Zion. He has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

4. Attend to me, O my people, and give ear to me, O my nation. For a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.

5. My righteousness is near. My salvation has gone forth, and my arms shall judge the peoples. The isles shall wait for me, and on my arm they shall trust.

6. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath. For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall grow old like a garment, and those who dwell in it shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

7. Hearken to me, ye who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law. Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be ye dismayed at their revilings.

8. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation to all generations.

9. Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah. Awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the monster?

10. Is it not thou who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?

11. And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing to Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. They shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

12. I, even I, am he who comforts you. Who are thou, that thou are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall be made as grass,

13. and have forgotten Jehovah thy maker, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?

14. The captive exile shall speedily be loosed, and he shall not die in the pit, nor shall his bread fail.

15. For I am Jehovah thy God, who stirs up the sea so that the waves of it roar. Jehovah of hosts is his name.

16. And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, Thou are my people.

17. Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, who have drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath. Thou have drunk the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.

18. There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth, nor is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons that she has brought up.

19. These two things have befallen thee (Who shall bemoan thee?): Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword. How shall I comfort thee?

20. Thy sons have fainted. They lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net. They are full of the wrath of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God.

21. Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine.

22. Thus says thy lord Jehovah, and thy God who pleads the cause of his people: Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath. Thou shall no more drink it again.

23. And I will put it into the hand of those who afflict thee, who have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over, and thou have laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to those who go over.

## Isaiah 52

1. Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion. Put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

2. Shake thyself from the dust. Arise, sit up, O Jerusalem. Loose thyself from the bonds of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

3. For thus says Jehovah: Ye were sold for nothing, and ye shall be redeemed without money.

4. For thus says the lord Jehovah, My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there. And the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.

5. Now therefore, what do I do here, says Jehovah, seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them howl, says Jehovah, and because of you my name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles.

6. Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks, Behold, it is I.

7. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Thy God reigns!

8. The voice of thy watchmen! They lift up the voice; they sing together. For they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah returns to Zion.

9. Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem, for Jehovah has comforted his people. He has redeemed Jerusalem.

10. Jehovah has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

11. Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from there. Touch no unclean thing. Go ye out of the midst of her. Cleanse yourselves, ye who bear the vessels of Jehovah.

12. For ye shall not go out in haste, nor shall ye go by flight. For Jehovah will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rearward.

13. Behold, my servant shall deal wisely. He shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.

14. Just as many were astonished at thee (his visage was so marred, more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),

15. so shall he sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths at him. For that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall understand.

## Isaiah 53

1. Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?

2. For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. He has no form nor comeliness. And when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.

3. He was despised, and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And as him from whom men hide their face he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

4. Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. Yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.

5. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.

6. All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned every one to his own way, and Jehovah has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

7. He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth. As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that is mute before its shearers, so he opened not his mouth.

8. In his humiliation his justice was taken away. And as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due?

9. And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death. Although he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.

10. Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him. He has put him to grief. When thou shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.

11. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied. By the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many, and he shall bear their iniquities.

12. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors. Yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

## Isaiah 54

1. Sing, O barren, thou who did not bear. Break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou who did not travail with child. For more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married woman, says Jehovah.

2. Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations. Spare not. Lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.

3. For thou shall spread abroad on the right hand and on the left. And thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.

4. Fear not, for thou shall not be ashamed. Neither be thou confounded, for thou shall not be put to shame. For thou shall forget the shame of thy youth. And the reproach of thy widowhood thou shall remember no more.

5. For thy maker is thy husband. Jehovah of hosts is his name. And the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer. He shall be called the God of the whole earth.

6. For Jehovah has called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth when she is cast off, says thy God.

7. For a small moment I have forsaken thee, but with great mercies I will gather thee.

8. In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting loving kindness I will have mercy on thee, says Jehovah thy Redeemer.

9. For this is as the waters of Noah to me. For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee.

10. For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed, but my loving kindness shall not depart from thee, nor shall my covenant of peace be removed, says Jehovah who has mercy on thee.

11. O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.

12. And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.

13. And all thy sons shall be taught of Jehovah, and great shall be the peace of thy sons.

14. Thou shall be established in righteousness. Thou shall be far from oppression, for thou shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.

15. Behold, they may gather together, but not by me. Whoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.

16. Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work. And I have created the waster to destroy.

17. No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper. And every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, says Jehovah.

## Isaiah 55

1. Ho, everyone who thirsts, come ye to the waters. And he who has no money, come ye, buy, and eat. Yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

2. Why do ye spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Hearken diligently to me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

3. Incline your ear, and come to me. Hear, and your soul shall live. And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the faithful holy things of David.

4. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.

5. Behold, thou shall call a nation that thou do not know. And a nation that does not know thee shall run to thee because of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified thee.

6. Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found. Call ye upon him while he is near.

7. Let the wicked man forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts. And let him return to Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

8. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says Jehovah.

9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

10. For as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater,

11. so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth. It shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please. And it shall prosper in the thing to which I sent it.

12. For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.

13. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree. And it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

## Isaiah 56

1. Thus says Jehovah, Keep ye justice, and do righteousness. For my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.

2. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the sabbath from profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.

3. Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah will surely separate me from his people, nor let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.

4. For thus says Jehovah of the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:

5. To them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters. I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

6. Also the foreigners who join themselves to Jehovah, to minister to him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be his servants, everyone who keeps the sabbath from profaning it, and holds fast my covenant,

7. even them I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar, for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.

8. The lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet I will gather to him, besides his own who are gathered.

9. All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.

10. His watchmen are blind. They are all without knowledge. They are all mute dogs. They cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.

11. Yea, the dogs are greedy; they can never have enough. And these are shepherds who cannot understand. They have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.

12. Come ye, they say, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink. And tomorrow shall be as this day, great beyond measure.

## Isaiah 57

1. The righteous man perishes, and no man lays it to heart. And merciful men are taken away; none considering that the righteous man is taken away from the evil.

2. He enters into peace. They rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.

3. But draw near here, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.

4. Against whom do ye sport yourselves, against whom ye make a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? Are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,

5. ye who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree, who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?

6. Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion. They, they are thy lot, even to them thou have poured a drink offering; thou have offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?

7. Upon a high and lofty mountain thou have set thy bed. Thou also went up there to offer sacrifice.

8. And behind the doors and the posts thou have set up thy memorial. For thou have uncovered thyself to another than me, and have gone up. Thou have enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them. Thou loved their bed where thou saw it.

9. And thou went to the king with oil, and increased thy perfumes, and sent thine ambassadors far off, and debased thyself even to Sheol.

10. Thou were wearied with the length of thy way, yet thou did not say, It is in vain. Thou found a quickening of thy strength, therefore thou were not faint.

11. And of whom have thou been afraid and in fear, that thou lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? Have I not held my peace even of long time, and thou do not fear me?

12. I will declare thy righteousness. And as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.

13. When thou cry, let those whom thou have gathered deliver thee. But the wind shall take them; a breath shall carry them all away. But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.

14. And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way. Take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.

15. For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, also with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.

16. For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry, for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made.

17. For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and smote him. I hid my face and was angry, and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.

18. I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.

19. I create the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near, says Jehovah, and I will heal him.

20. But the wicked are like the troubled sea, for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.

21. There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 58

1. Cry aloud, spare not. Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.

2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways. As a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.

3. Why have we fasted, they say, and thou see not? We have afflicted our soul, and thou take no knowledge. Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact from all your laborers.

4. Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. Ye do not fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.

5. Is such the fast that I have chosen, the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?

6. Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?

7. Is it not to deal thy bread to a hungry man, and that thou bring the poor who are cast out to thy house, when thou see a naked man, that thou cover him, and that thou not hide thyself from thine own flesh?

8. Then thy light shall break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily. And thy righteousness shall go before thee. The glory of Jehovah shall be thy rearward.

9. Then thou shall call, and Jehovah will answer, thou shall cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take the yoke away from the midst of thee, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly,

10. and if thou draw out thy soul to a hungry man, and satisfy an afflicted soul, then thy light shall rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday.

11. And Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones. And thou shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters fail not.

12. And those who shall be of thee shall build the old waste places. Thou shall raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

13. If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of Jehovah honorable, and shall honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:

14. then thou shall delight thyself in Jehovah, and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.

## Isaiah 59

1. Behold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, nor his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.

2. But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you so that he will not hear.

3. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies. Your tongue mutters wickedness.

4. No man sues in righteousness, and no man pleads in truth. They trust in vanity, and speak lies. They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.

5. They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web. He who eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.

6. Their webs shall not become garments, nor shall they cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

7. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. Desolation and destruction are in their paths.

8. They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their goings. They have made them crooked paths. Whoever goes in it does not know peace.

9. Therefore justice is far from us, nor does righteousness overtake us. We look for light, but behold, darkness, for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.

10. We grope for the wall like the blind. Yea, we grope as those who have no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the twilight. We are as dead men in desolate places.

11. We all roar like bears, and moan greatly like doves. We look for justice, but there is none, for salvation, but it is far off from us.

12. For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:

13. transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

14. And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off. For truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.

15. Yea, truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.

16. And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him. And his righteousness, it upheld him.

17. And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head. And he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.

18. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. He will repay recompense to the islands.

19. So they shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. For he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah drives.

20. And he who redeems will come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.

21. And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says Jehovah: My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, says Jehovah, from henceforth and forever.

## Isaiah 60

1. Arise, shine, for thy light has come, and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon thee.

2. For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples. But Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.

3. And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.

4. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see. They all gather themselves together. They come to thee. Thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.

5. Then thou shall see and be radiant, and thy heart shall thrill and be enlarged, because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to thee. The wealth of the nations shall come to thee.

6. The multitude of camels shall cover thee. The dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.

7. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to thee. The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee. They shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.

8. Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?

9. Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified thee.

10. And foreigners shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister to thee. For in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor I have had mercy on thee.

11. Thy gates also shall be open continually. They shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring to thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.

12. For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish. Yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

13. The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary. And I will make the place of my feet glorious.

14. And the sons of those who afflicted thee shall come bending to thee. And all those who despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet. And they shall call thee The city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

15. Whereas thou have been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.

16. Thou shall also suck the milk of the nations, and shall suck the breast of kings. And thou shall know that I, Jehovah, am thy Savior, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

17. For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine overseers righteousness.

18. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders, but thou shall call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.

19. The sun shall no more be thy light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give light to thee, but Jehovah will be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.

20. Thy sun shall no more go down, nor shall thy moon withdraw itself, for Jehovah will be thine everlasting light. And the days of thy mourning shall be ended.

21. Thy people also shall all be righteous. They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

22. The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation. I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.

## Isaiah 61

1. The Spirit of the lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, and the opening of bonds to those who are bound,

2. to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,

3. to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified.

4. And they shall build the old wastes. They shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.

5. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

6. But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah. Men shall call you the ministers of our God. Ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory ye shall boast yourselves.

7. Instead of your shame ye shall have double, and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion. Therefore in their land they shall possess double. Everlasting joy shall be to them.

8. For I, Jehovah, love justice. I hate robbery with iniquity. And I will give them their recompense in truth. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

9. And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Jehovah has blessed.

10. I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah. My soul shall be joyful in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation. He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

11. For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

## Isaiah 62

1. For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burns.

2. And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory. And thou shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.

3. Thou shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

4. Thou shall no more be termed Forsaken, nor shall thy land any more be termed Desolate. But thou shall be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah, for Jehovah delights in thee, and thy land shall be married.

5. For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee. And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.

6. I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem. They shall never keep silent day nor night. Ye who are Jehovah's reminders, take ye no rest,

7. and give him no rest, till he establishes, and till he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

8. Jehovah has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies, and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou have labored.

9. But those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah. And those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.

10. Go through, go through the gates. Prepare ye the way of the people. Cast up, cast up the highway. Gather out the stones. Lift up an ensign for the peoples.

11. Behold, Jehovah has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation comes. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.

12. And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah. And thou shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.

## Isaiah 63

1. Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, this who is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.

2. Why are thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him who treads in the wine vat?

3. I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no man with me. Yea, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath, and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.

4. For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.

5. And I looked, and there was none to help. And I wondered that there was none to uphold. Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me. And my wrath, it upheld me.

6. And I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.

7. I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Jehovah, and the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.

8. For he said, Surely, they are my people, sons that will not deal falsely. So he was their Savior.

9. In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the agent of his presence saved them. In his love and in his pity he redeemed them. And he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.

10. But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit. Therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them.

11. Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put his holy Spirit in the midst of them,

12. who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name,

13. who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they stumbled not?

14. As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused them to rest. So thou led thy people to make thyself a glorious name.

15. Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory. Where are thy zeal and thy mighty acts? The yearning of thy heart and thy compassions are restrained toward me.

16. For thou are our Father, though Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us, thou, O Jehovah, are our Father, our Redeemer, from everlasting is thy name.

17. O Jehovah, why do thou make us to err from thy ways, and harden our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

18. Thy holy people possessed it but a little while. Our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

19. We have become as those over whom thou never bore rule, as those who were not called by thy name.

## Isaiah 64

1. Oh that thou would rend the heavens, that thou would come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,

2. as when fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!

3. When thou did fearful things which we did not look for, thou came down; the mountains quaked at thy presence.

4. For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, besides thee, what he has prepared for him who waits for him.

5. Thou meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember thee in thy ways. Behold, thou were angry, and we sinned. Therefore we have erred.

6. For we have all become as unclean, and all our righteous acts are as a polluted garment. And we all fade as a leaf. And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.

7. And there is none who calls upon thy name, who stirs himself up to take hold of thee. For thou have hid thy face from us, and have consumed us through our iniquities.

8. But now, O Jehovah, thou are our Father. We are the clay, and thou our potter, and we are all the work of thy hand.

9. Be not angry very severely, O Jehovah, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.

10. Thy holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.

11. Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire, and all our pleasant places are laid waste.

12. Will thou restrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? Will thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very severely?

## Isaiah 65

1. I was manifested by those who did not ask for me. I am found by those who did not seek me. I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.

2. I have spread out my hands all the day to a disobedient and rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, according to their own thoughts,

3. a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks,

4. who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places, who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels,

5. who say, Stand by thyself, do not come near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.

6. Behold, it is written before me. I will not keep silence, but will recompense. Yea, I will recompense into their bosom

7. your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah, those who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.

8. Thus says Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and a man says, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it, so I will do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.

9. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. And my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.

10. And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.

11. But ye who forsake Jehovah, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mingled wine to Destiny,

12. I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter. Because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear, but ye did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.

13. Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry. Behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty. Behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame.

14. Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.

15. And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen, and the lord Jehovah will kill thee. And he will call his servants by another name,

16. so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth, and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth. Because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.

17. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

18. But be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create. For, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

19. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people. And there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.

20. There shall be no more from there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days. For the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.

21. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them. And they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

22. They shall not build, and another inhabit. They shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

23. They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity. For they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.

24. And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

25. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says Jehovah.

## Isaiah 66

1. Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What manner of house will ye build to me, and what place shall be my rest?

2. For all these things my hand has made, and all these things came to be, says Jehovah. But to this man I will look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.

3. He who slaughters an ox is as he who kills a man. He who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck. He who offers an oblation, as swine's blood. He who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.

4. I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them. Because when I called, none answered. When I spoke, they did not hear. But they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.

5. Hear the word of Jehovah, ye who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy. But it is those who shall be put to shame.

6. A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah who renders recompense to his enemies.

7. Before she travailed, she brought forth. Before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.

8. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons.

9. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says Jehovah. Shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb? says thy God.

10. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all ye who mourn over her,

11. that ye may nurse and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations, that ye may get milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.

12. For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream. And ye shall nurse thereof. Ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.

13. As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

14. And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants, and he will have indignation against his enemies.

15. For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind, to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.

16. For by fire Jehovah will execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh, and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.

17. Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, says Jehovah.

18. For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes, that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come, and shall see my glory.

19. And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory, and they shall declare my glory among the nations.

20. And they shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an oblation to Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah, as the sons of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.

21. And of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.

22. For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.

23. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Jehovah.

24. And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me. For their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.
