# Genesis

## Genesis 1

1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

2. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

3. And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.

4. And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness.

5. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.

6. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

7. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so.

8. And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.

9. And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.

10. And God called the dry land Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters Seas. And God saw that it was good.

11. And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind (in which is the seed of them) upon the earth. And it was so.

12. And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit in which is the seed of it, according to their kind. And God saw that it was good.

13. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.

14. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.

15. And let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth. And it was so.

16. And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, also the stars.

17. And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,

18. and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

19. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

20. And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

21. And God created the great sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.

23. And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kind. And it was so.

25. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

26. And God said, Let us make mankind in our image-after our likeness-and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.

27. And God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them.

28. And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.

29. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. To you it shall be for food,

30. and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps upon the earth in which there is life, for food-every green herb. And it was so.

31. And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

## Genesis 2

1. And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

2. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

3. And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.

4. These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.

5. And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up, for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth. And there was not a man to till the ground,

6. but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.

7. And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.

8. And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.

9. And out of the ground Jehovah God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided, and became four heads.

11. The name of the first is Pishon. That is it which encompasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.

12. And the gold of that land is good. There is bdellium and the onyx stone.

13. And the name of the second river is Gihon. The same is it which encompasses the whole land of Cush.

14. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel. That is it which goes in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

15. And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

16. And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat,

17. but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it. For in the day that thou eat of it thou shall surely die.

18. And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make a help meet for him.

19. And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called every living creature, that was the name of it.

20. And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field, but for man there was not found a help meet for him.

21. And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept. And God took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in place of it.

22. And the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, he made a woman, and brought her to the man.

23. And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

24. Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cling to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.

25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

## Genesis 3

1. Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Yea, has God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?

2. And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,

3. but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

4. And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.

5. For God knows that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

6. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate. And she also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.

7. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

8. And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.

9. And Jehovah God called to the man, and said to him, Where are thou?

10. And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. And I hid myself.

11. And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Have thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee that thou should not eat?

12. And the man said, The woman whom thou gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.

13. And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this thou have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.

14. And Jehovah God said to the serpent, Because thou have done this, cursed are thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly thou shall go, and dust thou shall eat all the days of thy life.

15. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. He shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.

16. To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy childbearing, in pain thou shall bring forth children. And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

17. And to Adam he said, Because thou have hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake. In toil thou shall eat of it all the days of thy life.

18. Also, thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to thee, and thou shall eat the herb of the field.

19. In the sweat of thy face thou shall eat bread, till thou return to the ground, for out of it thou were taken. For thou are dust, and to dust thou shall return.

20. And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.

21. And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.

22. And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever-

23. therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from where he was taken.

24. So he drove out the man. And he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life.

## Genesis 4

1. And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from Jehovah.

2. And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

3. And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought an offering to Jehovah of the fruit of the ground.

4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And Jehovah had respect to Abel and to his offering,

5. but he did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.

6. And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are thou angry? And why has thy countenance fallen?

7. If thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? And if thou do not well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire shall be for thee, and thou shall rule over it.

8. And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him.

9. And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?

10. And he said, What have thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cries to me from the ground.

11. And now cursed are thou from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.

12. When thou till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength. A fugitive and a wanderer thou shall be on the earth.

13. And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.

14. Behold, thou have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and I shall be hid from thy face, and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. And it shall come to pass, that whoever finds me shall slay me.

15. And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any who finds him should smite him.

16. And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch. And Cain built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.

18. And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.

19. And Lamech took to him two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

20. And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.

21. And his brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.

22. And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

23. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me.

24. If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy-seven fold.

25. And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For, she said, God has appointed for me another seed instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.

26. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of Jehovah.

## Genesis 5

1. This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God he made him,

2. male and female he created them, and blessed them, and called their name Man, in the day when they were created.

3. And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and called his name Seth.

4. And the days of Adam were eight hundred years after he begot Seth. And he begot sons and daughters.

5. And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.

6. And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enosh.

7. And Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after he begot Enosh, and begot sons and daughters.

8. And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.

9. And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Kenan.

10. And Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he begot Kenan, and begot sons and daughters.

11. And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.

12. And Kenan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel.

13. And Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years after he begot Mahalalel, and begot sons and daughters.

14. And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.

15. And Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.

16. And Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after he begot Jared, and begot sons and daughters.

17. And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.

18. And Jared lived a hundred sixty-two years, and begot Enoch.

19. And Jared lived eight hundred years after he begot Enoch, and begot sons and daughters.

20. And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, and he died.

21. And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah.

22. And Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

23. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.

24. And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.

25. And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.

26. And Methuselah lived seven hundred eighty-two years after he begot Lamech, and begot sons and daughters.

27. And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, and he died.

28. And Lamech lived a hundred eighty-two years, and begot a son.

29. And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed.

30. And Lamech lived five hundred ninety-five years after he begot Noah, and begot sons and daughters.

31. And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, and he died.

32. And Noah was five hundred years old. And Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Genesis 6

1. And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,

2. that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair. And they took to them wives of all that they chose.

3. And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he also is flesh. Yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.

4. The giants were on the earth in those days. And also after that, when the sons of God came to the daughters of men, and they bore sons to them, the same were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.

5. And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

6. And Jehovah regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.

7. And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground, from man, to beast, to creeping things, and birds of the heavens, for I regret that I have made them.

8. But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

9. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God.

10. And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11. And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

12. And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.

13. And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

14. Make thee an ark of gopher wood. Thou shall make rooms in the ark, and shall pitch it inside and outside with pitch.

15. And this is how thou shall make it: The length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

16. Thou shall make a light for the ark, and thou shall finish it to a cubit upward. And thou shall set the door of the ark in the side of it, with lower, second, and third stories thou shall make it.

17. And I, behold, I bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.

18. But I will establish my covenant with thee. And thou shall come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.

19. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort thou shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee. They shall be male and female.

20. Of the birds according to their kind, and of the cattle according to their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind. Two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive.

21. And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee, and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

22. Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.

## Genesis 7

1. And Jehovah said to Noah, Come, thou and all thy house into the ark, for I have seen thee righteous before me in this generation.

2. Of every clean beast thou shall take to thee by sevens, the male and his female. And of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female.

3. Also of the birds of the heavens by sevens, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

4. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will destroy from off the face of the ground.

5. And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him.

6. And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

7. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

8. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps upon the ground,

9. there went in two by two to Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.

10. And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.

11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

12. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13. In the selfsame day Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ark,

14. they, and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle according to their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every sort.

15. And they went in to Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.

16. And those that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in.

17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth. And the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.

18. And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

19. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered,

20. fifteen cubits upward. The waters prevailed, and the mountains were covered.

21. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, from birds, to cattle, to beasts, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, and every man.

22. All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.

23. And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, from man, to cattle, to creeping things, and birds of the heavens, and they were destroyed from the earth. And only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.

24. And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.

## Genesis 8

1. And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.

2. Also the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained.

3. And the waters returned from off the earth continually. And after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.

4. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

5. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.

6. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.

7. And he sent forth a raven. And it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

8. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground.

9. But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot. And she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. And he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in to him into the ark.

10. And he stayed yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.

11. And the dove came in to him at evening. And, lo, in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off, so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.

12. And he stayed yet seven other days, and sent forth the dove. And she did not return again to him any more.

13. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked. And, behold, the face of the ground was dried.

14. And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.

15. And God spoke to Noah, saying,

16. Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.

17. Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds and cattle, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

18. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.

19. Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves upon the earth, according to their families, went forth out of the ark.

20. And Noah built an altar to Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

21. And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor. And Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I again any more smite everything living, as I have done.

22. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

## Genesis 9

1. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth.

2. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens, with all with which the ground teems, and all the fishes of the sea. They are delivered into your hand.

3. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. As the green herb, I have given you all.

4. But flesh with the life of it, which is the blood of it, ye shall not eat.

5. And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, I will require. At the hand of every beast I will require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man.

6. Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. For in the image of God he made man.

7. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply. Bring forth abundantly on the earth, and multiply on it.

8. And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

9. And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you,

10. and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.

11. And I will establish my covenant with you. Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, nor shall there be a flood any more to destroy the earth.

12. And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:

13. I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.

14. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.

15. And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

16. And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

17. And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

18. And the sons of Noah, who went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth. And Ham is the father of Canaan.

19. These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was spread over.

20. And Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.

21. And he drank of the wine, and was drunken. And he was uncovered within his tent.

22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.

23. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.

24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.

25. And he said, Cursed be Canaan. He shall be a servant of servants to his brothers.

26. And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem. And let Canaan be his servant.

27. God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem. And let Canaan be his servant.

28. And Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood.

29. And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.

## Genesis 10

1. Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.

2. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

3. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

4. And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

5. From these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, every man according to his tongue, according to their families, in their nations.

6. And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.

7. And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.

8. And Cush begot Nimrod. He began to be a mighty man on the earth.

9. He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah. Therefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.

10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

11. He went forth out of that land into Assyria, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,

12. and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).

13. And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

14. and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from where the Philistines went forth), and Caphtorim.

15. And Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

16. and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,

17. and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

18. and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad.

19. And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou go toward Gerar, to Gaza, as thou go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, to Lasha.

20. These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.

21. And to Shem, the father of all the sons of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were also born to him.

22. The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

23. And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

24. And Arphaxad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Eber.

25. And to Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days the earth was divided. And his brother's name was Joktan.

26. And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

27. and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

28. and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

29. and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.

30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.

31. These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.

32. These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations. And from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.

## Genesis 11

1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.

2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.

3. And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had slime for mortar.

4. And they said, Come, let us build a city for us, and a tower, and its top in the heavens. And let us make a name for us, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

5. And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men built.

6. And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. And now nothing will be withheld from them, which they propose to do.

7. Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand each other's speech.

8. So Jehovah scattered them abroad from there upon the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.

9. Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because Jehovah there confounded the language of all the earth, and from there Jehovah scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

10. These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood.

11. And Shem lived five hundred years after he begot Arphaxad, and begot sons and daughters.

12. And Arphaxad lived a hundred and thirty-five years, and begot Cainan.

13. And Arphaxad lived after he had begotten Cainan, four hundred years, and begot sons and daughters, and died. And Cainan lived a hundred and thirty years and begot Shelah; and Cainan lived after he had begotten Shelah, three hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters, and died.

14. And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber.

15. And Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he begot Eber, and begot sons and daughters.

16. And Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg.

17. And Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he begot Peleg, and begot sons and daughters.

18. And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu.

19. And Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he begot Reu, and begot sons and daughters.

20. And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug.

21. And Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he begot Serug, and begot sons and daughters.

22. And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.

23. And Serug lived two hundred years after he begot Nahor, and begot sons and daughters.

24. And Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah.

25. And Nahor lived a hundred and nineteen years after he begot Terah, and begot sons and daughters.

26. And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

27. Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begot Lot.

28. And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

29. And Abram and Nahor took wives to themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

30. And Sarai was barren; she had no child.

31. And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife. And they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. And they came to Haran, and dwelt there.

32. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.

## Genesis 12

1. Now Jehovah said to Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land that I will show thee.

2. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and be thou a blessing.

3. And I will bless those who bless thee, and he who curses thee I will curse. And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

4. So Abram went as Jehovah had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.

5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. And they came into the land of Canaan.

6. And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

7. And Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said, I will give this land to thy seed. And there he built an altar to Jehovah, who appeared to him.

8. And he moved from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.

9. And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.

10. And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.

11. And it came to pass, when he came near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou are a fair woman to look upon.

12. And it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife. And they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.

13. Say, I pray thee, thou are my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.

14. And it came to pass, that, when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

15. And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

16. And he dealt well with Abram for her sake. And he had sheep, and oxen, and he-donkeys, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-donkeys, and camels.

17. And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.

18. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou have done to me? Why did thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

19. Why did thou say, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore behold thy wife. Take her, and go thy way.

20. And Pharaoh gave men command concerning him. And they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.

## Genesis 13

1. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.

2. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

3. And he went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,

4. to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. And Abram called on the name of Jehovah there.

5. And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

6. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together. For their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

7. And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite then dwelt in the land.

8. And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen, for we are brothers.

9. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if the right hand, then I will go to the left.

10. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou go to Zoar.

11. So Lot chose for himself all the Plain of the Jordan. And Lot journeyed east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.

12. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan. And Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.

13. Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Jehovah.

14. And Jehovah said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou are, northward and southward and eastward and westward.

15. For all the land which thou see, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed forever.

16. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. So that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.

17. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to thee I will give it.

18. And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Jehovah.

## Genesis 14

1. And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,

2. that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).

3. All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).

4. They served Chedorlaomer twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

5. And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,

6. and the Horites on their mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.

7. And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.

8. And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar), and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim,

9. against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.

10. Now the valley of Siddim was full of slime pits. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there. And those who remained fled to the mountain.

11. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.

12. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

13. And some man came who had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner. And these were allies with Abram.

14. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.

15. And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.

16. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and also the women, and the people.

17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (the same is the King's Valley).

18. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine. And he was priest of God Most High.

19. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth.

20. And blessed be God Most High, who has delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And Abram gave him a tenth of all.

21. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the men, and take the goods to thyself.

22. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,

23. that I will not take a thread nor a shoe latchet nor anything that is thine, lest thou should say, I have made Abram rich,

24. except only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.

## Genesis 15

1. After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram. I am thy shield, thy exceedingly great reward.

2. And Abram said, O lord Jehovah, what will thou give me, since I go childless. And he who shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?

3. And Abram said, Behold, thou have given no seed to me. And, lo, a man born in my house is my heir.

4. And, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir, but he who shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

5. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them. And he said to him, So shall thy seed be.

6. And he believed in Jehovah, and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.

7. And he said to him, I am Jehovah who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

8. And he said, O lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?

9. And he said to him, Take a heifer three years old for me, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon.

10. And he took all these for him, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half opposite the other. But he did not divide the birds.

11. And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.

12. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram. And, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.

13. And he said to Abram, Know of a certainty that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs. And shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years.

14. And also I will judge that nation, whom they shall serve, and afterward they shall come out with great substance.

15. But thou will go to thy fathers in peace; thou will be buried in a good old age.

16. And in the fourth generation they shall come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.

17. And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.

18. In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:

19. the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,

20. and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,

21. and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.

## Genesis 16

1. Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no sons. And she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

2. And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, Jehovah has restrained me from bearing. Go in, I pray thee, to my handmaid. It may be that I will obtain sons by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

3. And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.

4. And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

5. And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be upon thee. I gave my handmaid into they bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Jehovah judge between me and thee.

6. But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand, do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.

7. And the agent of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

8. And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, from where have thou come? And where are thou going? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.

9. And the agent of Jehovah said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

10. And the agent of Jehovah said to her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

11. And the agent of Jehovah said to her, Behold, thou are with child, and shall bear a son, and thou shall call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah has heard thy affliction.

12. And he will be a wild donkey among men, his hand against every man, and every man's hand against him, and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers.

13. And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, Thou are a God who sees, for she said, Have I even here looked behind him who sees me?

14. Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.

15. And Hagar bore Abram a son. And Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

16. And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

## Genesis 17

1. And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am God Almighty, walk before me, and be thou perfect.

2. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.

3. And Abram fell on his face. And God talked with him, saying,

4. As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shall be the father of a multitude of nations.

5. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham, for I have made thee the father of a multitude of nations.

6. And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful. And I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

7. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.

8. And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojourning, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.

9. And God said to Abraham, And as for thee, thou shall keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.

10. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.

11. And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of a covenant between me and you.

12. And he who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations: he who is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.

13. He who is born in thy house, and he who is bought with thy money, must be circumcised. And my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

14. And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.

15. And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shall not call her name Sarai, but her name shall be Sarah.

16. And I will bless her. And moreover I will give thee a son by her. Yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be by her.

17. Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him who is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?

18. And Abraham said to God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!

19. And God said, No, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shall call his name Isaac. And I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.

20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.

21. But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.

22. And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

23. And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said to him.

24. And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

25. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

26. In the selfsame day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

27. And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

## Genesis 18

1. And Jehovah appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.

2. And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,

3. and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.

4. Let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.

5. And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart. After that ye shall pass on, inasmuch as ye came to your servant. And they said, Do so as thou have said.

6. And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.

7. And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it to the servant. And he hastened to dress it.

8. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.

9. And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

10. And he said, I will certainly return to thee when the season comes round, and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.

11. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age. It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

12. And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have become old shall I have pleasure, my lord also being old?

13. And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I who am old certainly bear a child?

14. Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return to thee, when the season comes round, and Sarah shall have a son.

15. Then Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And he said, No, but thou did laugh.

16. And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

17. And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do,

18. since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

19. For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.

20. And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,

21. I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which comes to me. And if not, I will know.

22. And the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham yet stood before Jehovah.

23. And Abraham drew near, and said, Will thou consume righteous men with wicked men?

24. Perhaps there are fifty righteous men within the city. Will thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous men that are in it?

25. That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay a righteous man with a wicked man, that so the righteous man should be as the wicked man. Far be it from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

26. And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous men within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.

27. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.

28. Perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous men. Will thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty-five.

29. And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.

30. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Perhaps there shall be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

31. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord. Perhaps there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.

32. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Perhaps ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.

33. And Jehovah went his way as soon as he had left off conversing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

## Genesis 19

1. And the two agents came to Sodom at evening, and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. And he bowed himself with his face to the earth,

2. and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, No, but we will abide in the street all night.

3. And he urged them greatly. And they turned in to him, and entered into his house. And he made a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

4. But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, encompassed the house around, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.

5. And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.

6. And Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.

7. And he said, I pray you, my brothers, do not so wickedly.

8. Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes. Only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shadow of my roof.

9. And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will be a judge. Now we will deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed greatly upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.

10. But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.

11. And they smote the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

12. And the men said to Lot, Have thou here any besides? Son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomever thou have in the city, bring them out of the place.

13. For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has been great before Jehovah. And Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.

14. And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons-in-law as a man jesting.

15. And when the morning arose, then the agents hurried Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

16. But he lingered. And the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him, and they brought him forth, and set him outside the city.

17. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life, do not look behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain. Escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

18. And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my lord.

19. Behold now, thy servant has found favor in thy sight, and thou have magnified thy loving kindness, which thou have shown to me in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.

20. Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.

21. And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou have spoken.

22. Hasten thee, escape there, for I cannot do anything till thou have come there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

23. The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar.

24. Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven.

25. And he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

26. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

27. And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.

28. And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.

29. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.

30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Zoar. And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

31. And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.

32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed by our father.

33. And they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. And he did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.

34. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed by our father.

35. And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose, and lay with him. And he did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.

36. Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.

37. And the firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab. The same is the father of the Moabites to this day.

38. And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi. The same is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.

## Genesis 20

1. And Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar.

2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

3. But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou are but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou have taken, for she is a man's wife.

4. Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, will thou slay even a righteous nation?

5. Did he not himself say to me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.

6. And God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou have done this. And I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore I did not allow thee to touch her.

7. Now therefore restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shall live. And if thou do not restore her, know thou that thou shall surely die, thou, and all that are thine.

8. And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were exceedingly afraid.

9. Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have thou done to us? And in what have I sinned against thee, that thou have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.

10. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did thou see, that thou have done this thing?

11. And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.

12. And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.

13. And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shall show to me. At every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.

14. And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.

15. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleases thee.

16. And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all who are with thee. And in regard to all thou are righted.

17. And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bore sons.

18. For Jehovah had closed up fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

## Genesis 21

1. And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did to Sarah as he had spoken.

2. And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.

3. And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.

4. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.

5. And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.

6. And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.

7. And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should give sons suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age.

8. And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.

9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.

10. Therefore she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.

11. And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.

12. And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah says to thee, hearken to her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

13. And also I will make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is thy seed.

14. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

15. And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

16. And she went, and sat herself down opposite him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.

17. And God heard the voice of the lad. And the agent of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What troubles thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.

18. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand, for I will make him a great nation.

19. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

20. And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.

21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

22. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou do.

23. Now therefore swear to me here by God that thou will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shall do to me, and to the land in which thou have sojourned.

24. And Abraham said, I will swear.

25. And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken away violently.

26. And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing, neither did thou tell me, nor yet did I hear of it, but today.

27. And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. And the two made a covenant.

28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

29. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What do these seven ewe lambs mean which thou have set by themselves?

30. And he said, These seven ewe lambs thou shall take from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.

31. Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there they swore both of them.

32. So they made a covenant at Beersheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

33. And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there called on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.

34. And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.

## Genesis 22

1. And it came to pass after these things, that God proved Abraham, and said to him, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.

2. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou love, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

3. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.

4. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.

5. And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go yonder, and we will worship, and come again to you.

6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.

7. And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

8. And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they went both of them together.

9. And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.

10. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.

11. And the agent of Jehovah called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.

12. And he said, Do not lay thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything to him. For now I know that thou fear God, since thou have not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.

13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.

14. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.

15. And the agent of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,

16. and said, By myself I have sworn, says Jehovah, because thou have done this thing, and have not withheld thy son, thine only son,

17. that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies,

18. and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou have obeyed my voice.

19. So Abraham returned to his young men. And they rose up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

20. And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor:

21. Uz his first born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,

22. and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

23. And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

24. And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.

## Genesis 23

1. And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.

2. And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

3. And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,

4. I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

5. And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,

6. Hear us, my lord. Thou are a prince of God among us. Bury thy dead in our choice sepulchers. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou may bury thy dead.

7. And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the sons of Heth.

8. And he conversed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

9. that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. Let him give it to me for the full price in the midst of you for a possession of a burying place.

10. Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the sons of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,

11. No, my lord, hear me. I give thee the field. And the cave that is in it, I give it to thee. I give it to thee in the presence of the sons of my people. Bury thy dead.

12. And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.

13. And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou will, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.

14. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,

15. My lord, hearken to me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee? Therefore bury thy dead.

16. And Abraham hearkened to Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver that he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

17. So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border of it round about, were made sure

18. to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.

19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.

20. And the field, and the cave that is in it, were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the sons of Heth.

## Genesis 24

1. And Abraham was old, well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.

2. And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put thy hand, I pray thee, under my thigh.

3. And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.

4. But thou shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.

5. And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I bring thy son again to the land from where thou came?

6. And Abraham said to him, Beware thou that thou not bring my son there again.

7. Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land, he will send his agent before thee, and thou shall take a wife for my son from there.

8. And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shall be clear from this my oath. Only thou shall not bring my son there again.

9. And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.

10. And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.

11. And he made the camels to kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.

12. And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

13. Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.

14. And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou have appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby I shall know that thou have shown kindness to my master.

15. And it came to pass, before he was done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

16. And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.

17. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.

18. And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

19. And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

20. And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.

21. And the man looked steadfastly on her, keeping silent, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.

22. And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,

23. and said, Whose daughter are thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

24. And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.

25. She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.

26. And the man bowed his head, and worshiped Jehovah.

27. And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Jehovah has led me in the way to the house of my master's brothers.

28. And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.

29. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. And Laban ran out to the man, to the fountain.

30. And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me, that he came to the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.

31. And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Why do thou stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

32. And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

33. And there was set before him food to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.

34. And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

35. And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great. And he has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and donkeys.

36. And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old. And has he given to him all that he has.

37. And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,

38. but thou shall go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.

39. And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.

40. And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his agent with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.

41. Then thou shall be clear from my oath, when thou come to my kindred. And if they do not give her to thee, thou shall be clear from my oath.

42. And I came this day to the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if thou do now prosper my way which I go,

43. behold, I am standing by the fountain of water, and let it come to pass, that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink,

44. and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, let the same be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my master's son.

45. And before I was done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down to the fountain, and drew. And I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.

46. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.

48. And I bowed my head, and worshiped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.

49. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from Jehovah; we cannot speak to thee bad or good.

51. Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as Jehovah has spoken.

52. And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Jehovah.

53. And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.

54. And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.

55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.

56. And he said to them, Do not hinder me, since Jehovah has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.

57. And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.

58. And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.

59. And they sent Rebekah their sister away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.

60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.

61. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

62. And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi, for he dwelt in the land of the South.

63. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.

64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.

65. And she said to the servant, What man is this who walks in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.

66. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.

67. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

## Genesis 25

1. And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.

2. And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

3. And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

4. And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.

5. And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.

6. But to the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.

7. And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred seventy-five years.

8. And Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.

9. And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,

10. the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.

11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.

12. Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.

13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

14. and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

15. Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

16. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their nations.

17. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years. And he gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.

18. And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur which is before Egypt, as thou go toward Assyria. He abode opposite all his brothers.

19. And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac.

20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.

21. And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

22. And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, why do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.

23. And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the elder shall serve the younger.

24. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.

25. And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau.

26. And after that his brother came forth, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel, and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

27. And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.

28. Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.

29. And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.

30. And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.

31. And Jacob said, First sell me thy birthright.

32. And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die, and what profit shall the birthright do to me?

33. And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he swore to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob.

34. And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.

## Genesis 26

1. And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.

2. And Jehovah appeared to him, and said, Do not go down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.

3. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For to thee, and to thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham thy father.

4. And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these lands, and in thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,

5. because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my order, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

6. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.

7. And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife, Lest, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she was fair to look upon.

8. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was playing with Rebekah his wife.

9. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, she is certainly thy wife, and how did thou say, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.

10. And Abimelech said, What is this thou have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou would have brought guiltiness upon us.

11. And Abimelech ordered all the people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

12. And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him.

13. And the man became great, and grew more and more until he became very great.

14. And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.

15. Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with soil.

16. And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us, for thou are much mightier than we.

17. And Isaac departed from there, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.

18. And Isaac again dug the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.

19. And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.

20. And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.

21. And they dug another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.

22. And he moved from there, and dug another well, and they did not strive for that. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.

23. And he went up from there to Beersheba.

24. And Jehovah appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

25. And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.

26. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.

27. And Isaac said to them, Why have ye come to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?

28. And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and thee. And let us make a covenant with thee,

29. that thou will do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou are now the blessed of Jehovah.

30. And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.

31. And they rose up promptly in the morning, and swore one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

32. And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.

33. And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.

34. And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.

35. And they were a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.

## Genesis 27

1. And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, My son. And he said to him, Here I am.

2. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.

3. Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take venison for me.

4. And make savory food for me, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, that my soul may bless thee before I die.

5. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

6. And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,

7. Bring venison for me, and make savory food for me, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.

8. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.

9. Go now to the flock, and fetch me two good kids of the goats from there. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loves.

10. And thou shall bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.

11. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.

12. My father will perhaps feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

13. And his mother said to him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch them for me.

14. And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.

15. And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.

16. And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.

17. And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

18. And he came to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are thou, my son?

19. And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy firstborn. I have done according as thou bade me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

20. And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.

21. And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

22. And Jacob went near to Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

23. And he did not discern him, because his hands were hairy as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.

24. And he said, Are thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

25. And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate. And he brought wine to him, and he drank.

26. And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.

27. And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that Jehovah has blessed.

28. And God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.

29. Let peoples serve thee, and nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brothers, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be he who curses thee, and blessed be he who blesses thee.

30. And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

31. And he also made savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

32. And Isaac his father said to him, Who are thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.

33. And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou came, and have blessed him? Yea, he shall be blessed.

34. When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.

35. And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and has taken away thy blessing.

36. And he said, Is not he rightly name Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have thou not reserved a blessing for me?

37. And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?

38. And Esau said to his father, Have thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.

39. And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above.

40. And by thy sword thou shall live, and thou shall serve thy brother. And it shall come to pass, when thou shall break loose, that thou shall shake his yoke from off thy neck.

41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.

42. And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau comforts himself concerning thee, to kill thee.

43. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran.

44. And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turns away,

45. until thy brother's anger turns away from thee, and he forgets that which thou have done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?

46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

## Genesis 28

1. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and ordered him, and said to him, Thou shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

2. Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from there of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.

3. And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou may be a company of peoples,

4. and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee, that thou may inherit the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraham.

5. And Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

6. Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take for him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him an order, saying, Thou shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,

7. and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram.

8. And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father.

9. And Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.

10. And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

11. And he touched upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.

12. And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And, behold, the agents of God ascending and descending on it.

13. And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which thou lie, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed.

14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

15. And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee wherever thou go, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.

16. And Jacob awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it.

17. And he was afraid, and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.

19. And he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at first.

20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,

21. so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,

22. then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth to thee.

## Genesis 29

1. Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east.

2. And he looked, and, behold, a well in the field. And, lo, three flocks of sheep were lying there by it, for they watered the flocks out of that well. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great.

3. And all the flocks were gathered there. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.

4. And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where are ye from? And they said, We are of Haran.

5. And he said to them, Do ye know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.

6. And he said to them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.

7. And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.

8. And they said, We cannot until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.

9. While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.

10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

12. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.

13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

14. And Laban said to him, Surely thou are my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.

15. And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou are my brother, should thou therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?

16. And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

17. And Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.

18. And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

19. And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.

20. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.

21. And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.

22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in to her.

24. And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.

25. And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou have done to me? Did I not serve with thee for Rachel? Why then have thou beguiled me?

26. And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.

27. Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shall serve with me yet seven other years.

28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.

29. And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.

30. And he also went in to Rachel, and also he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

31. And Jehovah saw that Leah was regarded inferior, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.

32. And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah has looked upon my affliction, for now my husband will love me.

33. And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am regarded inferior, he has therefore given me this son also. And she called his name Simeon.

34. And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.

35. And she conceived again, and bore a son. And she said, This time I will praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing.

## Genesis 30

1. And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no sons, Rachel envied her sister, and she said to Jacob, Give me sons, or else I die.

2. And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

3. And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain sons by her.

4. And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife, and Jacob went in to her.

5. And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.

6. And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son. Therefore she called his name Dan.

7. And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.

8. And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed. And she called his name Naphtali.

9. When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife.

10. And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bore Jacob a son.

11. And Leah said, Fortunate! And she called his name Gad.

12. And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bore Jacob a second son.

13. And Leah said, Happy am I! For the daughters will call me happy. And she called his name Asher.

14. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

15. And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou have taken away my husband? And would thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee tonight for thy son's mandrakes.

16. And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me, for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

17. And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.

18. And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar.

19. And Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.

20. And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. And she called his name Zebulun.

21. And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

22. And God remembered Rachel. And God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.

23. And she conceived, and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach.

24. And she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah adds another son to me.

25. And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.

26. Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go, for thou know my service with which I have served thee.

27. And Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry, for I have learned by experience that Jehovah has blessed me for thy sake.

28. And he said, Appoint for me thy wages, and I will give it.

29. And he said to him, Thou know how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.

30. For it was little which thou had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude, and Jehovah has blessed thee wherever I turned. And now when shall I provide for my own house also?

31. And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shall not give me anything. If thou will do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.

32. I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and of such shall be my hire.

33. So shall my righteousness answer for me after this, when thou shall come concerning my hire that is before thee. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that is with me, shall be considered stolen.

34. And Laban said, Behold, O that it might be according to thy word.

35. And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

36. And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

37. And Jacob took for him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree, and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white which was in the rods appear.

38. And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. And they conceived when they came to drink.

39. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.

40. And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban. And he put his own herds apart, and did not put them near Laban's flock.

41. And it came to pass, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods,

42. but when the flock were weak, he did not put them in. So the weaker were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

43. And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and donkeys.

## Genesis 31

1. And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and he has gotten all this glory of that which was our father's.

2. And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.

3. And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.

4. And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,

5. and said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime, but the God of my father has been with me.

6. And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

7. And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me.

8. If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages, then all the flock bore speckled, and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages, then all the flock bore ringstreaked.

9. Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.

10. And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.

11. And the agent of God said to me in the dream, Jacob. And I said, Here I am.

12. And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to thee.

13. I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointed a pillar, where thou vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return to the land of thy nativity.

14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

15. Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.

16. For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to thee, do.

17. Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels.

18. And he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father to the land of Canaan.

19. Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.

20. And Jacob slipped away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he fled.

21. So he fled with all that he had. And he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.

22. And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.

23. And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.

24. And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, Take heed to thyself that thou not speak to Jacob either good or bad.

25. And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain. And Laban encamped with his brothers in the mountain of Gilead.

26. And Laban said to Jacob, What have thou done, that thou have slipped away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?

27. Why did thou flee secretly, and creep away from me, and did not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp,

28. and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now thou have done foolishly.

29. It is in the power of my hand to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou not speak to Jacob either good or bad.

30. And now, though thou have certainly gone, because thou have been very desirous for thy father's house, yet why have thou stolen my gods?

31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest thou should take thy daughters from me by force.

32. With whomever thou find thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brothers discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.

33. And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

34. Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt around all the tent, but did not find them.

35. And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but did not find the teraphim.

36. And Jacob was angry, and chided with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin that thou have hotly pursued after me?

37. Whereas thou have felt around all my stuff, what have thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and thy brothers, that they may judge between us two.

38. These twenty years I have been with thee, thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and I have not eaten the rams of thy flocks.

39. I did not bring to thee that which was torn by beasts; I bore the loss of it, of my hand thou required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.

40. Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.

41. These twenty years I have been in thy house. I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock. And thou have changed my wages ten times.

42. Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now thou would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee last night.

43. And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou see is mine. And what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their sons whom they have borne?

44. And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

45. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

46. And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones, and they took stones, and made a heap. And they ate there by the heap.

47. And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.

48. And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore the name of it was called Galeed,

49. and Mizpah. For he said, May Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another,

50. if thou will afflict my daughters, and if thou will take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us, see, God is witness between me and thee.

51. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set between me and thee.

52. This heap is witness, and the pillar is witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.

53. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.

54. And Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread. And they ate bread, and tarried all night on the mountain.

55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.

## Genesis 32

1. And Jacob went on his way, and the agents of God met him.

2. And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's camp. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

3. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.

4. And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord Esau, Thus says thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.

5. And I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants. And I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.

6. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he comes to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies.

8. And he said, If Esau comes to the one company, and smites it, then the company which is left shall escape.

9. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,

10. I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou have shown to thy servant, for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two companies.

11. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau. For I fear him, lest he comes and smites me, the mother with the sons.

12. And thou said, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

13. And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:

14. two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

15. thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.

16. And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.

17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose are thou? And where do thou go? And whose are these before thee?

18. Then thou shall say, Thy servant Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord Esau. And, behold, he also is behind us.

19. And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all who followed the herds, saying, On this manner shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him,

20. and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.

21. So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the company.

22. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.

23. And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.

24. And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.

25. And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained as he wrestled with him.

26. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let thee go unless thou bless me.

27. And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

28. And he said, Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for thou have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.

29. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Why is it that thou ask for my name? And he blessed him there.

30. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.

31. And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.

32. Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.

## Genesis 33

1. And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.

2. And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindmost.

3. And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

4. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.

5. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given thy servant.

6. Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.

7. And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. And afterward Joseph came near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

8. And he said, What do thou mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.

9. And Esau said, I have enough, my brother, let that which thou have be thine.

10. And Jacob said, No, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand, inasmuch as I have seen thy face, as any man would see the face of God, and thou were pleased with me.

11. Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

12. And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.

13. And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.

14. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.

15. And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folks that are with me. And he said, What need is it? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.

16. So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.

17. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for him a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

18. And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and encamped before the city.

19. And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred lambs.

20. And he erected an altar there, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.

## Genesis 34

1. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.

2. And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.

3. And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.

4. And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.

5. Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. And his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob held his peace until they came.

6. And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to converse with him.

7. And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. And the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter, which thing ought not to be done.

8. And Hamor conversed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. I pray you, give her to him to wife.

9. And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.

10. And ye shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade ye in it, and get possessions for you in it.

11. And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me I will give.

12. Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me, but give me the damsel to wife.

13. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,

14. and said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a reproach to us.

15. Only on this condition will we consent to you: If ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised.

16. Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us. And we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.

17. But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

18. And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

19. And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was honored above all the house of his father.

20. And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and conversed with the men of their city, saying,

21. These men are peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade in it, for, behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.

22. Only on this condition will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.

23. Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.

24. And all who went out of the gate of his city hearkened to Hamor and to Shechem his son, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

25. And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males.

26. And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth.

27. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.

28. They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

29. and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, they took captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.

30. And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. And, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

31. And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?

## Genesis 35

1. And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to thee when thou fled from the face of Esau thy brother.

2. Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments.

3. And let us arise, and go up to Bethel, and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.

4. And they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears. And Jacob hid them under the oak that was by Shechem.

5. And they journeyed, and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

6. So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Bethel), he and all the people that were with him.

7. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-bethel, because God was revealed to him there, when he fled from the face of his brother.

8. And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak. And the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.

9. And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.

10. And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob. Thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called his name Israel.

11. And God said to him, I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.

12. And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to thee, and I will give the land to thy seed after thee.

13. And God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.

14. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. And he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.

15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.

16. And they journeyed from Bethel. And there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.

17. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not, for now thou shall have another son.

18. And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin.

19. And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).

20. And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave, the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.

21. And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.

22. And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.

23. The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.

24. The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.

25. And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali.

26. And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.

27. And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

28. And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.

29. And Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.

## Genesis 36

1. Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).

2. Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,

3. and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.

4. And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz, and Basemath bore Reuel,

5. and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.

6. And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.

7. For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their sojourning could not bear them because of their cattle.

8. And Esau dwelt in mount Seir. Esau is Edom.

9. And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:

10. These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.

11. And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

12. And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son, and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.

13. And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah, These were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.

14. And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.

15. These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,

16. chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs that came by Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah.

17. And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs that came by Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.

18. And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs that came by Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

19. These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs. The same is Edom.

20. These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,

21. and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.

22. And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. And Lotan's sister was Timna.

23. And these are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.

24. And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father.

25. And these are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.

26. And these are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.

27. These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.

28. These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.

29. These are the chiefs that came from the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,

30. chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs that came from the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.

31. And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the sons of Israel.

32. And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.

33. And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.

34. And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.

35. And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead. And the name of his city was Avith.

36. And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

37. And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.

38. And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.

39. And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead. And the name of his city was Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.

40. And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timnah, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,

41. chief Aholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,

42. chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,

43. chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.

## Genesis 37

1. And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojourning, in the land of Canaan.

2. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and Joseph brought the evil report of them to their father.

3. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made for him a coat of many colors.

4. And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers. And they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.

5. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him yet the more.

6. And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.

7. For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright. And, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

8. And his brothers said to him, Shall thou indeed reign over us? Or shall thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

9. And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers. And said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream again. And, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.

10. And he told it to his father, and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that thou have dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

11. And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the saying in mind.

12. And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

13. And Israel said to Joseph, Are not thy brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here I am.

14. And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brothers, and well with the flock, and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15. And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What do thou seek?

16. And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding.

17. And the man said, They are departed from here, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.

18. And they saw him afar off. And before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.

19. And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.

20. Come now therefore, and let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits. And we will say, An evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams.

21. And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.

22. And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood. Cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him, that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.

23. And it came to pass, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him,

24. and they took him, and cast him into the pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.

25. And they sat down to eat bread. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.

26. And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?

27. Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers hearkened to him.

28. And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen, and they drew and lifted Joseph up out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.

29. And Reuben returned to the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he tore his clothes,

30. and he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not, and I, where shall I go?

31. And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.

32. And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, We have found this. Know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.

33. And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat. An evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.

34. And Jacob tore his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

35. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.

36. And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.

## Genesis 38

1. And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

2. And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in to her.

3. And she conceived, and bore a son, and he called his name Er.

4. And she conceived again, and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.

5. And she yet again bore a son, and called his name Shelah. And he was at Chezib, when she bore him.

6. And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.

7. And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah killed him.

8. And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

9. And Onan knew that the seed would not be his. And it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.

10. And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and he killed him also.

11. Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up, for he said, Lest he also die, like his brothers. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

12. And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. And Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

13. And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goes up to Timnah to shear his sheep.

14. And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given to him to wife.

15. When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face.

16. And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in to thee, for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will thou give me, that thou may come in to me?

17. And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Will thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

18. And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.

19. And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

20. And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her.

21. Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, who was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.

22. And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her, and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.

23. And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and thou have not found her.

24. And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has played the harlot, and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

25. When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, I am with child. And she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose these are, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.

26. And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

27. And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.

28. And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand. And the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

29. And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out. And she said, Why have thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez.

30. And afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread upon his hand. And his name was called Zerah.

## Genesis 39

1. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there.

2. And Jehovah was with Joseph. And he was a man who succeeds. And he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

3. And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

4. And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered to him. And he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

5. And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.

6. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he knew nothing that was with him, save the bread which he ate. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.

7. And it came to pass, after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.

8. But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.

9. He is not greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

10. And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not hearken to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

11. And it came to pass, about this time, that he went into the house to do his work, and there was none of the men of the house there inside.

12. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. And he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got out.

13. And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,

14. that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.

15. And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got out.

16. And she laid up his garment by her until his master came home.

17. And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou have brought to us, came in to me to mock me.

18. And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.

19. And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me, that his wrath was kindled.

20. And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound. And he was there in the prison.

21. But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

22. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. And whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.

23. The keeper of the prison did not look to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him, and that which he did, Jehovah made it prosper.

## Genesis 40

1. And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt, and his baker, offended their lord the king of Egypt.

2. And Pharaoh was angry against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

3. And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

4. And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered to them. And they continued a season in ward.

5. And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.

6. And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.

7. And he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Why do ye look so sad today?

8. And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no man who can interpret it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, I pray you.

9. And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me.

10. And in the vine were three branches. And it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters of it brought forth ripe grapes.

11. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

12. And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days.

13. Within yet three days Pharaoh shall lift up thy head, and restore thee to thine office. And thou shall give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou was his butler.

14. But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.

15. For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

16. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.

17. And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.

18. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days.

19. Within yet three days Pharaoh shall lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

20. And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.

21. And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand,

22. but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.

23. Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

## Genesis 41

1. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed. And, behold, he stood by the river.

2. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, well-favored and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed grass.

3. And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.

4. And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.

5. And he slept and dreamed a second time. And, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, fat and good.

6. And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.

7. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

8. And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men of it. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was no man who could interpret them to Pharaoh.

9. Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day.

10. Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.

11. And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he, we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

12. And there was a young man with us there, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him. And he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream.

13. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; he restored me to my office, and he hanged him.

14. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph. And they brought him hastily out of the dungeon, and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.

15. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no man who can interpret it. And I have heard say of thee, that when thou hear a dream thou can interpret it.

16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

17. And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river.

18. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed and well-favored, and they fed in the reed grass.

19. And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.

20. And the lean and ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows.

21. And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

22. And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good.

23. And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them,

24. and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no man who could declare it to me.

25. And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.

26. The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.

27. And the seven lean and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind, they shall be seven years of famine.

28. That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.

29. Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,

30. and there shall arise after them seven years of famine. And all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.

31. And the plenty shall not be known in the land because of that famine which follows, for it shall be very grievous.

32. And because the dream was doubled to Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

33. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out for a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

34. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years.

35. And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.

36. And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land not perish through the famine.

37. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

38. And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?

39. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Inasmuch as God has shown thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou.

40. Thou shall be over my house, and according to thy word all my people shall be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than thou.

41. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

42. And Pharaoh took his signet ring from off his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.

43. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had, and they cried before him, Bow the knee. And he set him over all the land of Egypt.

44. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.

45. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, for a wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

46. And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

47. And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.

48. And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. The food of the field, which was round about every city, he laid up in the same.

49. And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering, for it was without number.

50. And two sons were born to Joseph before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.

51. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

52. And the name of the second he called Ephraim, for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.

53. And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.

54. And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

55. And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.

56. And the famine was over all the face of the earth. And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.

57. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe on all the earth.

## Genesis 42

1. Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt. And Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

2. And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Get you down there, and buy for us from there, that we may live, and not die.

3. And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.

4. But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob did not send with his brothers, for he said, Lest perhaps harm befall him.

5. And the sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

6. And Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.

7. And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself foreign to them, and spoke roughly with them. And he said to them. From where come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

8. And Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.

9. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them. And said to them, Ye are spies; ye have come to see the nakedness of the land.

10. And they said to him, No, my lord, but thy servants have come to buy food.

11. We are all one man's sons. We are true men. Thy servants are no spies.

12. And he said to them, No, but ye have come to see the nakedness of the land.

13. And they said, We thy servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. And, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.

14. And Joseph said to them, This is that which I spoke to you, saying, Ye are spies.

15. By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth from here unless your youngest brother comes here.

16. Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother. And ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

17. And he put them all together into ward three days.

18. And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live, for I fear God:

19. If ye be true men, let one of your brothers be bound in your prison house, but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses,

20. and bring your youngest brother to me. So shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

21. And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear. Therefore this distress has come upon us.

22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Sin not against the child, and ye would not hear? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.

23. And they did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.

24. And he turned himself around from them, and wept. And he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.

25. Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way. And thus it was done to them.

26. And they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.

27. And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey provender in the lodging place, he saw his money, and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.

28. And he said to his brothers, My money is restored, and, lo, it is even in my sack. And their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?

29. And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,

30. The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.

31. And we said to him, We are true men, and we are no spies.

32. We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

33. And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this I shall know that ye are true men. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way,

34. and bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and ye shall trade in the land.

35. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.

36. And Jacob their father said to them, Ye have bereaved me of my sons. Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.

37. And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him to thee. Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

38. And he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm befalls him by the way in which ye go, then ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.

## Genesis 43

1. And the famine was severe in the land.

2. And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.

3. And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly protested to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face unless your brother be with you.

4. If thou will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for thee,

5. but if thou will not send him, we will not go down. For the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face unless your brother be with you.

6. And Israel said, Why did ye deal so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?

7. And they said, The man asked diligently concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? Have ye another brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we in any way know that he would say, Bring your brother down?

8. And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the young man with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.

9. I will be surety for him, of my hand shall thou require him. If I do not bring him to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame forever.

10. For unless we had lingered, surely we would have now returned a second time.

11. And their father Israel said to them, If it be so now, do this: Take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.

12. And take double money in your hand, and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand. Perhaps it was an oversight.

13. Also take your brother, and arise, go again to the man.

14. And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my sons, I am bereaved.

15. And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin, and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

16. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and kill, and make ready, for the men shall dine with me at noon.

17. And the man did as Joseph bade, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.

18. And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our donkeys.

19. And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,

20. and said, Oh, my lord, we indeed came down at the first time to buy food.

21. And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. And we have brought it again in our hand.

22. And we have brought other money down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our sacks.

23. And he said, Peace be to you, fear not. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.

24. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their donkeys provender.

25. And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.

26. And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.

27. And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?

28. And they said, Thy servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.

29. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.

30. And Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned over his brother, and he sought where to weep. And he entered into his chamber, and wept there.

31. And he washed his face, and came out. And he restrained himself, and said, Set on bread.

32. And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, who ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.

33. And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. And the men marveled one with another.

34. And he took and sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

## Genesis 44

1. And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.

2. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

3. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.

4. And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men, and when thou overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?

5. Is not this that in which my lord drinks, and how he indeed divines? Ye have done evil in so doing.

6. And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.

7. And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.

8. Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee out of the land of Canaan. How then would we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

9. With whomever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

10. And he said, Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it is found shall be my bondman, and ye shall be blameless.

11. Then they hurried, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.

12. And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

13. Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.

14. And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house. And he was yet there, and they fell before him on the ground.

15. And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?

16. And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak, or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.

17. And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman, but as for you, get you up in peace to your father.

18. Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant, for thou are even as Pharaoh.

19. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

20. And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. And his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.

21. And thou said to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.

22. And we said to my lord, The young man cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.

23. And thou said to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

24. And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.

25. And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.

26. And we said, We cannot go down. If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down, for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother be with us.

27. And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons.

28. And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since.

29. And if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.

30. Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the young man is not with us, since his life is bound up in the young man's life,

31. it will come to pass, when he sees that the young man is not with us, that he will die. And thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.

32. For thy servant became surety for the young man to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.

33. Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide a bondman to my lord instead of the young man, and let the young man go up with his brothers.

34. For how shall I go up to my father, if the young man be not with me? Lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.

## Genesis 45

1. Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried out, Cause every man to go out from me. And no man stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.

2. And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.

3. And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph, does my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence.

4. And Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near, and he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

5. And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.

6. For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.

7. And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.

8. So now it was not you that sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.

9. Hasten ye, and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says thy son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me, delay not.

10. And thou shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shall be near to me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou have.

11. And there will I nourish thee, for there are yet five years of famine, lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou have.

12. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.

13. And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen. And ye shall hasten and bring down my father here.

14. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.

15. And he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them. And after that his brothers talked with him.

16. And the report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come. And it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.

17. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brothers, This do ye: Load your beasts, and go, get you to the land of Canaan,

18. and take your father and your households, and come to me. And I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.

19. Now thou are commanded, this do ye: Take wagons for you out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.

20. Also do not regard your stuff, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.

21. And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

22. He gave to all of them, each man, changes of raiment, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

23. And he sent to his father according to this manner: ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-donkeys laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.

24. So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. And he said to them, See that ye not fall out by the way.

25. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.

26. And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them.

27. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. And when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.

28. And Israel said, It is enough, Joseph my son is yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.

## Genesis 46

1. And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.

2. And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here I am.

3. And he said, I am God, the God of thy father. Fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation.

4. I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again, and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

5. And Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

6. And they took up their goods, and all their property, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, they came into the land of Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:

7. the sons, and the sons of his sons with him, his daughters, and the daughters of his daughters. And he brought all his seed into Egypt.

8. And these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

9. And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

10. And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.

11. And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

12. And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah. But Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.

13. And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.

14. And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

15. These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.

16. And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

17. And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.

18. These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.

19. The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.

20. And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bore to him.

21. And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

22. These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.

23. And the sons of Dan: Hushim.

24. And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

25. These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob. All the souls were seven.

26. All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty-six.

27. And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy.

28. And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.

29. And Joseph made his chariot ready, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen. And he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

30. And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou are yet alive.

31. And Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.

32. And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.

33. And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?

34. that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers, that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.

## Genesis 47

1. Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan. And, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

2. And he took five men from among his brothers, and presented them to Pharaoh.

3. And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.

4. And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

5. And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brothers have come to thee.

6. The land of Egypt is before thee. Make thy father and thy brothers to dwell in the best of the land; in the land of Goshen let them dwell. And if thou know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

7. And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

8. And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?

9. And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.

11. And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

12. And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.

13. And there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

14. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

15. And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence? For our money fails.

16. And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if money fails.

17. And they brought their cattle to Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys. And he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.

18. And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent, and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.

19. Why should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land not be desolate.

20. So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. For the Egyptians, every man, sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. And the land became Pharaoh's.

21. And as for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.

22. Only he did not buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land.

23. Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.

24. And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.

25. And they said, Thou have saved our lives. Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

26. And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.

27. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they got possessions in it, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

28. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty-seven years.

29. And the time drew near that Israel must die. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put thy hand, I pray thee, under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt,

30. but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place. And he said, I will do as thou have said.

31. And he said, Swear to me, and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed.

## Genesis 48

1. And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick. And he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

2. And it was reported to Jacob, saying, Behold, thy son Joseph comes to thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

3. And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

4. and said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

5. And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine, Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.

6. And thy issue, which thou beget after them, shall be thine, they shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.

7. And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath. And I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).

8. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

9. And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them.

10. Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.

11. And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face, and, lo, God has let me see thy seed also.

12. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.

14. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands deliberately, for Manasseh was the firstborn.

15. And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,

16. the agent who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

17. And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. And he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.

18. And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.

19. And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

20. And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

21. And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.

22. Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

## Genesis 49

1. And Jacob called to his sons, and said, gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.

2. Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and hearken to Israel your father.

3. Reuben, thou are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.

4. Boiling over as water, thou shall not have the pre-eminence, because thou went up to thy father's bed, then thou defiled it; he went up to my couch.

5. Simeon and Levi are brothers, weapons of violence are their swords.

6. O my soul, come not thou into their council, to their assembly, my glory, be not thou united, for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they hocked an ox.

7. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

8. Judah, thy brothers shall praise thee. Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies. Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee.

9. Judah is a lion's whelp. From the prey, my son, thou have gone up. He stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him up?

10. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs, and to him shall the obedience of the peoples be.

11. Binding his foal to the vine, and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he has washed his garments in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes.

12. His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

13. Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea, and he shall be for a haven of ships. And his border shall be upon Sidon.

14. Issachar is a strong donkey, couching down between the sheepfolds.

15. And he saw a resting place that it was good, and the land that it was pleasant. And he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant under task work.

16. Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

17. Dan shall be a serpent in the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse's heels, so that his rider falls backward.

18. I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.

19. Gad, a troop shall press upon him, but he shall press upon their heel.

20. Out of the Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.

21. Naphtali is a hind let loose. He gives goodly words.

22. Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a fountain, his branches run over the wall.

23. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and persecute him,

24. but his bow abode in strength. And the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),

25. even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that couches beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.

26. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my forefathers to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. They shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.

27. Benjamin is a wolf that ravens. In the morning he shall devour the prey, and at evening he shall divide the spoil.

28. All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is it that their father spoke to them and blessed them; every man according to his blessing he blessed them.

29. And he ordered them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

30. in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying place.

31. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah,

32. the field and the cave that is in it, which was purchased from the sons of Heth.

33. And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 50

1. And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.

2. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.

3. And forty days were fulfilled for him, for so are fulfilled the days of embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.

4. And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

5. My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die. In my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shall thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.

6. And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.

7. And Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

8. and all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father's house. Only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

9. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. And it was a very great company.

10. And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan. And there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation. And he made a mourning for his father seven days.

11. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.

12. And his sons did to him according as he commanded them.

13. For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

14. And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

15. And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did to him.

16. And they sent a message to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,

17. So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brothers, and their sin, because they did to thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.

18. And his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.

19. And Joseph said to them, Fear not, for am I in the place of God?

20. And as for you, ye meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

21. Now therefore fear ye not. I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.

22. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house. And Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.

23. And Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of the third generation. Also the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.

24. And Joseph said to his brothers, I die, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

25. And Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from here.

26. So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
