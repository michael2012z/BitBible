# 2 Peter

## 2 Peter 1

1. Simon Peter, a bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:

2. Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,

3. as all things of his divine power to us, things toward life and piety, which were granted through the knowledge of him who called us through glory and virtue.

4. Because of which, the precious and greatest promises have been given to us, so that through these ye might become companions of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in lust.

5. Now this same thing also, having applied all eagerness, furnish in your faith, virtue, and in virtue, knowledge,

6. and in knowledge, self-control, and in self-control, perseverance, and in perseverance, piety,

7. and in piety, brotherly affection, and in brotherly affection, love.

8. For these things existing in you and abounding, it leads to not being idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. For he in whom these things are not present is blind, being near-sighted, having deliberately forgotten the purification of his former sins.

10. Therefore, brothers, instead be diligent to make your calling and selection sure, for doing these things, ye would, no, not ever stumble.

11. For so the entrance will be furnished to you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

12. Therefore I will not neglect to always remind you about these things, although having known them, and having been established in the present truth.

13. But I think it right, inasmuch as I am in this tent, to arouse you in memory.

14. Knowing that the putting off of my tent is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ indicated to me.

15. And also I will endeavor for you to always have, after my departure, the memory of these things to apply.

16. For we revealed to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, not men who followed in cunningly devised myths, but men who became eyewitnesses of the majesty of that man.

17. For having received from God the Father honor and glory from a voice of such kind brought to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my Son, the beloved in whom I am well pleased.

18. And we heard this voice, which was brought out of heaven, being with him on the holy mountain.

19. And we have the prophetic word sure, to which ye do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the daystar arises in your hearts.

20. Knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture comes to pass of a personal interpretation.

21. For no prophecy was ever brought by a will of man, but holy men of God spoke, being led by the Holy Spirit.

## 2 Peter 2

1. But false prophets also developed among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will sneak in pernicious denominations, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.

2. And many will follow their wantonness, because of whom the way of the truth will be blasphemed.

3. And they will exploit you in greed with fabricated words, whose judgment is not idle for long, and their destruction will not slumber.

4. For if God did not spare agents who sinned, but delivered them up to chains of darkness, having been cast into hell being reserved for judgment,

5. and he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, the eighth, a herald of righteousness, when he brought on a flood upon the world of the irreverent,

6. and he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, being reduced to ashes, having made an example of men who were going to be irreverent,

7. and he rescued righteous Lot, being distressed by the conduct of the lawless in their licentiousness

8. (for that righteous man dwelling among them day after day, in the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds, it anguished his righteous soul),

9. the Lord knows how to rescue the pious out of temptation, and to hold in reserve unrighteous men being cut off for a day of judgment.

10. And especially those going rear of flesh in a degenerate lust, and who despise lordship. Reckless, self-willed men, they do not tremble when speaking evil of dignities.

11. Whereas agents, being greater in might and power, do not bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.

12. But these men, like irrational beasts of nature, having been born for capture and destruction, speaking evil at which things they do not understand, will be destroyed in their corruption,

13. getting back a wage of unrighteousness. Men who consider soft living in the daytime to be pleasure, spots and blemishes reveling in their deceitfulness, feasting together with you,

14. having eyes full of adultery, and unceasing sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, children of a curse,

15. having forsaken a straight path, they were led astray, men who followed the way of Balaam, son of Beor, who loved the wage of unrighteousness.

16. But he had a rebuke of his own lawbreaking. A mute donkey, uttering in a man's voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.

17. These men are waterless wells, and clouds driven by a fierce wind, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved into an age.

18. For, uttering swollen things of vanity, they entice (to sensuality by lusts of flesh) those who actually escaped from those who live in error,

19. promising them freedom, while they themselves are bondmen of corruption, for by what any man has been overcome, of this he has also been enslaved.

20. For if, having escaped the defilements of the world by knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and, having been again entangled in these, they are overcome, the last things have become worse for them than the first.

21. For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.

22. But that of the true proverb has happened to them, The dog returning to his own vomit, and the sow that washed to wallowing in mire.

## 2 Peter 3

1. I write to you now this second letter, beloved, in which I arouse your sincere mind by a reminder,

2. to remember the sayings that were earlier spoken by the holy prophets, and of the command of your apostles of the Lord and Savior.

3. Knowing this first, that there will come at the end of the days, scoffers, proceeding according to their own desires,

4. and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For, from since the fathers became asleep, all things continue this way from the beginning of creation.

5. For this is willfully ignored by them, that long ago there were heavens, and an earth that came together out of water and by water by the word of God,

6. by which the world then perished, having been overflowed with water.

7. But now the heavens and the earth, which have been stored up by the same word, are being preserved for fire in a day of judgment and destruction of irreverent men.

8. But beloved, let not this one thing be ignored by you, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

9. The Lord is not slack about his promise, as some regard slackness, but is patient toward us, not wanting any to perish, but all to go forward to repentance.

10. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, during which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, being intensely hot, will be disintegrated, and the earth and the works in it will be destroyed by fire.

11. Therefore, all these things being disintegrated, what kind ought ye to be in holy actions and pieties,

12. anticipating and hastening the coming of the day of God, by which the heavens, being made fiery hot, will be disintegrated, and the elements dissolve, being intensely hot?

13. But we anticipate a new heavens and a new earth according to his promise, in which righteousness dwells.

14. Therefore, beloved, anticipating these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, without spot and blameless.

15. And consider the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation, just as also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him,

16. as also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist, as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.

17. Ye therefore, beloved, knowing in advance, keep watch, lest, having accommodated to the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own steadfastness.

18. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him is the glory both now and into the day of the age. Truly.
