## Psalms 1

1. Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers,

2. but his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and on his law he meditates day and night.

3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. And whatever he does shall prosper.

4. The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.

5. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6. For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.

## Psalms 2

1. Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate vain things?

2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying,

3. Let us break their bonds apart, and cast away their cords from us.

4. He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.

5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his great displeasure.

6. Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

7. I will tell of the decree. Jehovah said to me, Thou are my Son, this day I have begotten thee.

8. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the outermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

9. Thou shall break them with a rod of iron, thou shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

10. Now therefore be wise, O ye kings. Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.

11. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

## Psalms 3

1. Jehovah, how my adversaries are increased! Many are those who rise up against me.

2. Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.

3. But thou, O Jehovah, are a shield about me, my glory and he who lifts up of my head.

4. I cry to Jehovah with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.

5. I laid down and slept. I awoke, for Jehovah sustains me.

6. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people who have set themselves against me round about.

7. Arise, O Jehovah. Save me, O my God. For thou have smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone. Thou have broken the teeth of the wicked.

8. Salvation belongs to Jehovah. Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah.

## Psalms 4

1. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness. Thou have enlarged me in distress. Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

2. O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.

3. But know that Jehovah has set apart for himself him who is holy. Jehovah will hear when I call to him.

4. Stand in awe, and sin not. Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.

5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in Jehovah.

6. Many there are who say, Who will show us good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

7. Thou have put gladness in my heart more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.

8. In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for thou, Jehovah, alone make me dwell in safety.

## Psalms 5

1. Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.

2. Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God, for to thee do I pray.

3. O Jehovah, in the morning thou shall hear my voice. In the morning I will direct to thee, and will keep watch.

4. For thou are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil shall not sojourn with thee.

5. The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight. Thou hate all workers of iniquity.

6. Thou will destroy those who speak lies. Jehovah abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.

7. But as for me, in the abundance of thy loving kindness I will come into thy house. In thy fear I will worship toward thy holy temple.

8. Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of my enemies. Make thy way straight before my face.

9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their inward part is very wickedness. Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongue they deceive.

10. Hold them guilty, O God. Let them fall by their own counsels. Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions. For they have rebelled against thee.

11. But let all those who take refuge in thee rejoice. Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defend them. Let those also who love thy name be joyful in thee.

12. For thou will bless the righteous man, O Jehovah. Thou will encompass him with favor as with a shield. Selah.

## Psalms 6

1. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

2. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am withered away. O Jehovah, heal me, for my bones are troubled.

3. My soul also is greatly troubled. And thou, O Jehovah, how long?

4. Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul. Save me for thy loving kindness' sake.

5. For in death there is no remembrance of thee. In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?

6. I am weary with my groaning. Every night I make my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears.

7. My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.

8. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.

9. Jehovah has heard my supplication. Jehovah will receive my prayer.

10. All my enemies shall be put to shame and greatly troubled. They shall turn back. They shall be put to shame suddenly.

## Psalms 7

1. O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,

2. lest they tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

3. O Jehovah my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands,

4. if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me, (yea, I have delivered him without cause who was my adversary),

5. let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it. Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.

6. Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger. Lift up thyself against the rage of my adversaries, and awake for me the justice thou have commanded.

7. And let the congregation of the peoples encompass thee about, and return thou on high over them.

8. Jehovah shall judge the peoples. Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.

9. O let the wickedness of the wicked man come to an end, but establish thou the righteous man. For the righteous God tries the minds and hearts.

10. My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.

11. God is a righteous judge. Yea, a God who has indignation every day.

12. If a man does not repent, he will whet his sword. He has bent his bow, and made it ready.

13. He has also prepared for him the instruments of death. He makes his arrows fiery.

14. Behold the wicked man, he travails with iniquity. Yea, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

15. He has made a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.

16. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own scalp.

17. I will give thanks to Jehovah according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.

## Psalms 8

1. O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who has set thy glory upon the heavens!

2. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou have perfected praise, because of thine adversaries, that thou might still the enemy and the avenger.

3. When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou have ordained,

4. what is man that thou remember him? And the son of man that thou succor him?

5. For thou have made him but little lower than agents, and crowned him with glory and honor.

6. Thou make him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Thou have put all things under his feet.

7. All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field,

8. the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes through the paths of the seas.

9. O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

## Psalms 9

1. I will give thanks to Jehovah with my whole heart. I will show forth all thy marvelous works.

2. I will be glad and exult in thee. I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.

3. When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish at thy presence.

4. For thou have maintained my right and my cause. Thou sit in the throne judging righteously.

5. Thou have rebuked the nations. Thou have destroyed the wicked. Thou have blotted out their name forever and ever.

6. The enemy have come to an end. They are desolate forever, and the cities which thou have overthrown. The very memory of them is perished,

7. but Jehovah will endure forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment,

8. and he will judge the world in righteousness. He will minister justice to the peoples in uprightness.

9. Jehovah will also be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble.

10. And those who know thy name will put their trust in thee, for thou, Jehovah, have not forsaken those who seek thee.

11. Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwells in Zion. Declare among the people his doings.

12. For he who makes inquiry for blood remembers them. He does not forget the cry of the poor.

13. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah. Behold my affliction from those who hate me, thou who lifts me up from the gates of death

14. that I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.

15. The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.

16. Jehovah has made himself known. He has executed justice. The wicked man is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

17. Wicked men shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.

18. For a needy man shall not always be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish forever.

19. Arise, O Jehovah, let not man prevail. Let the nations be judged in thy sight.

20. Put them in fear, O Jehovah. Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah.

## Psalms 10

1. Why do thou stand afar off, O Jehovah? Why do thou hide thyself in times of trouble?

2. In the pride of the wicked man the poor man is hotly pursued. Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.

3. For the wicked man boasts of his heart's desire. And the greedy man renounces, yea, despises Jehovah.

4. The wicked man, in the pride of his countenance, says, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God.

5. His ways are profane at all times. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight. As for all his adversaries, he puffs at them.

6. He says in his heart, I shall not be moved. To all generations I shall not be in adversity.

7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

8. He sits in the lurking-places of the villages. In the covert places he murders the innocent man. His eyes are secretly set against the poor man.

9. He lurks in secret as a lion in his covert. He lies in wait to catch the poor man. He catches the poor man when he draws him in his net.

10. He crouches, he bows down, and helpless men fall by his strong men.

11. He says in his heart, God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.

12. Arise, O Jehovah, O God, lift up thy hand. Do not forget the poor.

13. Why does the wicked man despise God, and say in his heart, Thou will not require it?

14. Thou have seen. For thou behold mischief and spite, to repay with thy hand. The poor man commits himself to thee. Thou have been the helper of the fatherless.

15. Break thou the arm of the sinner and the evil man. His wickedness shall be sought, and shall not be found.

16. Jehovah is King forever and ever. The nations have perished out of his land.

17. Jehovah, thou have heard the desire of the humble. Thou will prepare their heart, thou will cause thine ear to hear,

18. to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may no more be terrible.

## Psalms 11

1. In Jehovah I take refuge. How will ye say to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain.

2. For, lo, the wicked bend the bow. They make ready their arrow upon the string that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.

3. If the foundations be destroyed, what can a righteous man do?

4. Jehovah is in his holy temple. Jehovah's throne is in heaven. His eyes, behold, his eyelids try, the sons of men.

5. Jehovah tries the righteous man, but his soul hates the wicked man and him who loves violence.

6. He will rain snares upon sinners. Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.

7. For Jehovah is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright man shall behold his face.

## Psalms 12

1. Help, Jehovah, for the holy man ceases, for the faithful fail from among the sons of men.

2. They speak falsehood everyone with his neighbor. With flattering lip, and with a double heart, they speak.

3. Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks great things,

4. who have said, With our tongue will we prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?

5. Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, now I will arise, says Jehovah. I will set him in the safety he gasps for.

6. The words of Jehovah are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace on the earth, purified seven times.

7. Thou will keep them, O Jehovah. Thou will preserve them from this generation forever.

8. The wicked walk on every side when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.

## Psalms 13

1. How long, O Jehovah? Will thou forget me forever? How long will thou hide thy face from me?

2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?

3. Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God. Lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the death,

4. lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him, lest my adversaries rejoice when I am moved.

5. But I have trusted in thy loving kindness. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.

6. I will sing to Jehovah because he has dealt bountifully with me.

## Psalms 14

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is none that does good.

2. Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God.

3. They are all gone aside. They are together become filthy. There is none who does good, no, not one.

4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon Jehovah?

5. There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous.

6. Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor because Jehovah is his refuge.

7. O that the salvation of Israel came out of Zion! When Jehovah brings back the captivity of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 15

1. Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

2. He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks truth in his heart,

3. he who does no slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor,

4. in whose eyes a reprobate is despised, but who honors those who fear Jehovah, he that swears to his own hurt, and changes not,

5. he who puts not his money out to interest, nor takes a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.

## Psalms 16

1. Preserve me, O God, for in thee do I take refuge.

2. Thou my soul have said to Jehovah, Thou are my Lord. I have no good beyond thee.

3. As for the sanctified who are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all my delight.

4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts for another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names upon my lips.

5. Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup. Thou maintain my lot.

6. The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places. Yea, I have a fine heritage.

7. I will bless Jehovah, who has given me counsel. Yea, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.

8. I beheld Jehovah always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices. My flesh also shall dwell in hope.

10. For thou will not leave my soul to Sheol, nor will thou allow thy holy man to see corruption.

11. Thou made known to me the path of life. Thou will fill me of joy with thy countenance.

## Psalms 17

1. Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend to my cry. Give ear to my prayer, that goes not out of feigned lips.

2. Let my justice come forth from thy presence. Let thine eyes look upon equity.

3. Thou have proved my heart. Thou have visited me in the night. Thou have tried me, and find nothing. I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

4. As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept from the ways of a violent man.

5. My steps have held fast to thy paths. My feet have not slipped.

6. I have called upon thee, for thou will answer me, O God. Incline thine ear to me, and hear my speech.

7. Show thy marvelous loving kindness, O thou who saves by thy right hand those who take refuge from those who rise up.

8. Keep me as the apple of the eye. Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,

9. from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly enemies, who encompass me around.

10. They are enclosed in their own fat. With their mouth they speak proudly.

11. They have now encompassed us in our steps. They set their eyes to cast down to the earth.

12. He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.

13. Arise, O Jehovah, confront him. Cast him down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword,

14. from men by thy hand, O Jehovah, from men of the world whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fill with thy treasure. They are satisfied with sons, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

15. As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy form.

## Psalms 18

1. I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.

2. Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.

3. I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised. So I shall be saved from my enemies.

4. The cords of death encompassed me, and the floods of lawlessness made me afraid.

5. The cords of Sheol were round about me. The snares of death came upon me.

6. In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry before him came into his ears.

7. Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken because he was angry.

8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.

9. He also bowed the heavens, and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.

10. And he rode upon a cherub, and flew. Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.

11. He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

12. At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.

13. Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.

14. And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them, Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.

15. Then the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at thy rebuke, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

16. He sent from on high, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.

18. They came upon me in the day of my calamity, but Jehovah was my stay.

19. He also brought me forth into a large place. He delivered me because he delighted in me.

20. Jehovah has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.

21. For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

22. For all his ordinances were before me, and I put not away his statutes from me.

23. I was also perfect with him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.

24. Therefore Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

25. With the merciful thou will show thyself merciful. With the perfect man thou will show thyself perfect.

26. With the pure thou will show thyself pure. And with the perverse thou will show thyself contrary.

27. For thou will save the afflicted people, but the haughty eyes thou will bring down.

28. For thou will light my lamp. Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.

29. For by thee I run upon a troop, and by my God I leap over a wall.

30. As for God, his way is perfect. The word of Jehovah is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.

31. For who is God, except Jehovah? And who is a rock, besides our God,

32. the God who girds me with strength, and makes my way perfect?

33. He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me upon my high places.

34. He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.

35. Thou have also given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand has held me up, and thy gentleness has made me great.

36. Thou have enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.

37. I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.

38. I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.

39. For thou have girded me with strength to the battle. Thou have subdued under me those who rose up against me.

40. Thou have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.

41. They cried, but there was none to save, even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.

42. Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.

43. Thou have delivered me from the strivings of the people. Thou have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.

44. As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.

45. The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their close places.

46. Jehovah lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,

47. even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me.

48. He rescues me from my enemies. Yea, thou lift me up above those who rise up against me. Thou deliver me from the violent man.

49. Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, among the Gentiles, and will sing praises to thy name.

50. He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.

## Psalms 19

1. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows his handiwork.

2. Day to day utters speech, and night to night shows knowledge.

3. There is no speech nor language in which their voice is not heard.

4. Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tabernacle for the sun,

5. which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run his course.

6. His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit to the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat of it.

7. The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul. The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making a simple man wise.

8. The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes.

9. The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring forever. The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether.

10. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold. Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.

11. Moreover by them thy servant is warned. In keeping them there is great reward.

12. Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults.

13. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I shall be upright, and I shall be clear from great transgression.

14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.

## Psalms 20

1. Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble. The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high,

2. send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion,

3. remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt-sacrifice (Selah),

4. grant thee thy heart's desire, and fulfill all thy counsel.

5. We will triumph in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. Jehovah fulfill all thy petitions.

6. Now I know that Jehovah saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.

7. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.

8. They are bowed down and fallen, but we are risen, and stand upright.

9. Save, Jehovah! Let the King answer us when we call.

## Psalms 21

1. The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah. And in thy salvation how greatly he shall rejoice!

2. Thou have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.

3. For thou meet him with the blessings of goodness. Thou set a crown of fine gold on his head.

4. He asked life from thee. Thou gave it him, even length of days forever and ever.

5. His glory is great in thy salvation. Honor and majesty thou do lay upon him.

6. For thou make him most blessed forever. Thou make him glad with joy in thy presence.

7. For the king trusts in Jehovah. And through the loving kindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.

8. Thy hand will find out all thine enemies. Thy right hand will find out those who hate thee.

9. Thou will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger. Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

10. Thou will destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.

11. For they intended evil against thee. They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.

12. For thou will make them turn their back. Thou will make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.

13. Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength. We will sing and praise thy power.

## Psalms 22

1. My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me, far from helping me, and the words of my groaning?

2. O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answer not, and in the night season, and I am not silent.

3. But thou are holy, O thou who inhabit the praises of Israel.

4. Our fathers trusted in thee. They trusted, and thou delivered them.

5. They cried to thee, and were delivered. They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.

6. But I am a worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and despised by the people.

7. All those who see me laugh me to scorn. They shoot out the lip. They shake the head, saying,

8. He trusted on Jehovah. Let him deliver him. Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.

9. But thou are he who took me out of the womb. Thou made me trust upon my mother's breasts.

10. I was cast upon thee from the womb. Thou are my God since my mother bore me.

11. Be not far from me, for trouble is near, for there is none to help.

12. Many bulls have encompassed me. Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me around.

13. They gape upon me with their mouth, as a ravening and a roaring lion.

14. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within me.

15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue clings to my jaws, and thou have brought me into the dust of death.

16. For dogs have encompassed me. A company of evildoers have enclosed me. They pierced my hands and my feet.

17. I may count all my bones. They look and stare upon me.

18. They part my garments among them, and upon my vesture do they cast a lot.

19. But be thou not far off, O Jehovah. O thou my succor, hasten thee to help me.

20. Deliver my soul from the sword, the only one of me from the power of the dog.

21. Save me from the lion's mouth, yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen. Thou have answered me.

22. I will declare thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.

23. Ye who fear Jehovah, praise him. All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him, and stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.

24. For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither has he hid his face from him, but when he cried to him, he heard.

25. From thee comes my praise in the great assembly. I will pay my vows before those who fear him.

26. The meek shall eat and be satisfied. They shall praise Jehovah who seek after him. Let your heart live forever.

27. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Jehovah, and all the kinfolk of the nations shall worship before thee.

28. For the kingdom is Jehovah's, and he is the ruler over the nations.

29. All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship. All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him, even he who cannot keep his soul alive.

## Psalms 26

1. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity. I have also trusted in Jehovah without wavering.

2. Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind.

3. For thy loving kindness is before my eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.

5. For in the day of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion. In the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me. He will lift me up upon a rock.

6. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing, yea, I will sing praises to Jehovah.

3. Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts.

4. Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. Give them after the operation of their hands. Render to them their recompense,

5. because they regard not the works of Jehovah, nor the operation of his hands. He will break them down and not build them up.

5. For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy is in the morning.

6. As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.

7. Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor had made my mountain to stand strong. Thou hid thy face; I was troubled.

9. What profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? Shall it declare thy truth?

10. Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me. Jehovah, be thou my helper.

11. Thou have turned for me my mourning into dancing. Thou have loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness,

12. to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks to thee forever.

## Psalms 31

1. In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge. Let me never be put to shame. Deliver me in thy righteousness.

5. Into thy hand I commend my spirit. Thou have redeemed me, O Jehovah, thou God of truth.

6. I hate those who regard lying vanities, but I trust in Jehovah.

7. I will be glad and rejoice in thy loving kindness, for thou have seen my affliction. Thou have known my soul in adversities,

8. and thou have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. Thou have set my feet in a large place.

9. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress. My eye wastes away with grief, yea, my soul and my body.

10. For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing. My strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones are wasted away.

14. But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah. I said, Thou are my God.

15. My times are in thy hand. Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.

16. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant. Save me in thy loving kindness.

19. O how great is thy goodness, which thou have laid up for those who fear thee, which thou have wrought for those who take refuge in thee before the sons of men!

21. Blessed be Jehovah, for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city.

22. As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes. Nevertheless thou heard the voice of my supplications when I cried to thee.

24. Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye who hope in Jehovah.

12. What man is he who desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?

3. Draw out the spear also, and stop the way against those who pursue me. Say to my soul, I am thy salvation.

4. Let them be put to shame and brought to dishonor who seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and confounded who devise my hurt.

5. Let them be as chaff before the wind, and the agent of Jehovah driving them on.

6. Let their way be dark and slippery, and the agent of Jehovah pursuing them.

7. For without cause they have hid their net for me in a pit. Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.

9. And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah. It shall rejoice in his salvation.

10. All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is like thee, who delivers a poor man from him who is too strong for him, yea, a poor and needy man from him who robs him?

11. Unrighteous witnesses rise up, they ask me of things that I know not.

12. They reward me evil for good, to the bereaving of my soul.

13. But as for me, when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth. I afflicted my soul with fasting, and my prayer returned into my own bosom.

14. I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother. I bowed down mourning, as he who bewails his mother.

15. But in my adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together. The wretches gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not. They tore me, and ceased not.

24. Judge me, O Jehovah my God, according to thy righteousness, and let them not rejoice over me.

25. Let them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it. Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

26. Let them be put to shame and confounded together who rejoice at my hurt. Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.

27. Let them shout for joy, and be glad, who favor my righteous cause. Yea, let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified, who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

28. And my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.

## Psalms 36

1. The transgression of the wicked man says within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.

2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes, that his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.

3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. He has ceased to be wise and to do good.

5. Thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, is in the heavens, thy faithfulness to the skies.

6. Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God. Thy judgments are a great deep. O Jehovah, thou preserve man and beast.

7. How precious is thy loving kindness, O God, and the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.

8. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and thou will make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

9. For with thee is the fountain of life. In thy light we shall see light.

10. O continue thy loving kindness to those who know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

11. Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of sinners drive me away.

12. There are the workers of iniquity fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.

4. Delight thyself also in Jehovah, and he will give thee the desires of thy heart.

5. Commit thy way to Jehovah. Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.

6. And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy justice as the noon-day.

7. Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him. Fret not thyself because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.

8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Fret not thyself, it tends only to evil-doing.

9. For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.

10. For yet a little while, and the wicked man shall not be. Yea, thou shall diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.

18. Jehovah knows the days of the perfect, and their inheritance shall be forever.

19. They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

20. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of Jehovah is as the fat of lambs: they shall disintegrate; they shall disintegrate away into smoke.

21. The wicked man borrows, and pays not again, but the righteous man deals graciously, and gives.

22. For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land, and those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.

23. A man's goings are established by Jehovah, and he delights in his way.

24. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for Jehovah upholds him with his hand.

25. I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen a righteous man forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

26. All the day long he deals graciously, and lends, and his seed is blessed.

27. Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore.

28. For Jehovah loves justice, and forsakes not his sanctified. They are preserved forever, but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

29. The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell in it forever.

30. The mouth of a righteous man talks of wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.

31. The law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide.

32. A wicked man watches a righteous man, and seeks to kill him.

33. Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.

34. Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land. When sinners are cut off, thou shall see it.

35. I have seen a wicked man in great power, and spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.

38. As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The end of the wicked shall be cut off.

39. But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble,

40. and Jehovah helps them, and rescues them. He rescues them from sinners, and saves them, because they have taken refuge in him.

## Psalms 38

1. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

2. For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presses me severely.

3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation, nor is there any health in my bones because of my sin.

4. For my iniquities have gone over my head. As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

5. My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.

6. I am pained and bowed down greatly. I go mourning all the day long.

7. For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned because of the disquietness of my heart.

9. Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.

10. My heart throbs, my strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.

11. Those I love and my friends stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand afar off.

12. Those also who seek after my life lay snares for me. And those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all the day long.

13. But I, as a deaf man, hear not. And I am as a mute man who opens not his mouth.

14. Yea, I am as a man who hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

15. For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope. Thou will answer, O Lord my God.

16. For I said, Lest they rejoice over me. When my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.

17. For I am ready to fall, and my sorrow is continually before me.

18. For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin.

19. But my enemies are energetic, and are strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

20. They also who render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow the thing that is good.

21. Forsake me not, O Jehovah. O my God, be not far from me.

22. Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.

## Psalms 39

1. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue. I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked man is before me.

2. I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from good, and my sorrow was stirred.

3. My heart was hot within me. While I was musing the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:

4. Jehovah, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is. Let me know how frail I am.

5. Behold, thou have made my days as handbreadths, and my life-time is as nothing before thee. Surely every man at his best condition is altogether vanity. Selah.

6. Surely every man walks in a shadow. Surely they are disquieted in vain. He heaps up, and knows not who shall gather them.

7. And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in thee.

8. Deliver me from all my transgressions. Make me not the reproach of the foolish.

9. I was mute. I opened not my mouth, because thou did it.

10. Remove thy stroke away from me. I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.

11. When thou have corrected man with rebukes for iniquity, thou make his beauty to disintegrate like a moth. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.

12. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear to my cry. Keep not silent at my tears, for I am a stranger with thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

13. O spare me, that I may recover strength before I go from here, and be no more.

## Psalms 40

1. I waited patiently for Jehovah, and he inclined to me, and heard my cry.

2. He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

3. And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Jehovah.

4. Blessed is the man who makes Jehovah his trust, and respects not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

5. Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou have done, and thy thoughts which are toward us. They cannot be set in order to thee. If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.

6. Sacrifice and offering thou did not desire, but a body thou have prepared for me. Whole burnt offering and sacrifice for sin thou did not require.

7. Then I said, Lo, I have come. In the volume of a book it is written of me.

8. I delight to do thy will, O my God. Yea, thy law is within my heart.

9. I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly. Lo, I will not refrain my lips. O Jehovah, thou know.

10. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart. I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy loving kindness and thy truth from the great assembly.

11. Withhold thou not thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah. Let thy loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve me,

12. for innumerable evils have encompassed me around. My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has failed me.

13. Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me. Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.

14. Let them be put to shame and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it. Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.

15. Let them be desolate because of their shame who say to me, Aha, aha.

16. Let all those who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee. Let such as love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified.

17. But I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks upon me. Thou are my help and my deliverer. Make no delay, O my God.

## Psalms 41

1. Blessed is he who considers a poor man. Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.

2. Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth. And thou do not deliver him to the will of his enemies.

3. Jehovah will support him upon the bed of languishing. Thou will make all his bed in his sickness.

4. I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.

5. My enemies speak evil against me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish?

6. And if he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.

7. All who hate me whisper together against me. Against me they devise my hurt.

8. An evil disease, they say, clings firm to him. And now that he lies he shall rise up no more.

9. Yea, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.

10. But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up that I may requite them.

11. By this I know that thou delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.

12. And as for me, thou uphold me in my integrity, and set me before thy face forever.

13. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Truly, and Truly.

## Psalms 42

1. As the hart pants after the water brooks, so my soul pants after thee, O God.

2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?

3. My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, Where is thy God?

4. These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.

5. Why are thou cast down, O my soul? And why are thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.

6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me. Therefore I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.

7. Deep calls to deep at the noise of thy waterfalls. All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me.

8. Yet Jehovah will command his loving kindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, even a prayer to the God of my life.

9. I will say to God my rock, Why have thou forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

10. As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me; while they continually say to me, Where is thy God?

11. Why are thou cast down, O my soul? And why are thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, the help of my countenance, and my God.

## Psalms 43

1. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against a profane nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

2. For thou are the God of my strength. Why have thou cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

3. O send out thy light and thy truth. Let them lead me. Let them bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

4. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will praise thee upon the harp, O God, my God.

5. Why are thou cast down, O my soul? And why are thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, the help of my countenance, and my God.

## Psalms 44

1. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou did in their days, in the days of old.

2. Thou drove out the nations with thy hand, but thou planted them. Thou afflicted the peoples, but thou spread them abroad.

3. For they did not get the land in possession by their own sword, nor did their own arm save them, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou were favorable to them.

4. Thou are my King, O God. Command deliverance for Jacob.

5. Through thee we will push down our adversaries. Through thy name we will tread them under who rise up against us.

6. For I will not trust in my bow, nor shall my sword save me.

7. But thou have saved us from our adversaries, and have put them to shame who hate us.

8. In God we have made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks to thy name forever. Selah.

9. But now thou have cast off, and brought us to dishonor, and go not forth with our armies.

10. Thou make us to turn back from the adversary. And those who hate us take spoil for themselves.

11. Thou have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.

12. Thou sell thy people for nothing, and have not increased by their price.

13. Thou make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are round about us.

14. Thou make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

15. All the day long my dishonor is before me, and the shame of my face has covered me,

16. for the voice of him who reproaches and blasphemes, because of the enemy and the avenger.

17. All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee, nor have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

18. Our heart is not turned back, nor have our steps declined from thy way,

19. that thou have greatly broken us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.

20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god,

21. will not God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.

22. Yea, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

23. Awake, why do thou sleep, O Lord? Arise, cast not off forever.

24. Why do thou hide thy face, and forget our affliction and our oppression?

25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our body clings to the ground.

26. Rise up for our help, and redeem us for thy loving kindness' sake.

## Psalms 45

1. My heart overflows with a good matter. I speak the things which I have made concerning the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

2. Thou are fairer than the sons of men. Grace is poured into thy lips. Therefore God has blessed thee forever.

3. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty.

4. And in thy majesty ride on prosperously because of truth and gentleness and righteousness. And thy right hand shall teach thee awesome things.

5. Thine arrows are sharp. The peoples fall under thee. They are in the heart of the king's enemies.

6. Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of straightness is the scepter of thy kingdom.

7. Thou have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.

8. All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.

9. Kings' daughters are among thy honorable women. At thy right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.

10. Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear. Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house.

11. So will the king desire thy beauty, for he is thy lord, and reverence thou him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre shall adore him with a gift. The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.

13. Inside, the king's daughter is all glorious. Her clothing is embroidered with gold.

14. She shall be led to the king in broidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to thee.

15. With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. They shall enter into the king's palace.

16. Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shall make rulers in all the earth.

17. I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall give thee thanks forever and ever.

## Psalms 46

1. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

2. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth changes, and though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas,

3. though the waters of it roar and are troubled, though the mountains tremble with the swelling of it. Selah.

4. There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.

5. God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God will help her, and that right early.

6. The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved, he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

7. Jehovah of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

8. Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what desolations he has made in the earth.

9. He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth. He breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in two. He burns the chariots in the fire.

10. Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth.

11. Jehovah of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

## Psalms 47

1. O clap your hands, all ye peoples. Shout to God with the voice of triumph.

2. For Jehovah Most High is awesome. He is a great King over all the earth.

3. He subdues peoples under us, and nations under our feet.

4. He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

5. God has gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.

6. Sing praise to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our King, sing praises.

7. For God is the King of all the earth. Sing ye praises with understanding.

8. God reigns over the nations. God sits upon his holy throne.

9. The nobles of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is greatly exalted.

## Psalms 48

1. Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.

2. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

3. God has made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.

4. For, lo, the kings assembled themselves. They passed by together.

5. They saw it, then were they amazed. They were dismayed, they hastened away.

6. Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail.

7. With the east wind thou break the ships of Tarshish.

8. As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God, God will establish it forever. Selah.

9. We have thought on thy loving kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.

10. As is thy name, O God, so is thy praise to the ends of the earth. Thy right hand is full of righteousness.

11. Let mount Zion be glad. Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of thy judgments.

12. Walk about Zion, and go round about her. Number the towers of it,

13. mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, that ye may tell it to the generation following.

14. For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.

## Psalms 49

1. Hear this, all ye peoples. Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,

2. both low and high, rich and poor together.

3. My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

4. I will incline my ear to a proverb. I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

5. Why should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my heels encompasses me about?

6. Those who trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches,

7. none can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him

8. (for the redemption of their life is costly, and it fails forever),

9. that he should still live always, that he should not see corruption.

10. For he shall see it. Wise men die. The fool and the brutish alike perish, and leave their wealth to others.

11. Their inward thought is that their houses are forever, their dwelling-places to all generations. They call their lands after their own names.

12. Even a man in splendor does not abide. He is like the beasts that perish.

13. This their way is their folly. Yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah.

14. They are appointed as a flock for Sheol. Death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for it.

15. But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah.

16. Be not thou afraid when a man is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased.

17. For when he dies he shall carry nothing away. His glory shall not descend after him.

18. Though while he lived he blessed his soul (and men praise thee, when thou do well for thyself),

19. he shall go to the generation of his fathers. They shall never see the light.

20. A man who is in splendor, and understands not, is like the beasts that perish.

## Psalms 50

1. The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof.

2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth.

3. Our God comes, and does not keep silence. A fire devours before him, and it is very tempestuous round about him.

4. He calls to the heavens above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.

5. Gather my sanctified together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God is judge himself. Selah.

7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify to thee, I am God, even thy God.

8. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices, and thy burnt offerings being continually before me.

9. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds.

10. For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

11. I know all the birds of the mountains, and the wild beasts of the field are mine.

12. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.

13. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

14. Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay thy vows to the Most High.

15. And call upon me in the day of trouble. I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me.

16. But to the wicked man God says, What have thou to do to declare my statutes, and that thou have taken my covenant in thy mouth,

17. since thou hate instruction, and cast my words behind thee?

18. When thou saw a thief, thou consented with him, and have been partaker with adulterers.

19. Thou give thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frames deceit.

20. Thou sit and speak against thy brother; thou slander thine own mother's son.

21. These things thou have done, and I kept silence. Thou thought that I was altogether such a one as thyself. But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

22. Now consider this, ye who forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:

23. Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me. And to him who orders his way aright I will show the salvation of God.

## Psalms 51

1. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness. According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.

2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

3. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.

4. Against thee, thee only, I have sinned, and done that which is evil in thy sight, that thou may be justified when thou speak, and may prevail when thou are criticized.

5. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me.

6. Behold, thou desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part thou will make me to know wisdom.

7. Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

8. Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou have broken may rejoice.

9. Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

11. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.

12. Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.

13. Then I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted to thee.

14. Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation. And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.

15. O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.

16. For thou delight not in sacrifice, else I would give it. Thou have no pleasure in burnt offering.

17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise.

18. Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion. Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

19. Then thou will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offering and in whole burnt offering. Then they will offer bullocks upon thine altar.

## Psalms 52

1. Why boast thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The loving kindness of God is continual.

2. Thy tongue devises wickedness, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

3. Thou love evil more than good, and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.

4. Thou love all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

5. God will likewise destroy thee forever. He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.

6. The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,

7. Lo, this is the man who did not make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.

8. But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the loving kindness of God forever and ever.

9. I will give thee thanks forever, because thou have done it. And I will hope in thy name in the presence of thy sanctified, for it is good.

## Psalms 53

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity. There is none who does good.

2. God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who understood, who seek after God.

3. Every one of them has gone back. They have together become filthy. There is none who does good, no, not one.

4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon God?

5. There they were in great fear, where no fear was, for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against thee. Thou have put them to shame because God has rejected them.

6. O that the salvation of Israel came out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 54

1. Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy might.

2. Hear my prayer, O God. Give ear to the words of my mouth.

3. For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul. They have not set God before them. Selah.

4. Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is of those who uphold my soul.

5. He will requite the evil to my enemies. Destroy thou them in thy truth.

6. With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to thee. I will give thanks to thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.

7. For he has delivered me out of all trouble, and my eye has seen it upon my enemies.

## Psalms 55

1. Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not thyself from my supplication.

2. Attend to me, and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and moan,

3. because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger they persecute me.

4. My heart is greatly pained within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

5. Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.

6. And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away, and be at rest.

7. Lo, then I would wander far off. I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.

8. I would hasten myself to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest.

9. Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongue, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

10. Day and night they go about it, upon the walls of it. Iniquity and mischief also are in the midst of it.

11. Wickedness is in the midst of it. Oppression and deceit depart not from its streets.

12. For it was not an enemy who reproached me. Then I could have borne it. Neither was it he who hated me that magnified himself against me. Then I would have hid myself from him.

13. But it was thou, a man my equal, my companion, and my familiar friend.

14. We took sweet counsel together. We walked in the house of God with the throng.

15. Let death come suddenly upon them. Let them go down alive into Sheol. For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.

16. As for me, I will call upon God, and Jehovah will save me.

17. Evening, and morning, and at noonday, I will complain and moan. And he will hear my voice.

18. He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there were many by me.

19. God will hear, and respond to them, (even he who abides of old), Selah, men who have no changes, and who fear not God.

20. He has put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him. He has profaned his covenant.

21. His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.

22. (Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee. He will never allow the righteous man to be moved.)

23. But thou, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in thee.

## Psalms 56

1. Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up. Fighting all the day long he oppresses me.

2. My enemies would swallow me up all the day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me.

3. What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee.

4. In God I will praise his word. In God I have put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?

5. All the day long they wrest my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil.

6. They gather themselves together. They hide themselves. They mark my steps, even as they have waited for my soul.

7. Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.

8. Thou number my wanderings. Put thou my tears into thy bottle. Are they not in thy book?

9. Then shall my enemies turn back in the day that I call. This I know, that God is for me.

10. In God I will praise his word. In Jehovah I will praise his word.

11. In God I have put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

12. Thy vows are upon me, O God. I will render thank offerings to thee.

13. For thou have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

## Psalms 57

1. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge in thee. Yea, in the shadow of thy wings I will take refuge until calamities be passed by.

2. I will cry to God Most High, to God who performs for me.

3. He will send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him who would swallow me up. Selah. God will send forth his loving kindness and his truth.

4. My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

5. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, thy glory above all the earth.

6. They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They have dug a pit before me. They are fallen into the midst of it themselves. Selah.

7. My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed. I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.

8. Awake up, my glory. Awake, psaltery and harp. I myself will awake right early.

9. I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to thee among the nations.

10. For thy loving kindness is great to the heavens, and thy truth to the skies.

11. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, thy glory above all the earth.

## Psalms 58

1. Do ye indeed speak righteousness in silence? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?

2. No! In heart ye work wickedness. Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.

3. The wicked are estranged from the womb. They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

4. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops her ear,

5. which hearkens not to the voice of charmers, charming ever so wisely.

6. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth. Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.

7. Let them melt away as water that runs with haste. When he aims his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off,

8. as a snail which melts and passes away, as the untimely birth of a woman, that has not seen the sun.

9. Before your pots can feel the thorns, he will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.

10. A righteous man shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,

11. so that men shall say, Truly there is a reward for the righteous man. Truly there is a God who judges in the earth.

## Psalms 59

1. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God. Set me on high from those who rise up against me.

2. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the bloodthirsty men.

3. For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul. The mighty gather themselves together against me, not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.

4. They run and prepare themselves without my fault. Awake thou to help me, and behold.

5. Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the nations. Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.

6. They return at evening. They howl like a dog, and go round about the city.

7. Behold, they belch out with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, for they say, Who hears?

8. But thou, O Jehovah, will laugh at them. Thou will have all the nations in derision.

9. O my strength, I will give heed to thee, for God is my high tower.

10. My God with his loving kindness will meet me. God will let me look upon my enemies.

11. Kill them not, lest my people forget. Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield,

12. for the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips. Let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak.

13. Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more. And let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the ends of the earth. Selah.

14. And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, and go round about the city.

15. They shall wander up and down for food, and tarry all night if they be not satisfied.

16. But I will sing of thy strength. Yea, I will sing aloud of thy loving kindness in the morning. For thou have been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress.

17. To thee, O my strength, I will sing praises. For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.

## Psalms 60

1. O God thou have cast us off. Thou have broken us down. Thou have been angry. O restore us again.

2. Thou have made the land to tremble. Thou have torn it. Heal the breaking of it, for it shakes.

3. Thou have shown thy people hard things. Thou have made us to drink the wine of staggering.

4. Thou have given a banner to those who fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

5. That thy beloved ones may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and answer us.

6. God has spoken in his holiness. I will exult. I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.

8. Moab is my wash pot. Upon Edom I will cast my shoe. Philistia, shout thou because of me.

9. Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom?

10. Have not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou go not forth, O God, with our armies.

11. Give us help against the adversary, for vain is the help of man.

12. Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is who will tread down our adversaries.

## Psalms 61

1. Hear my cry, O God. Attend to my prayer.

3. How long will ye set upon a man, that ye may kill, all of you, like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?

5. My soul, wait thou in silence for God only, for my expectation is from him.

6. He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower. I shall not be moved.

7. With God is my salvation and my glory. The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

8. Trust in him at all times, ye people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Selah.

9. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go up. They are together lighter than vanity.

10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery. If riches increase, set not your heart on it.

11. God has spoken once, twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God.

12. Also to thee, O Lord, belongs loving kindness, for thou render to every man according to his work.

## Psalms 63

1. O God, thou are my God. I will earnestly seek thee. My soul thirsts for thee, my flesh longs for thee, in a dry and weary land, where is no water.

6. when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night-watches.

7. For thou have been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings I will rejoice.

8. My soul follows close after thee. Thy right hand upholds me.

9. But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

10. They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be a portion for foxes.

11. But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him shall glory, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.

## Psalms 64

1. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

2. Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, from the tumult of the workers of iniquity,

3. who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,

4. that they may shoot in secret places at a blameless man. Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

5. They encourage themselves in an evil purpose. They converse of laying snares secretly. They say, Who will see them?

6. They search out iniquities, saying, We have accomplished a diligent search. And the inward part of man and the heart are deep.

7. But God will shoot at them. With an arrow they shall suddenly be wounded.

8. So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them. All who see them shall wag the head.

6. who by his strength sets firm the mountains, being girded about with might,

7. who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples.

8. They also who dwell in the outermost parts are afraid at thy signs. Thou make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

9. Thou visit the earth, and water it; thou greatly enrich it. The river of God is full of water. Thou provide them grain when thou have so prepared the earth.

10. Thou water its furrows abundantly. Thou settle the ridges of it. Thou make it soft with showers. Thou bless the springing of it.

11. Thou crown the year with thy goodness, and thy paths drop fatness.

13. I will come into thy house with burnt offerings. I will pay thee my vows,

14. which my lips uttered, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.

15. I will offer to thee burnt offerings of fatlings, with the incense of rams. I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

16. Come, and hear, all ye who fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my soul.

17. I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.

18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear.

7. O God, when thou went forth before thy people, when thou marched through the wilderness (Selah)

8. the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God, Sinai at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

9. Thou, O God, sent a plentiful rain. Thou confirmed thine inheritance when it was weary.

10. Thy congregation dwelt in it. Thou, O God, prepared for the poor from thy goodness.

11. The Lord gave the word. Great was the company of those who published it.

23. that thou may dash thy foot in blood, that the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from enemies.

28. Thy God has commanded thy strength. Strengthen, O God, that which thou have wrought for us.

29. Because of thy temple at Jerusalem kings shall bring presents to thee.

30. Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, trampling under foot the pieces of silver. He has scattered the peoples that delight in war.

35. O God, awesome out of thy holy places, the God of Israel, he gives strength and power to his people. Blessed be God.

## Psalms 69

1. Save me, O God, for the waters have come in to my soul.

2. I sink in deep mire where there is no standing. I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

3. I am weary with my crying. My throat is dried. My eyes fail while I wait for my God.

4. Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who would cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. That which I took not away I have to restore.

5. O God, thou know my foolishness, and my sins are not hid from thee.

6. Let not those who wait for thee be put to shame through me, O lord Jehovah of hosts. Let not those who seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.

7. Because for thy sake I have borne reproach, shame has covered my face.

8. I have become a stranger to my brothers, and an alien to my mother's sons.

9. For the zeal of thy house has eaten me up, and the reproaches of those who reproach thee have fallen upon me.

10. When I wept in my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.

11. When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.

12. Those who sit in the gate talk of me, and I am the song of the drunkards.

13. But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Jehovah. In an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of thy loving kindness, answer me in the truth of thy salvation.

14. Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Let not the water flood overwhelm me, nor let the deep swallow me up. And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.

16. Answer me, O Jehovah, for thy loving kindness is good. According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou to me,

17. and hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily.

18. Draw near to my soul, and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.

19. Thou know my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before thee.

20. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none.

21. They also gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

22. Let their table before them become a snare, and when they are in peace, a trap, and for a stumbling block, and for a retribution to them.

23. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and bow down their back continually.

24. Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.

25. Let their habitation be desolate. Let none dwell in their tents.

26. For they persecute him whom thou have smitten, and they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou have wounded.

27. Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.

28. Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.

29. But I am poor and sorrowful. Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.

30. I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving,

31. and it will please Jehovah better than an ox, or a bullock that has horns and hoofs.

32. The meek have seen it, and are glad. Ye who seek after God, let your heart live.

33. For Jehovah hears the needy, and does not despise his prisoners.

34. Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moves therein.

35. For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.

36. The seed also of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell therein.

## Psalms 70

1. Hasten, O God, to deliver me. Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.

2. Let them be put to shame and confounded who seek after my soul. Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.

3. Let them be turned back because of their shame who say, Aha, aha.

4. Let all those who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee. And let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

5. But I am poor and needy. Make haste to me, O God. Thou are my help and my deliverer, O Jehovah. Delay thou not.

## Psalms 71

1. In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge. Let me never be put to shame.

2. Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me. Bow down thine ear to me, and save me.

3. Be thou to me a rock of habitation to which I may continually resort. Thou have given commandment to save me, for thou are my rock and my fortress.

4. Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of a wicked man, out of the hand of an unrighteous and cruel man.

5. For thou are my hope, O lord Jehovah, my trust from my youth.

6. By thee I have been held up from the womb. Thou are he who took me out of my mother's bowels. My praise shall be continually of thee.

7. I am as a wonder to many, but thou are my strong refuge.

8. My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, and with thy honor all the day.

9. Cast me not off in the time of old age. Forsake me not when my strength fails.

10. For my enemies speak concerning me, and those who watch for my soul take counsel together,

11. saying, God has forsaken him. Pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver.

12. O God, be not far from me. O my God, make haste to help me.

13. Let them be put to shame and consumed who are adversaries to my soul. Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor who seek my hurt.

14. But I will hope continually, and will praise thee yet more and more.

15. My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, of thy salvation all the day, for I know not the numbers.

16. I will come with the mighty acts of the lord Jehovah. I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

17. O God, thou have taught me from my youth, and I have declared thy wondrous works until now.

18. Yea, even when I am old and gray headed, O God, forsake me not, until I have declared thy strength to a generation, thy might to everyone who is to come.

19. Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, thou who have done great things. O God, who is like thee?

20. Thou, who have shown us many and great troubles, will revive us again, and will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.

21. Increase thou my greatness, and turn again and comfort me.

22. I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God. To thee I will sing praises with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises to thee, and my soul, which thou have redeemed.

24. My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long. For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, who seek my hurt.

## Psalms 72

1. Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness to the king's son.

2. He will judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with justice.

3. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills, in righteousness.

4. He will judge the poor of the people. He will save the sons of the needy, and will break in pieces the oppressor.

5. They shall fear thee while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.

6. He will come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.

7. In his days righteousness shall flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon is no more.

8. He shall also have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.

9. Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust.

10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

11. Yea, all kings shall fall down before him. All nations shall serve him.

12. For he will deliver a needy man when he cries, and a poor man, who has no helper.

13. He will have pity on a poor and needy man, and he will save the souls of the needy.

14. He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. And their blood will be precious in his sight,

15. and they shall live. And to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba. And men shall pray for him continually. They shall bless him all the day long.

16. There shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains. The fruit of it shall shake like Lebanon. And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

17. His name shall endure forever. His name shall be continued as long as the sun. And men shall be blessed in him. All nations shall call him blessed.

18. Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.

19. And blessed be his glorious name forever. And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Truly, and Truly.

20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

## Psalms 73

1. Surely God is good to Israel, to such as are pure in heart.

2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had well nigh slipped.

3. For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

4. For there are no pangs in their death, but their strength is firm.

5. They are not in trouble as other men, nor are they plagued like other men.

6. Therefore pride is as a chain around their neck. Violence covers them as a garment.

7. Their eyes stand out with fatness. They have more than heart could wish.

8. They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression. They speak loftily.

9. They have set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.

10. Therefore his people return here, and waters of a full cup are drained by them.

11. And they say, How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?

12. Behold, these are the wicked, and those who always prosper. They have possessed wealth.

13. Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence,

14. for all the day long I have been plagued, and chastened every morning.

15. If I had said, I will speak thus, behold, I would have dealt treacherously with the generation of thy sons.

16. When I thought how I might understand this, it was too painful for me,

17. until I went into the sanctuary of God, and considered their latter end.

18. Surely thou set them in slippery places. Thou cast them down to destruction.

19. How they have become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.

20. As a dream from awakening, O Lord, when thou waken, thou will despise their form.

21. For my soul was grieved, and I was pricked in my heart.

22. So I was brutish, and ignorant. I was a beast before thee.

23. Nevertheless I am continually with thee. Thou have held my right hand.

24. Thou will guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

25. Whom have I in heaven? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.

26. My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

27. For, lo, those who are far from thee shall perish. Thou have destroyed all those who go a whoring from thee.

28. But it is good for me to draw near to God. I have made the lord Jehovah my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works.

## Psalms 74

1. O God, why have thou cast off forever? Why does thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

2. Remember thy congregation, which thou have gotten of old, which thou have redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance, and mount Zion, at which thou have dwelt.

3. Lift up thy feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.

4. Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly. They have set up their ensigns for signs.

5. They seemed as men who lifted up axes upon a thicket of trees.

6. And now they break down all the carved work of it with hatchet and hammers.

7. They have set thy sanctuary on fire. They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name to the ground.

8. They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether. They have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land.

9. We do not see our signs. There is no more any prophet, nor is there among us he who knows how long.

10. How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name forever?

11. Why do thou draw back thy hand, even thy right hand? Remove it from the midst of thy bosom.

12. Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

13. Thou divided the sea by thy strength. Thou break the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

14. Thou break the heads of leviathan in pieces. Thou gave him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

15. Thou split fountain and flood. Thou dried up mighty rivers.

16. The day is thine; the night is also thine. Thou have prepared the light and the sun.

17. Thou have set all the borders of the earth. Thou have made summer and winter.

18. Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Jehovah, and that a foolish people has blasphemed thy name.

19. O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove to the wild beast. Forget not the life of thy poor forever.

20. Have respect to the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.

21. O let not he who is oppressed return ashamed. Let a poor and needy man praise thy name.

22. Arise, O God, plead thine own cause. Remember how the foolish man reproaches thee all the day.

23. Forget not the voice of thine adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against thee ascends continually.

## Psalms 75

1. We give thanks to thee, O God. We give thanks, for thy name is near. Men tell of thy wondrous works.

2. When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly;

3. when the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved. I have set up the pillars of it. Selah.

4. I said to the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly, and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn.

5. Lift not up your horn on high. Speak not with a stiff neck.

6. For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes lifting up.

7. But God is the judge. He put one down, and lifts another up.

8. For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foams. It is full of mixture, and he pours out of the same, surely to the dregs of it. All the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.

9. But I will declare forever. I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

10. All the horns of the wicked I will also cut off, but the horns of a righteous man shall be lifted up.

## Psalms 76

1. In Judah God is known. His name is great in Israel.

2. In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling-place in Zion.

3. There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

4. Thou are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

5. The stouthearted are made a spoil. They have slept their sleep, and none of the men of might have found their hands.

6. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.

7. Thou, even thou, are to be feared. And who may stand in thy sight when once thou are angry?

8. Thou caused sentence to be heard from heaven. The earth feared and was still

9. when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

10. Surely the inward thought of man shall praise thee, even the residue of inward thought will observe a festival to thee.

11. Vow, and pay to Jehovah your God. Let all who are round about him bring presents to him who ought to be feared.

12. He will cut off the spirit of rulers. He is fearful to the kings of the earth.

## Psalms 77

1. I will cry to God with my voice, even to God with my voice, and he will give ear to me.

2. In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not. My soul refused to be comforted.

3. I remember God, and am disquieted. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.

4. Thou have held my eyelids watching. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

5. I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

6. I call to remembrance my song in the night. I commune with my own heart, and my spirit makes diligent search.

7. Will the Lord cast off forever? And will he be favorable no more?

8. Has his loving kindness entirely gone forever? Does his promise fail for evermore?

9. Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

10. And I said, This is my infirmity, the change of the right hand of the Most High.

11. I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah, for I will remember thy wonders of old.

12. I will meditate also upon all thy work, and muse on thy doings.

13. Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary. Who is a great god like God?

14. Thou are the God who does wonders. Thou have made known thy strength among the peoples.

15. With thine arm thou have redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

16. The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee. They were afraid. The depths also trembled.

17. The clouds poured out water. The skies sent out a sound. Thine arrows also went abroad.

18. The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lightened the world. The earth trembled and shook.

19. Thy way was in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters. And thy footsteps were not known.

20. Thou led thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

## Psalms 78

1. Give ear, O my people, to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

2. I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter dark sayings of old,

3. which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

4. We will not hide them from their sons, telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.

5. For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their sons,

6. that the generation to come might know, even the sons who should be born, who should arise and tell to their sons,

7. that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,

8. and might not be as their fathers: a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

9. The sons of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

10. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law.

11. And they forgot his doings, and his wondrous works that he had shown them.

12. He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through. And he made the waters to stand as a heap.

14. In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

15. He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.

16. He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

17. Yet they went on to still sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.

18. And they challenged God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.

19. Yea, they spoke against God. They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

20. Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?

21. Therefore Jehovah heard, and was angry. And a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel,

22. because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in his salvation.

23. Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven,

24. and he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them food from heaven.

25. Man ate the bread of the mighty. He sent them food to the full.

26. He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he guided the south wind.

27. He also rained flesh upon them as the dust, and winged birds as the sand of the seas.

28. And he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations.

29. So they ate, and were well filled, and he gave them their own desire.

30. They were not estranged from that which they desired. Their food was yet in their mouths

31. when the anger of God went up against them, and killed of the fattest of them, and smote down the young men of Israel.

32. For all this they still sinned, and did not believe in his wondrous works.

33. Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.

34. When he killed them, then they inquired after him, and they returned and sought God earnestly.

35. And they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.

36. But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.

37. For their heart was not right with him, nor were they faithful in his covenant.

38. But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and destroyed not. Yea, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.

39. And he remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and comes not again.

40. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!

41. And they turned again and challenged God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.

42. They did not remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary,

43. how he set his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan,

44. and turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.

45. He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.

46. He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.

47. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.

48. He also gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

49. He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of agents of evil.

50. He made a path for his anger. He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,

51. and smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.

52. But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

53. And he led them safely, so that they feared not, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

54. And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.

55. He also drove out the nations before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

56. Yet they challenged and rebelled against the Most High God, and kept not his testimonies,

57. but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

58. For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

59. When God heard, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel,

60. so that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,

61. and delivered their strength into captivity, and their glory into the adversary's hand.

62. He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.

63. Fire devoured their young men, and their virgins had no marriage-song.

64. Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.

65. Then the Lord awoke as out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.

66. And he smote his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.

67. Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,

68. but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

69. And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.

70. He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.

71. He brought him from following the ewes that have their young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

72. So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

## Psalms 79

1. O God, the nations have come into thine inheritance. They have defiled thy holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

2. They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be food to the birds of the heavens, the flesh of thy sanctified to the beasts of the earth.

3. They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.

4. We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are round about us.

5. How long, O Jehovah? Will thou be angry forever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?

6. Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that do not know thee, and upon the kingdoms that do not call upon thy name.

7. For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.

8. Do not remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers. Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are brought very low.

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name. And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake.

10. Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed be known among the nations in our sight.

11. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee. According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those who are appointed to death,

12. and render to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached thee, O Lord,

13. so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks forever. We will show forth thy praise to all generations.

## Psalms 80

1. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou who lead Joseph like a flock. Thou who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.

2. Stir up thy might before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, and come to save us.

3. Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

4. O Jehovah God of hosts, how long will thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?

5. Thou have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.

6. Thou make us hatred to our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.

7. Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

8. Thou brought a vine out of Egypt. Thou drove out the nations, and planted it.

9. Thou prepared place before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land.

10. The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs of it were like cedars of God.

11. It sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the River.

12. Why have thou broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?

13. The boar out of the wood ravages it, and the wild beasts of the field feed on it.

14. Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven, and, behold, and visit this vine,

15. and the stock which thy right hand planted, and the branch that thou made strong for thyself.

16. It is burned with fire, it is cut down. They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.

17. Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou made strong for thyself,

18. so shall we not go back from thee. Revive thou us, and we will call upon thy name.

19. Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts, cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

## Psalms 81

1. Sing aloud to God our strength. Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.

2. Raise a song, and bring here the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.

3. Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast-day.

4. For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

5. He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony when he went out over the land of Egypt, where I heard a language that I knew not.

6. I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket.

7. Thou called in trouble, and I delivered thee. I answered thee in the secret place of thunder. I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

8. Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee, O Israel, if thou would hearken to me!

9. There shall no strange god be in thee, nor shall thou worship any foreign god.

10. I am Jehovah thy God who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11. But my people hearkened not to my voice, and Israel would none of me.

12. So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels.

13. O that my people would hearken to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!

14. I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries.

15. (The haters of Jehovah feign obedience to him, but their time is forever.)

16. He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat. And I would satisfy thee with honey out of the rock.

## Psalms 82

1. God stands in the congregation of God. He judges among the gods.

2. How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah.

3. Judge the poor man and the orphan. Do justice to the afflicted and destitute man.

4. Rescue the poor and needy man. Deliver from the hand of the wicked man.

5. They know not, nor do they understand. They walk to and fro in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.

6. I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.

7. Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.

8. Arise, O God, judge the earth, for thou shall inherit all the nations.

## Psalms 83

1. O God, keep thou not silence. Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

2. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult, and those who hate thee have lifted up the head.

3. They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones.

4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

5. For they have consulted together with one consent. They make a covenant against thee:

6. the tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,

7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre,

8. Assyria also is joined with them; they have helped the sons of Lot. Selah.

9. Do thou to them as to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon,

10. who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.

11. Make their ranking men like Oreb and Zeeb, yea, all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna,

12. who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God.

13. O my God, make them like the whirling dust, as stubble before the wind,

14. as the fire that burns the forest, and as the flame that sets the mountains on fire.

15. So pursue them with thy tempest, and terrify them with thy storm.

16. Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.

17. Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever. Yea, let them be confounded and perish,

18. that they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth.

## Psalms 84

1. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!

2. My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of Jehovah. My heart and my flesh cry out to the living God.

3. Yea, the sparrow has found her a house, and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.

4. Blessed are those who dwell in thy house. They will still be praising thee. Selah.

5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.

6. Passing through the valley of weeping they make it a place of springs. Yea, the early rain covers it with blessings.

7. They go from strength to strength; each one of them appears before God in Zion.

8. O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer. Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

9. Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.

10. For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield. Jehovah will give grace and glory. He will withhold no good thing from those who walk uprightly.

12. O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in thee.

## Psalms 85

1. Jehovah, thou have been favorable to thy land. Thou have brought back the captivity of Jacob.

2. Thou have forgiven the iniquity of thy people. Thou have covered all their sin. Selah.

3. Thou have taken away all thy wrath. Thou have turned from the fierceness of thine anger.

4. Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine indignation toward us to cease.

5. Will thou be angry with us forever? Will thou draw out thine anger to all generations?

6. Will thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?

7. Show us thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, and grant us thy salvation.

8. I will hear what God, Jehovah, will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, and to his sanctified. But let them not turn again to folly.

9. Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.

10. Mercy and truth are met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

11. Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven.

12. Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good, and our land shall yield its increase.

13. Righteousness shall go before him, and shall make his footsteps a path.

## Psalms 86

1. Bow down thine ear, O Jehovah, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.

2. Preserve my soul, for I am devout. O thou my God, save thy servant who trusts in thee.

3. Be merciful to me, O Lord, for to thee do I cry all the day long.

4. Rejoice the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

5. For thou, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in loving kindness to all those who call upon thee.

6. Give ear, O Jehovah, to my prayer, and hearken to the voice of my supplications.

7. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee, for thou will answer me.

8. There is none like thee among the gods, O Lord, nor like thy works.

9. All nations whom thou have made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and they shall glorify thy name.

10. For thou are great, and do wondrous things. Thou alone are God.

11. Teach me thy way, O Jehovah, I will walk in thy truth. Unite my heart to fear thy name.

12. I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify thy name for evermore.

13. For great is thy loving kindness toward me, and thou have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

14. O God, the proud have risen up against me, and a company of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before them.

15. But thou, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.

16. O turn to me, and have mercy upon me. Give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.

17. Show me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it, and be put to shame, because thou, Jehovah, have helped me, and comforted me.

## Psalms 87

1. His foundation is in the holy mountains.

2. Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

3. Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

4. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among those who know me. Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This man was born there.

5. Yea, of Zion it shall be said, this and that man was born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.

6. Jehovah will count when he writes up the peoples: This man was born there. Selah.

7. Those who sing as well as those who dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.

## Psalms 88

1. O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee.

2. Let my prayer enter into thy presence. Incline thine ear to my cry.

3. For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.

4. I am reckoned with those who go down into the pit. I am as a man who has no help,

5. cast off among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom thou remember no more, and they are cut off from thy hand.

6. Thou have laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps.

7. Thy wrath lays hard upon me, and thou have afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.

8. Thou have put my acquaintances far from me. Thou have made me an abomination to them. I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.

9. My eye wastes away because of affliction. I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah, I have spread forth my hands to thee.

10. Will thou show wonders to the dead? Shall those who are deceased arise and praise thee? Selah.

11. Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave, or thy faithfulness in destruction?

12. Shall thy wonders be known in the dark, and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

13. But to thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer shall come before thee.

14. Jehovah, why do thou cast off my soul? Why do thou hide thy face from me?

15. I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer thy terrors I am confounded.

16. Thy fierce wrath has gone over me. Thy terrors have cut me off.

17. They came round about me like water all the day long. They encompassed me around together.

18. Thou have put beloved and friend far from me, and my acquaintances into darkness.

## Psalms 89

1. I will sing of the loving kindness of Jehovah forever. With my mouth I will make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever. Thy faithfulness thou will establish in the very heavens.

3. I have made a covenant with my chosen. I have sworn to David my servant:

4. Thy seed I will establish forever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.

5. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah, thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the sanctified.

6. For who in the clouds can be compared to Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like Jehovah,

7. a God very awesome in the council of the holy ones, and to be feared above all those who are round about him?

8. O Jehovah God of hosts, who is a mighty one like thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.

9. Thou rule the pride of the sea. When the waves of it arise, thou still them.

10. Thou have broken Rahab in pieces, as a wounded man. Thou have scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.

11. The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine, the world and the fullness of it; thou have founded them.

12. The north and the south, thou have created them. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.

13. Thou have a mighty arm. Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.

14. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne. Loving kindness and truth go before thy face.

15. Blessed is the people who know the joyful sound. They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.

16. In thy name do they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness are they exalted.

17. For thou are the glory of their strength, and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.

18. For our shield belongs to Jehovah, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.

19. Then thou spoke in a vision to thy sanctified, and said, I have laid help upon a mighty man. I have exalted a chosen man out of the people.

20. I have found David my servant. With my holy oil I have anointed him,

21. with whom my hand shall be established. My arm also shall strengthen him.

22. The enemy shall not exact from him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

23. And I will beat down his adversaries before him, and smite those who hate him,

24. but my faithfulness and my loving kindness shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.

25. I will also set his hand on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.

26. He shall cry to me, Thou are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.

27. I also will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.

28. I will keep my loving kindness for him for evermore. And my covenant shall stand fast with him.

29. I will also make his seed to endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.

30. If his sons forsake my law, and walk not in my ordinances,

31. if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments,

32. then I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes,

33. but my loving kindness I will not utterly take from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail.

34. I will not break my covenant, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

35. I have sworn once by my holiness; I will not lie to David.

36. His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.

37. It shall be established forever as the moon, and as the faithful witness in the sky. Selah.

38. But thou have cast off and rejected. Thou have been angry with thine anointed.

39. Thou have abhorred the covenant of thy servant. Thou have profaned his crown to the ground.

40. Thou have broken down all his hedges. Thou have brought his strongholds to ruin.

41. All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors.

42. Thou have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. Thou have made all his enemies to rejoice.

43. Yea, thou turn back the edge of his sword, and have not made him to stand in the battle.

44. Thou have made his brightness to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.

45. The days of his youth thou have shortened. Thou have covered him with shame. Selah.

46. How long, O Jehovah? Will thou hide thyself forever? Shall thy wrath burn like fire?

47. O remember how short my time is, for what vanity thou have created all the sons of men!

48. What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.

49. Lord, where are thy former loving kindnesses, which thou swore to David in thy faithfulness?

50. Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants, how I bear in my bosom all the mighty peoples,

51. with which thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, with which they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

52. Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Truly, and Truly.

## Psalms 90

1. Lord, thou have been our dwelling-place in all generations.

2. Before the mountains were brought forth, or thou had ever formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou are God.

3. Thou turn man to destruction, and say, Return, ye sons of men.

4. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.

5. Thou carry them away as with a flood. They are as a sleep. In the morning they are like grass which grows up.

6. In the morning it flourishes, and grows up. In the evening it is cut down, and withers.

7. For we are consumed in thine anger, and in thy wrath are we troubled.

8. Thou have set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.

9. For all our days are passed away in thy wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.

10. The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years, yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it is soon gone, and we fly away.

11. Who knows the power of thine anger, and thy wrath according to the fear that is due to thee?

12. So teach us to number our days, that we may get us a heart of wisdom.

13. Return, O Jehovah. How long? And relent concerning thy servants.

14. O satisfy us in the morning with thy loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

15. Make us glad according to the days in which thou have afflicted us, and the years in which we have seen evil.

16. Let thy work appear to thy servants, and thy glory upon their sons.

17. And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us. And establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.

## Psalms 91

1. He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

2. I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.

3. For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.

4. He will cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shall thou take refuge. His truth is a shield and a buckler.

5. Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flies by day,

6. for the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.

7. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come near thee.

8. Thou shall only behold with thine eyes, and see the reward of the wicked.

9. For thou, O Jehovah, are my refuge! Thou have made the Most High thy habitation.

10. There shall no evil befall thee, nor shall any plague come near thy tent,

11. for he will give his agents charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

12. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

13. Thou shall tread upon the lion and adder. The young lion and the serpent thou shall trample under foot.

14. Because he has set his love upon me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high because he has known my name.

15. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.

16. I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation.

## Psalms 92

1. It is a good thing to give thanks to Jehovah, and to sing praises to thy name, O Most High,

2. to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,

3. with an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery, with a solemn sound upon the harp.

4. For thou, Jehovah, have made me glad through thy work. I will triumph in the works of thy hands.

5. How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep.

6. A brutish man knows not, nor does a fool understand this.

7. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed forever,

8. but thou, O Jehovah, are on high for evermore.

9. For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish. All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

10. But thou have exalted my horn like the wild ox's. I am anointed with fresh oil,

11. and my eye has seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the evildoers who rise up against me.

12. A righteous man shall flourish like the palm tree. He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

13. Men who are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God.

14. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. They shall be full of sap and green

15. to show that Jehovah is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

## Psalms 93

1. Jehovah reigns! He is clothed with majesty. Jehovah is clothed with strength; he has girded himself with it. The world also is established that it cannot be moved.

2. Thy throne is established of old. Thou are from everlasting.

3. The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, the floods have lifted up their voice, the floods lift up their waves.

4. Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty.

5. Thy testimonies are very sure. Holiness befits thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.

## Psalms 94

1. O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongs, thou God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth.

2. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth. Render to the proud a recompense.

3. Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?

4. They prate, they speak arrogantly. All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.

5. They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, and afflict thy heritage.

6. They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless.

7. And they say, Jehovah will not see, nor will the God of Jacob consider.

8. Consider, ye brutish among the people, and ye fools, when will ye be wise?

9. He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not see?

10. He who chastises the nations, shall he not correct, even he who teaches man knowledge?

11. Jehovah knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

12. Blessed is the man whom thou chasten, O Jehovah, and teach out of thy law,

13. that thou may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for a wicked man.

14. For Jehovah will not cast off his people, nor will he forsake his inheritance.

15. For judgment shall return to righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

16. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

17. Unless Jehovah had been my help, my soul would have soon dwelt in silence.

18. When I said, My foot slips, thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, held me up.

19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.

20. Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, which frames mischief by statute?

21. They gather themselves together against the soul of a righteous man, and condemn innocent blood.

22. But Jehovah has been my high tower, and my God the rock of my refuge.

23. And he has brought upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Jehovah our God will cut them off.

## Psalms 95

1. O come, let us sing to Jehovah. Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let us make a joyful noise to him with psalms.

3. For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

4. In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his.

5. The sea is his, and he made it. And his hands formed the dry land.

6. O come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before Jehovah our maker.

7. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, O that ye would hear his voice!

8. Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, as the day of trial in the wilderness,

9. where your fathers challenged me, proved me, and saw my work.

10. Forty years long I was grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways.

11. Therefore I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.

## Psalms 96

1. O sing to Jehovah a new song. Sing to Jehovah, all the earth.

2. Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. Show forth his salvation from day to day.

3. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.

4. For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised. He is to be feared above all gods.

6. Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

7. Ascribe to Jehovah, ye kindred of the peoples. Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.

8. Ascribe to Jehovah the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts.

9. O worship Jehovah in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth.

10. Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns! The world also is established that it cannot be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity.

11. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof.

12. Let the field exult, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the wood shall sing for joy

13. before Jehovah, for he comes. For he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.

## Psalms 97

1. Jehovah reigns! Let the earth rejoice. Let the multitude of isles be glad.

2. Clouds and darkness are round about him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

3. A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about.

4. His lightnings lightened the world. The earth saw, and trembled.

5. The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

6. The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples have seen his glory.

7. Let all those be put to shame who serve graven images, who boast themselves of idols. Bow yourselves to him, all ye gods.

8. Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced, because of thy judgments, O Jehovah.

9. For thou, Jehovah, are most high above all the earth. Thou are exalted far above all gods.

10. O ye who love Jehovah, hate evil. He preserves the souls of his sanctified. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.

11. Light is sown for the righteous man, and gladness for the upright in heart.

12. Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous, and give thanks to the memory of his holiness.

## Psalms 98

2. Jehovah has made known his salvation. He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations.

3. He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

4. Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth. Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.

5. Sing praises to Jehovah with the harp. With the harp and the voice of melody,

6. with trumpets and sound of cornet, make a joyful noise before the King-Jehovah.

7. Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof, the world, and those who dwell in it.

8. Let the floods clap their hands. Let the hills sing for joy together

9. before Jehovah, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.

## Psalms 99

1. Jehovah reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits above the cherubim, let the earth be moved.

2. Jehovah is great in Zion, and he is high above all the peoples.

3. Let them praise thy great and awesome name. Holy is he.

4. The king's strength also loves justice. Thou establish equity. Thou execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.

5. Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and worship at his footstool. Holy is he.

6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon his name, they called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.

7. He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them.

8. Thou answered them, O Jehovah our God. Thou were a God who forgave them, though thou took vengeance on their doings.

9. Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and worship at his holy hill. For Jehovah our God is holy.

## Psalms 101

2. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will thou come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

3. I will set no base thing before my eyes. I hate the work of those who turn aside. It shall not cleave to me.

4. A perverse heart shall depart from me. I will know no evil thing.

5. He who slanders his neighbor secretly, him I will destroy. He who has a high look and a proud heart I will not endure.

6. My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he shall minister to me.

7. He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood shall not be established before my eyes.

8. Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.

## Psalms 102

1. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and let my cry come to thee.

2. Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress. Incline thine ear to me. In the day when I call answer me speedily.

3. For my days consume away like smoke, and my bones are burned as a firebrand.

4. My heart is smitten like grass, and withered, for I forget to eat my bread.

5. Because of the voice of my groaning my bones cling to my flesh.

6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I have become as an owl of the waste places.

7. I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone upon the house-top.

8. My enemies reproach me all the day. Those who are mad against me do curse by me.

9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

10. because of thine indignation and thy wrath. For thou have taken me up, and cast me away.

11. My days are like a shadow that declines, and I am withered like grass.

12. But thou, O Jehovah, will abide forever, and thy memorial to all generations.

13. Thou will arise, and have mercy upon Zion, for it is time to have pity upon her, yea, the set time has come.

14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity upon her dust.

15. So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

16. For Jehovah has built up Zion. He has appeared in his glory.

17. He has regarded the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer.

18. This shall be written for the generation to come. And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.

19. For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven Jehovah beheld the earth,

20. to hear the sighing of the prisoner, to loose those who are appointed to death,

21. that men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,

22. when the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.

23. He weakened my strength in the way. He shortened my days.

24. I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days. Thy years are throughout all generations.

25. Of old thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.

26. They shall perish, but thou shall endure. Yea, all of them shall grow old like a garment. As a vesture thou shall change them, and they shall be changed,

27. but thou are the same, and thy years shall have no end.

28. The sons of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.

## Psalms 103

1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

2. Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,

3. who forgives all thine iniquities, who heals all thy diseases,

4. who redeems thy life from destruction, who crowns thee with loving kindness and tender mercies,

5. who satisfies thy desire with good things, and thy youth is renewed like the eagle.

6. Jehovah executes righteous acts, and judgments for all who are oppressed.

7. He made known his ways to Moses, his doings to the sons of Israel.

8. Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.

9. He will not always chide, nor will he keep it forever.

10. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

11. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.

12. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.

13. Like as a father pities his sons, So Jehovah pities those who fear him.

14. For he knows our frame. He remembers that we are dust.

15. As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

16. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.

17. But the loving kindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear him, and his righteousness to son's sons,

18. to such as keep his covenant, and to those who remember his precepts to do them.

19. Jehovah has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.

20. Bless Jehovah, ye his agents, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, hearkening to the voice of his word.

21. Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, ye ministers of his, who do his pleasure.

22. Bless Jehovah, all ye his works in all places of his dominion. Bless Jehovah, O my soul.

## Psalms 104

1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou are very great. Thou are clothed with honor and majesty,

2. who covers thyself with light as with a garment, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,

3. who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds his chariot, who walks upon the wings of the wind,

4. who makes his agents spirits, his ministers a flame of fire,

5. who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved forever.

6. Thou covered it with the deep as with a vesture. The waters stood above the mountains.

7. At thy rebuke they fled. At the voice of thy thunder they hastened away.

8. The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place which thou had founded for them.

9. Thou have set a bound that they may not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.

10. He sends forth springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.

11. They give drink to every beast of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.

12. By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation. They sing among the branches.

13. He waters the mountains from his chambers. The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.

14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herbage for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth,

15. and wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart.

16. The trees of Jehovah are full, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,

17. where the birds make their nests. As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.

18. The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the conies.

19. He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows his going down.

20. Thou make darkness, and it is night, during which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.

21. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.

22. The sun arises; they get away, and lie down in their dens.

23. Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.

24. O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom have thou made them all. The earth is full of thy riches.

25. Yonder is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable creeping things, both small and great beasts.

26. There go the ships. There is leviathan, whom thou have formed to play in it.

27. These all wait for thee, that thou may give them their food in due season.

28. Thou give to them, they gather. Thou open thy hand, they are satisfied with good.

29. Thou hide thy face, they are troubled. Thou take away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

30. Thou send forth thy Spirit, they are created, and thou renew the face of the ground.

31. Let the glory of Jehovah endure forever. Let Jehovah rejoice in his works,

32. who looks on the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.

33. I will sing to Jehovah as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.

34. Let thy meditation be sweet to him. I will rejoice in Jehovah.

35. Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.

## Psalms 105

1. O give thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name. Make known among the peoples his doings.

2. Sing to him, sing praises to him. Talk ye of all his marvelous works.

3. Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.

4. Seek ye Jehovah and his strength. Seek his face evermore.

5. Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

6. O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye sons of Jacob, his chosen.

7. He is Jehovah our God. His judgments are in all the earth.

8. He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

9. which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac,

10. and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

11. saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,

12. when they were but a few men in number, yea, very few, and sojourners in it.

13. And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.

14. He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,

15. saying, Touch not my anointed men, and do my prophets no harm.

16. And he called for a famine upon the land. He broke the whole staff of bread.

17. He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a servant.

18. They hurt his feet with fetters. He was placed in iron.

19. Until the time that his word came to pass, the word of Jehovah tried him.

20. The king sent and released him, even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.

21. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance,

22. to bind his rulers at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.

23. Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24. And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.

25. He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.

26. He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.

27. They set among them his signs and wonders in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness, and made it dark. And they rebelled against his words.

29. He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.

30. Their land swarmed with frogs in the chambers of their kings.

31. He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and lice in all their borders.

32. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

33. He also smote their vines and their fig trees, and broke the trees of their borders.

34. He spoke, and the locust came, and the grasshopper, and that without number,

35. and ate up every herb in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.

36. He also smote all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.

37. And he brought them forth with silver and gold, and there was not a feeble soul among his tribes.

38. Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen upon them.

39. He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night.

40. They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

41. He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran in the dry places like a river.

42. For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham his servant.

43. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with singing.

44. And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labor of the peoples in possession,

45. that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.

## Psalms 106

1. Praise ye Jehovah. O give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good, for his loving kindness is forever.

2. Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, or show forth all his praise?

3. Blessed are those who keep justice, and he who does righteousness at all times.

4. Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bear to thy people. O visit me with thy salvation,

5. that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.

6. We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. we have done wickedly.

7. Our fathers did not understand thy wonders in Egypt. They did not remember the multitude of thy loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

8. Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

9. He also rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up. So he led them through the depths as through a wilderness.

10. And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

11. And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.

12. Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.

13. They soon forgot his works. They did not wait for his counsel,

14. but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and challenged God in the desert.

15. And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.

16. They also envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the sanctified of Jehovah.

17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

18. And a fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked men.

19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.

20. Thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eats grass.

21. They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,

22. wondrous works in the land of Ham, and fearful things by the Red Sea.

23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy.

24. Yea, they despised the pleasant land. They did not believe his word,

25. but murmured in their tents, and did not hearken to the voice of Jehovah.

26. Therefore he swore to them, that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,

27. and that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.

28. They also joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.

30. Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, and so the plague was stayed.

31. And that was reckoned to him for righteousness to all generations for evermore.

32. They also angered him at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses because of them,

33. because they were rebellious against his spirit, and he spoke ill-advisedly with his lips.

34. They did not destroy the peoples, as Jehovah commanded them,

35. but mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works,

36. and served their idols, which became a snare to them.

37. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,

38. and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. And the land was polluted with blood.

39. Thus they were defiled with their works, and played the harlot in their doings.

40. Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.

41. And he gave them into the hand of the nations. And those who hated them ruled over them.

42. Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

43. Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.

44. Nevertheless he regarded their distress when he heard their cry.

45. And he remembered his covenant for them, and relented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.

46. He also made them to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.

47. Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.

48. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Truly. Praise ye Jehovah.

## Psalms 107

1. O give thanks to Jehovah, For he is good, for his loving kindness is forever.

2. Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,

3. and gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.

4. They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city of habitation.

5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

6. Then they cried to Jehovah in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.

7. He also led them by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation.

8. O that men would praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

9. For he satisfies the longing soul, and he fills the hungry soul with good,

10. even those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,

11. because they rebelled against the words of God, and scorned the counsel of the Most High.

12. Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was none to help.

13. Then they cried to Jehovah in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.

14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds apart.

15. O that men would praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

16. For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron apart.

17. Fools are afflicted because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities.

18. Their soul abhors all manner of food, and they draw near to the gates of death.

19. Then they cry to Jehovah in their trouble, and he saves them out of their distresses.

20. He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them from their destructions.

21. O that men would praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

22. And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing.

23. Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters,

24. these men see the works of Jehovah, and his wonders in the deep.

25. For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves of it.

26. They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.

27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.

28. Then they cry to Jehovah in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses.

29. He makes the storm a calm, so that the waves of it are still.

30. Then they are glad because they are quiet, so he brings them to their desired haven.

31. O that men would praise Jehovah for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

32. Let them also exalt him in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.

33. He turns rivers into a wilderness, and water springs into a thirsty ground,

34. a fruitful land into a salt desert, for the wickedness of those who dwell therein.

35. He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.

36. And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city of habitation,

37. and sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get fruits of increase.

38. He also blesses them, so that they are multiplied greatly, and he does not allow their cattle to decrease.

39. Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.

40. He pours contempt upon rulers, and causes them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.

41. Yet he sets a needy man on high from affliction, and makes him families like a flock.

42. The upright shall see it, and be glad. And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

43. He who is wise will give heed to these things, and they will consider the loving kindnesses of Jehovah.

## Psalms 108

1. My heart is fixed, O God, I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.

2. Awake, psaltery and harp. I myself will awake right early.

3. I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples, and I will sing praises to thee among the nations.

4. For thy loving kindness is great above the heavens, and thy truth is to the skies.

5. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.

6. That thy beloved may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and answer us.

7. God has spoken in his holiness. I will exult. I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

8. Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.

9. Moab is my wash pot. Upon Edom I will cast my shoe. Over Philistia I will shout.

10. Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom?

11. Have thou not cast us off, O God? And thou go not forth, O God, with our armies.

12. Give us help against the adversary, for vain is the help of man.

13. Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is who will tread down our adversaries.

## Psalms 109

1. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise,

2. for they have opened against me the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit. They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.

3. They have also encompassed me about with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.

4. For my love they are my adversaries, but I make prayer.

5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

6. Set thou a wicked man over him, and let an adversary stand at his right hand.

7. When he is judged, let him come forth guilty, and let his prayer be turned into sin.

8. Let his days be few, and let another take his office.

9. Let his sons be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

10. Let his sons be vagabonds, and beg, and let them seek out of their desolate places.

11. Let a creditor exact all that he has, and let strangers make spoil of his labor.

12. Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor let there be any to have pity on his fatherless sons.

13. Let his posterity be cut off. In the generation following let their name be blotted out.

14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

15. Let them be before Jehovah continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth,

16. because he did not remember to show kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the broken in heart, to kill.

17. Yea, he loved cursing, and it came to him. And he did not delight in blessing, and it was far from him.

18. He also clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, and it came into his inward parts like water, and like oil into his bones.

19. Let it be to him as the raiment with which he covers himself, and for the belt with which he is girded continually.

20. This is the reward of my adversaries from Jehovah, and of those who speak evil against my soul.

21. But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name's sake. Because thy loving kindness is good, deliver thou me,

22. for I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

23. I am gone like the shadow when it declines. I am tossed up and down as the locust.

24. My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh fails of fatness.

25. I also have become a reproach to them. When they see me, they shake their head.

26. Help me, O Jehovah my God. O save me according to thy loving kindness,

27. that they may know that this is thy hand, that thou, Jehovah, have done it.

28. Let them curse, but bless thou. When they arise, they shall be put to shame, but thy servant shall rejoice.

29. Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor, and let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.

30. I will give great thanks to Jehovah with my mouth. Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

31. For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who judge his soul.

## Psalms 110

1. Jehovah says to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.

5. The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.

5. It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends. He shall maintain his cause in judgment,

6. for he shall never be moved. A righteous man shall be had in everlasting remembrance.

7. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings. His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.

8. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, even until he looks over his adversaries.

9. He has scattered, he has given to the poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn shall be exalted with honor.

10. A wicked man shall see it, and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. The desire of wicked men shall perish.

4. Jehovah is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.

5. Who is like Jehovah our God who has his seat on high,

6. and yet looks upon the low things in heaven and in the earth.

7. He raises up a poor man out of the dust, and lifts up a needy man from the dunghill,

8. that he may set him with rulers, even with the rulers of his people.

9. He makes the barren woman to keep house, a joyful mother of sons. Praise ye Jehovah.

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,

2. Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.

3. The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back.

4. The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.

5. What ails thee, O thou sea, that thou flee? Thou Jordan, that thou turn back?

6. Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams, ye little hills, like lambs?

7. Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

8. who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

## Psalms 115

1. Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, but to thy name give glory. For thy loving kindness, and for thy truth's sake.

## Psalms 122

1. I was glad when they said to me, Let us go to the house of Jehovah.

2. Our feet are standing inside thy gates, O Jerusalem.

3. Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together,

4. where the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah, for an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Jehovah.

5. For there thrones are set for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. They shall prosper who love thee.

7. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

8. For my brothers and companions' sakes I will now say, Peace be within thee.

9. For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good.

## Psalms 123

1. To thee do I lift up my eyes, O thou who sit in the heavens.

2. Behold, as the eyes of servants to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are to Jehovah our God, until he has mercy upon us.

3. Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us, for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.

4. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

## Psalms 124

1. If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, let Israel now say,

2. if it had not been Jehovah who was on our side when men rose up against us,

3. then they would have swallowed us up alive when their wrath was kindled against us,

4. then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul,

5. then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.

6. Blessed be Jehovah, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.

7. Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.

8. Our help is in the name of Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.

## Psalms 125

1. Those who trust in Jehovah are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.

2. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Jehovah is round about his people from this time forth and for evermore.

3. For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, that the righteous not put forth their hands to iniquity.

4. Do good, O Jehovah, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts.

5. But as for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.

## Psalms 126

1. When Jehovah brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream.

2. Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, Jehovah has done great things for them.

3. Jehovah has done great things for us. We are glad.

4. Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, as the streams in the South.

5. Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy.

6. He who goes forth and weeps, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves.

## Psalms 127

1. Unless Jehovah builds the house, they labor in vain who build it. Unless Jehovah guards the city, the watchman wake but in vain.

2. It is vain for you to rise up early, to take rest late, to eat the bread of toil, for so he gives sleep to his beloved.

3. Lo, sons are a heritage of Jehovah, and the fruit of the womb is a reward.

4. As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth.

5. Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

## Psalms 128

1. Blessed are all who fear Jehovah, who walk in his ways.

2. For thou shall eat the labor of thy hands. Happy thou shall be, and it shall be well with thee.

3. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of thy house, thy sons like olive plants round about thy table.

4. Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears Jehovah.

5. Jehovah bless thee out of Zion, and see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

6. Yea, see thou thy son's sons. Peace be upon Israel.

## Psalms 129

1. Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say,

2. Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.

3. The plowers plowed upon my back. They made long their furrows.

4. Jehovah is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.

5. Let them be put to shame and turned backward, all those who hate Zion.

6. Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withers before it grows up,

7. with which the reaper fills not his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.

8. Neither do those who go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you. We bless you in the name of Jehovah.

## Psalms 130

1. Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Jehovah.

2. Lord, hear my voice. Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.

3. If thou, Jehovah, should note iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?

4. But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou may be feared.

5. I wait for Jehovah. My soul waits, and in his word do I hope,

6. my soul for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, watchmen for the morning.

7. O Israel, hope in Jehovah, for with Jehovah there is loving kindness, and with him is plentiful redemption.

8. And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

## Psalms 131

1. Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty. Neither do I exercise myself in grand matters, or in things too wonderful for me.

2. Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with his mother. Like a weaned child is my soul within me.

3. O Israel, hope in Jehovah from this time forth and for evermore.

## Psalms 132

1. Jehovah, remember for David all his affliction,

2. how he swore to Jehovah, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed,

4. I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,

5. until I find out a place for Jehovah, a tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.

6. Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of the wood.

7. We will go into his tabernacles. We will worship at his footstool.

8. Arise, O Jehovah, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength.

9. Let thy priest be clothed with righteousness, and let thy sanctified shout for joy.

10. For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.

11. Jehovah has sworn to David in truth. He will not turn from it: From the fruit of thy body I will set upon thy throne.

12. If thy sons will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their sons also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.

13. For Jehovah has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation.

14. This is my resting place forever. Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.

15. I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.

16. I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her sanctified shall shout aloud for joy.

17. There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.

18. I will clothe his enemies with shame, but upon himself his crown shall flourish.

## Psalms 133

1. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!

2. It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that came down upon the skirt of his garments,

3. like the dew of Hermon, that comes down upon the mountains of Zion. For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.

## Psalms 134

1. Behold, bless ye Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, who stand by night in the house of Jehovah.

2. Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, and bless ye Jehovah.

3. Jehovah bless thee out of Zion, even he who made heaven and earth.

## Psalms 135

1. Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah,

2. ye who stand in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of the house of our God.

3. Praise ye Jehovah, for Jehovah is good. Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant.

4. For Jehovah has chosen Jacob to himself, Israel for his own possession.

5. For I know that Jehovah is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.

6. Whatever Jehovah pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps,

7. who causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth, who makes lightnings for the rain, who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries,

8. who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast,

9. who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants,

10. who smote many nations, and killed mighty kings-

11. Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan-

12. and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel his people.

13. Thy name, O Jehovah, is forever, thy memorial, O Jehovah, throughout all generations.

14. For Jehovah will judge his people, and will relent concerning his servants.

15. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

16. They have mouths, but they speak not. They have eyes, but they see not.

17. They have ears, but they hear not, nor is there any breath in their mouths.

18. Those who make them shall be like them, yea, everyone who trusts in them.

19. O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah. O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah.

20. O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah. Ye who fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.

21. Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.

7. to him who made great lights, for his loving kindness is forever,

8. the sun to rule by day, for his loving kindness is forever,

9. the moon and stars to rule by night, for his loving kindness is forever,

10. to him who smote Egypt in their firstborn, for his loving kindness is forever,

11. and brought out Israel from among them, for his loving kindness is forever,

12. with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, for his loving kindness is forever,

13. to him who divided the Red Sea apart, for his loving kindness is forever,

14. and made Israel to pass through the midst of it, for his loving kindness is forever,

15. but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, for his loving kindness is forever,

16. to him who led his people through the wilderness, for his loving kindness is forever,

17. to him who smote great kings, for his loving kindness is forever,

22. even a heritage to Israel his servant, for his loving kindness is forever,

23. who remembered us in our low estate, for his loving kindness is forever,

24. and has delivered us from our adversaries, for his loving kindness is forever,

25. who gives food to all flesh, for his loving kindness is forever.

26. O give thanks to the God of heaven, for his loving kindness is forever.

## Psalms 137

1. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.

2. Upon the willows in the midst of it we hung up our harps.

3. For there those who led us captive required of us songs, and those who wasted us, mirth, saying, Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.

4. How shall we sing Jehovah's song in a foreign land?

5. If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget.

6. Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember thee, if I do not prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.

7. Remember, O Jehovah, the day of Jerusalem against the sons of Edom, who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.

8. O daughter of Babylon, who is to be destroyed, happy shall he be who rewards thee as thou have served us.

9. Happy shall he be who takes and dashes thy little ones against the rock.

## Psalms 138

1. I will give thee thanks with my whole heart. I will sing praises to thee before the gods.

2. I will worship toward thy holy temple, and give thanks to thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth. For thou have magnified thy word above all thy name.

3. Thou answered me in the day that I called. Thou encouraged me with strength in my soul.

4. All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O Jehovah, for they have heard the words of thy mouth.

5. Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah, for great is the glory of Jehovah.

6. For though Jehovah is high, yet he has respect to the lowly. But he knows the haughty from afar.

7. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou will revive me. Thou will stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand will save me.

8. Jehovah will perfect that which concerns me. Thy loving kindness, O Jehovah, is forever. Forsake not the works of thine own hands.

## Psalms 139

1. O Jehovah, thou have searched me, and known.

2. Thou know my sitting down and my rising up. Thou understand my thought afar off.

3. Thou search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.

4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Jehovah, thou know it altogether.

5. Thou have beset me behind and before, and laid thy hand upon me.

6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high, I cannot attain to it.

7. Where shall I go from thy Spirit? Or where shall I flee from thy presence?

8. If I ascend up into heaven, thou are there. If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou are there.

9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the outermost parts of the sea,

10. even there thy hand shall lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, and the light around me shall be night,

12. even the darkness hides not from thee, but the night shines as the day. The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

13. For thou formed my inward parts. Thou covered me in my mother's womb.

14. I will give thanks to thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are thy works, and that my soul knows right well.

15. My frame was not hidden from thee, when I was made in secret, curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

16. Thine eyes saw my unformed substance, and in thy book they were all written, even the days that were ordained, when as yet there was none of them.

17. How precious also are thy thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!

18. I count them; they are more in number than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee.

19. Surely thou will kill the wicked, O God. Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.

20. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take it in vain.

21. Do I not hate them, O Jehovah, who hate thee? And am I not grieved with those who rise up against thee?

22. I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies.

23. Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts,

24. and see if there is any wicked way in me. And lead me in the way everlasting.

## Psalms 140

1. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man. Preserve me from the violent man,

2. and men who devise mischievous things in their heart. They gather themselves continually together for war.

3. They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent. Adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.

4. Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of a wicked man. Preserve me from violent men, who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.

5. The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords. They have spread a net by the wayside. They have set snares for me. Selah.

6. I said to Jehovah, Thou are my God. Give ear to the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.

7. O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou have covered my head in the day of battle.

8. Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked man. Do not further his evil device. They exalt themselves. Selah.

9. As for the head of those who encompass me around, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

10. Let burning coals fall upon them. Let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, from where they shall not rise.

11. An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth. Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

12. I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted man, and justice for the needy.

13. Surely the righteous shall give thanks to thy name. The upright shall dwell in thy presence.

## Psalms 141

1. Jehovah, I have called upon thee. Make haste to me. Give ear to my voice when I call to thee.

2. Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

3. Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth. Keep the door of my lips.

4. Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. And let me not eat of their dainties.

5. Let a righteous man smite me, as a kindness. And let him reprove me, as oil upon the head. Let not my head refuse it. For even in their wickedness my prayer shall continue.

6. Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. And they shall hear my words, for they are sweet.

7. Like plowing and furrowing the earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

8. For my eyes are to thee, O Jehovah the Lord. In thee do I take refuge. Leave not my soul destitute.

9. Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the traps of the workers of iniquity.

10. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass over.

## Psalms 142

1. I cry with my voice to Jehovah. With my voice to Jehovah I make supplication.

2. I pour out my complaint before him. I show my trouble before him.

3. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, thou knew my path. In the way in which I walk they have hidden a snare for me.

4. Look on my right hand, and see, for there is no man who knows me. Refuge has failed me. No man cares for my soul.

5. I cried to thee, O Jehovah. I said, Thou are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.

6. Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.

7. Bring my soul out of prison that I may give thanks to thy name. The righteous shall encompass me around, for thou will deal bountifully with me.

## Psalms 143

1. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah. Give ear to my supplications. In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

2. And enter not into judgment with thy servant. For in thy sight no man living is righteous.

3. For the enemy has persecuted my soul. He has smitten my life down to the ground. He has made me to dwell in dark places as those who have been long dead.

4. Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.

5. I remember the days of old. I meditate on all thy doings. I muse on the work of thy hands.

6. I spread forth my hands to thee. My soul is as a weary land for thee. Selah.

7. Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah, my spirit fails. Hide not thy face from me, lest I become like those who go down into the pit.

8. Cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning, for in thee do I trust. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to thee.

9. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from my enemies. I flee to thee to hide me.

10. Teach me to do thy will, for thou are my God. Thy Spirit is good, lead me in the land of uprightness.

11. Revive me, O Jehovah, for thy name's sake. In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.

12. And in thy loving kindness cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am thy servant.

## Psalms 144

1. Blessed be Jehovah, my rock, who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight,

2. my loving kindness, and my fortress, my high tower, and my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me.

3. Jehovah, what is man, that thou take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou make account of him?

4. Man is like vanity. His days are as a shadow that passes away.

5. Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

6. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them. Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.

7. Stretch forth thy hand from above. Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of aliens,

8. whose mouth speaks deceit, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

9. I will sing a new song to thee, O God. Upon a psaltery of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.

10. Thou are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David his servant from the hurtful sword.

11. Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, whose mouth speaks deceit, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

12. That our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, and our daughters as cornerstones hewn according to the fashion of a palace,

13. our garners are full, affording all manner of store, our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields,

14. our oxen are well laden, no breaking in, and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets,

15. blessed are the people who are in such a case. Blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah.

## Psalms 145

1. I will extol thee, my God, O King, and I will bless thy name forever and ever.

12. to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.

13. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion is throughout all generations.

14. Jehovah upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who are bowed down.

15. The eyes of all wait for thee, and thou give them their food in due season.

16. Thou open thy hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

17. Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.

18. Jehovah is near to all those who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth.

2. While I live I will praise Jehovah. I will sing praises to my God while I have any being.

3. Put not your trust in rulers, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.

4. His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth. In that very day his thoughts perish.

5. Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God,

6. who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps truth forever,

7. who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. Jehovah releases the prisoners.

8. Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind. Jehovah raises up those who are bowed down. Jehovah loves the righteous.
