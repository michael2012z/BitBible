# Exodus

## Exodus 1

1. Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt (every man and his household who came with Jacob):

2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

3. Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

4. Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.

5. And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls. And Joseph was in Egypt already.

6. And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.

7. And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty, and the land was filled with them.

8. Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.

9. And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.

10. Come, let us deal craftily with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when war happens, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.

11. Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.

12. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.

13. And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with rigor.

14. And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, with which they made them serve with rigor.

15. And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.

16. And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him, but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

17. But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.

18. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?

19. And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women, for they are lively, and are delivered before the midwife comes to them.

20. And God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.

21. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.

22. And Pharaoh ordered all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

## Exodus 2

1. And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.

2. And the woman conceived, and bore a son. And when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

3. And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch. And she put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's edge.

4. And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.

5. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along by the riverside. And she saw the ark among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.

6. And she opened it, and saw the child, and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.

7. Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse for thee from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?

8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother.

9. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.

10. And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.

11. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brothers.

12. And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

13. And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together. And he said to him who did the wrong, Why do thou smite thy neighbor?

14. And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Do thou think to kill me, as thou killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.

15. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.

16. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

17. And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

18. And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye have come so soon today?

19. And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.

20. And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.

21. And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.

22. And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.

23. And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.

24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

25. And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge of them.

## Exodus 3

1. Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.

2. And the agent of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

3. And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

4. And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am.

5. And he said, Do not draw near here. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place on which thou stand is holy ground.

6. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

7. And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.

8. And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

9. And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.

10. Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou may bring forth my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.

11. And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?

12. And he said, I will certainly be with thee. And this shall be the sign to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou have brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

13. And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the sons of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them?

14. And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And he said, Thus shall thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.

15. And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall thou say to the sons of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.

16. Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.

17. And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.

18. And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shall come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. And now let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.

19. And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.

20. And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it, and after that he will let you go.

21. And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

22. But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. And ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters, and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.

## Exodus 4

1. And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice, for they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to thee.

2. And Jehovah said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.

3. And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground. And it became a serpent, and Moses fled from before it.

4. And Jehovah said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand),

5. that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to thee.

6. And Jehovah said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom. And when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as snow.

7. And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.)

8. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

9. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, nor hearken to thy voice, that thou shall take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land. And the water which thou take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

10. And Moses said to Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou have spoken to thy servant, for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

11. And Jehovah said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes a man dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?

12. Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shall speak.

13. And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou will send.

14. And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet thee, and when he sees thee, he will be glad in his heart.

15. And thou shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do,

16. and he shall be thy spokesman to the people. And it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shall be to him as God.

17. And thou shall take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shall do the signs.

18. And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

19. And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt, for all the men are dead who sought thy life.

20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

21. And Jehovah said to Moses, When thou go back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.

22. And thou shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, Israel is my son, my firstborn,

23. and I have said to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay thy son, thy firstborn.

24. And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him.

25. Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet. And she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood thou are to me.

26. So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood thou are, because of the circumcision.

27. And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him.

28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had ordered him.

29. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.

30. And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

31. And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.

## Exodus 5

1. And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.

2. And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken to his voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.

3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

4. And the king of Egypt said to them, Therefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? Get you to your burdens.

5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.

6. And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,

7. Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as formerly. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.

8. And the number of the bricks, which they made formerly, ye shall lay upon them. Ye shall not diminish any of it. For they are idle, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

9. Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard lying words.

10. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

11. Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it, for none of your work shall be diminished.

12. So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.

13. And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

14. And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and today, in making brick as formerly?

15. Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do thou deal thus with thy servants?

16. There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick. And, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault it in thine own people.

17. But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle. Therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.

18. Go therefore now, and work, for there shall no straw be given you, yet ye shall deliver the number of bricks.

19. And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in affliction, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, your daily tasks.

20. And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh,

21. and they said to them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge, because ye have made our fragrance to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

22. And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Lord, why have thou dealt ill with this people? Why is it that thou have sent me?

23. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has dealt ill with this people, neither have thou delivered thy people at all.

## Exodus 6

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Now thou shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.

2. And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Jehovah.

3. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but I was not known by them by my name Jehovah.

4. And I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojourning, in which they sojourned.

5. And moreover I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.

6. Therefore say to the sons of Israel, I am Jehovah. And I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments.

7. And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

8. And I will bring you in to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you for a heritage. I am Jehovah.

9. And Moses spoke so to the sons of Israel, but they did not hearken to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

10. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

11. Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.

12. And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the sons of Israel have not hearkened to me, how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

13. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them an order to the sons of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

14. These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi, these are the families of Reuben.

15. And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman, these are the families of Simeon.

16. And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty-seven years.

17. The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.

18. And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty-three years.

19. And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.

20. And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years.

21. And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

22. And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.

23. And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

24. And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites.

25. And Eleazar Aaron's son took to him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife, and she bore to him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

26. These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

27. These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron.

28. And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,

29. that Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah. Speak thou to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to thee.

30. And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken to me?

## Exodus 7

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

2. Thou shall speak all that I command thee, and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.

3. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

4. But Pharaoh will not hearken to you. And I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

5. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the sons of Israel from among them.

6. And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded them, so they did.

7. And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.

8. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

9. When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a wonder for you, then thou shall say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.

10. And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh. And they did so, as Jehovah had commanded, and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

11. Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. And they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.

12. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents, but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

13. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.

14. And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.

15. Get thee to Pharaoh in the morning, lo, he goes out to the water, and thou shall stand by the river's edge to meet him, and the rod which was turned to a serpent thou shall take in thy hand.

16. And thou shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. And, behold, until now thou have not hearkened.

17. Thus says Jehovah, In this thou shall know that I am Jehovah. Behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

18. And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul, and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.

19. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.

20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded. And he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants, and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

21. And the fish that were in the river died, and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river. And the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.

22. And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.

23. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.

24. And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river.

25. And seven days were fulfilled, after Jehovah had smitten the river.

## Exodus 8

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

2. And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.

3. And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs.

4. And the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.

5. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

6. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

7. And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

8. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people, and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.

9. And Moses said to Pharaoh, Have this honor over me: When shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?

10. And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word, that thou may know that there is none like Jehovah our God.

11. And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people, they shall remain in the river only.

12. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried to Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.

13. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.

14. And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.

15. But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart, and did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.

16. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

17. And they did so. And Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth. And there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

18. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. And there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

19. Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken.

20. And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh. Lo, he comes forth to the water. And say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

21. Else, if thou will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they are.

22. And in that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, to the end thou may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.

23. And I will put a division between my people and thy people. This sign shall be by tomorrow.

24. And Jehovah did so, and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses. And in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted because of the swarms of flies.

25. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.

26. And Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

27. We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.

28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness, only ye shall not go very far away. Entreat for me.

29. And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.

30. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.

31. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

32. And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.

## Exodus 9

1. Then Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

2. For if thou refuse to let them go, and will still hold them,

3. behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks-a very grievous pestilence.

4. And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel.

5. And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.

6. And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died, but of the cattle of the sons of Israel not one died.

7. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.

8. And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

9. And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with sores upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

10. And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven, and it became a boil breaking forth with sores upon man and upon beast.

11. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

12. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not hearken to them, as Jehovah had spoken to Moses.

13. And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

14. For this time I will send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, that thou may know that there is none like me in all the earth.

15. For now I have put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou have been cut off from the earth.

16. But indeed for this cause I have raised thee up, to display in thee my power, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.

17. As yet thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou will not let them go?

18. Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.

19. Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou have in the field, for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

20. He who feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.

21. And he who did not regard the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.

22. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.

23. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven, and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth, and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

24. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

25. And throughout all the land of Egypt the hail smote all that was in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.

26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, was there no hail.

27. And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.

28. Entreat Jehovah, for there has been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail, and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.

29. And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to Jehovah. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail, that thou may know that the earth is Jehovah's.

30. But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.

31. And the flax and the barley were smitten, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.

32. But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.

33. And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to Jehovah, and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.

34. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

35. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.

## Exodus 10

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,

2. and that thou may tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them, that ye may know that I am Jehovah.

3. And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long will thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.

4. Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into thy border.

5. And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no man is able to see the ground. And they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.

6. And thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.

7. And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do thou not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?

8. And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God, but who are those who shall go?

9. And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go, for we must hold a feast to Jehovah.

10. And he said to them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones. Look, evil is before you.

11. Not so. Go ye now who are men, and serve Jehovah, for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

12. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.

13. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night, and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

14. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt, very grievous were they, before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

15. For they covered the face of the whole ground, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. And there remained not any green thing, either tree nor herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

16. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.

17. Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may only take away from me this death.

18. And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.

19. And Jehovah turned an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.

20. But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.

21. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.

22. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days,

23. they did not see each other, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.

24. And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah, only let your flocks and your herds stay. Let your little ones also go with you.

25. And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.

26. Our cattle shall also go with us, there shall not a hoof be left behind, for we must take of it to serve Jehovah our God, and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come there.

27. But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

28. And Pharaoh said to him, Get thee from me. Take heed to thyself, see my face no more, for in the day thou see my face thou shall die.

29. And Moses said, Thou have spoken well. I will see thy face again no more.

## Exodus 11

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Yet one plague more I will bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt, afterwards he will let you go from here. When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out from here altogether.

2. Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.

3. And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

4. And Moses said, Thus says Jehovah, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,

5. and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits upon his throne, even to the firstborn of the maid-servant that is behind the mill, and all the firstborn of cattle.

6. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.

7. But against any of the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast, that ye may know how that Jehovah makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.

8. And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and bow themselves down to me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people who follow thee. And after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.

9. And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh. And Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.

## Exodus 12

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

2. This month shall be to you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.

3. Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household.

4. And if the household be too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls, according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.

5. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. Ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats.

6. And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.

7. And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel upon the houses in which they shall eat it.

8. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread, with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

9. Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with the inwards of it.

10. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, but that which remains of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

11. And thus ye shall eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And ye shall eat it in haste. It is Jehovah's Passover.

12. For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments. I am Jehovah.

13. And the blood shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

14. And this day shall be to you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.

15. Seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread, even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

16. And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation, no manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.

17. And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread, for in this selfsame day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore ye shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.

18. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.

19. Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one who is born in the land.

20. Ye shall eat nothing leavened, in all your habitations ye shall eat unleavened bread.

21. Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take to you lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.

22. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin, and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.

23. For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.

24. And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever.

25. And it shall come to pass, when ye have come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he has promised, that ye shall keep this service.

26. And it shall come to pass, when your sons shall say to you, What do ye mean by this service?

27. that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah's Passover, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.

28. And the sons of Israel went and did so, as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

29. And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.

30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

31. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.

32. Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone, and bless me also.

33. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, We are all dead men.

34. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

35. And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses, and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.

36. And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.

37. And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.

38. And a mixed multitude also went up with them, and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.

39. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions.

40. Now the time that the sons of Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan was four hundred and thirty years.

41. And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.

42. It is a night to be much observed to Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.

43. And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover. There shall no foreigner eat of it,

44. but every man's servant who is bought for money, when thou have circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.

45. A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.

46. In one house it shall be eaten. Thou shall not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house, neither shall ye break a bone of it.

47. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

48. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the Passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it, and he shall be as one who is born in the land, but no uncircumcised man shall eat of it.

49. One law shall be to him who is home-born, and to the stranger who sojourns among you.

50. Thus did all the sons of Israel, as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

51. And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

## Exodus 13

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the sons of Israel. Both of man and of beast, it is mine.

3. And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place. There shall no leavened bread be eaten.

4. This day ye go forth in the month Abib.

5. And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shall keep this service in this month.

6. Seven days thou shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah.

7. Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days, and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders.

8. And thou shall tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.

9. And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth, for with a strong hand has Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.

10. Thou shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.

11. And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,

12. that thou shall set apart to Jehovah all that opens the womb. And every firstling which thou have that comes of a beast, the males shall be Jehovah's.

13. And every firstling of a donkey thou shall redeem with a lamb, and if thou will not redeem it, then thou shall break its neck. And all the firstborn of man among thy sons thou shall redeem.

14. And it shall be, when thy son asks thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shall say to him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.

15. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that opens the womb, being males, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.

16. And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes, for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.

17. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, Lest perhaps the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.

18. But God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea. And the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.

19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had strictly sworn the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones away from here with you.

20. And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

21. And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night.

22. The pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night departed not from before the people.

## Exodus 14

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon. Ye shall encamp opposite it by the sea.

3. And Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.

4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them, and I will get for me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.

5. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled. And the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?

6. And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him.

7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.

8. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel, for the sons of Israel went out with a high hand.

9. And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

10. And when Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they were very afraid. And the sons of Israel cried out to Jehovah,

11. and they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?

12. Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

13. And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not. Stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you today, for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.

14. Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall keep silent.

15. And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do thou cry to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, that they go forward.

16. And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.

17. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them, and I will get for me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

18. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten for me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

19. And the agent of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.

20. And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And the cloud and the darkness was there, yet it gave light by night. And the one did not come near the other all the night.

21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

22. And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.

23. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

24. And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and troubled the army of the Egyptians.

25. And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them with difficulty, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for Jehovah fights for them against the Egyptians.

26. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared, and the Egyptians fled against it, and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

28. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh who went in after them into the sea, there remained not so much as one of them.

29. But the sons of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.

30. Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.

31. And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians. And the people feared Jehovah, and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses.

## Exodus 15

1. Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to Jehovah, and spoke, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.

2. Jehovah is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him.

3. Jehovah is a man of war. Jehovah is his name.

4. Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has cast into the sea, and his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.

5. The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.

6. Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power. Thy right hand, O Jehovah, dashes the enemy in pieces.

7. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrow those who rise up against thee. Thou send forth thy wrath, it consumes them as stubble.

8. And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up. The floods stood up as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.

9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my desire shall be satisfied upon them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

10. Thou did blow with thy wind, the sea covered them. They sank as lead in the mighty waters.

11. Who is like thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

12. Thou stretched out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

13. Thou in thy loving kindness have led the people that thou have redeemed. Thou have guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.

14. The peoples have heard, they tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.

15. Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed, the mighty men of Moab. Trembling takes hold upon them. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.

16. Terror and dread falls upon them. By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone, till thy people pass over, O Jehovah, till the people pass over whom thou have purchased.

17. Thou will bring them in, and plant them on the mountain of thine inheritance, the place, O Jehovah, which thou have made for thee to dwell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

18. Jehovah shall reign forever and ever.

19. For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.

20. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

21. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.

22. And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

23. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.

24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

25. And he cried to Jehovah. And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

26. and he said, If thou will diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians, for I am Jehovah who heals thee.

27. And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there by the waters.

## Exodus 16

1. And they took their journey from Elim. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

2. And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.

3. And the sons of Israel said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full, for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

4. Then Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.

5. And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.

6. And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt,

7. and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah, for he hears your murmurings against Jehovah. And what are we, that ye murmur against us?

8. And Moses said, This shall be when Jehovah shall give you flesh to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning, for that Jehovah hears your murmurings which ye murmur against him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.

9. And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for he has heard your murmurings.

10. And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.

11. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

12. I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.

13. And it came to pass at evening, that the quails came up, and covered the camp. And in the morning the dew lay round about the camp,

14. and when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoarfrost on the ground.

15. And when the sons of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.

16. This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating, an omer a head. According to the number of your persons, ye shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.

17. And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.

18. And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.

19. And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

20. Notwithstanding they did not hearken to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul, and Moses was angry with them.

21. And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating. And when the sun grew hot, it melted.

22. And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

23. And he said to them, This is that which Jehovah has spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath to Jehovah. Bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil, and all that remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

24. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade, and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm in it.

25. And Moses said, Eat that today, for today is a sabbath to Jehovah. Today ye shall not find it in the field.

26. Six days ye shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the sabbath, there shall be none in it.

27. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.

28. And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?

29. See, because Jehovah has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Abide ye every man in his place. Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

30. So the people rested on the seventh day.

31. And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna. And it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers with honey.

32. And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded. Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

33. And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.

34. As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

35. And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.

36. Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

## Exodus 17

1. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim. And there was no water for the people to drink.

2. Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do ye contend with me? Why do ye challenge Jehovah?

3. And the people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why have thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?

4. And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? They are almost ready to stone me.

5. And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee from the elders of Israel, and thy rod, with which thou smote the river, take in thy hand, and go.

6. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb, and thou shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

7. And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the contending of the sons of Israel, and because they challenged Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?

8. Then Amalek came, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

9. And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.

10. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

12. But Moses' hands were heavy. And they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

13. And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

14. And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi.

16. And he said, Jehovah has sworn, Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

## Exodus 18

1. Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.

2. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,

3. and her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.

4. And the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.

5. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God.

6. And he said to Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

7. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.

8. And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.

9. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.

10. And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

11. Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods, yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.

12. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.

13. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning to the evening.

14. And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou do to the people? Why do thou sit by thyself, and all the people stand about thee from morning to evening?

15. And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.

16. When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor. And I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

17. And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou do is not good.

18. Thou will surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee, for the thing is too heavy for thee. Thou are not able to perform it thyself alone.

19. Hearken now to my voice. I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee. Be thou for the people toward God, and bring thou the cases to God.

20. And thou shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.

21. Moreover thou shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain, and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens,

22. and let them judge the people at all seasons. And it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

23. If thou shall do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shall be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.

24. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.

25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens,

26. and they judged the people at all seasons. The hard cases they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

27. And Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.

## Exodus 19

1. In the third month after the sons of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.

2. And when they were departed from Rephidim, and came to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness, and there Israel encamped before the mount.

3. And Moses went up to God. And Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus thou shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel:

4. Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.

5. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be my own possession from among all peoples, for all the earth is mine,

6. and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shall speak to the sons of Israel.

7. And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.

8. And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah.

9. And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee forever. And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah.

10. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,

11. and be ready for the third day, for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

12. And thou shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye not go up onto the mount, or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death;

13. no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through, whether it be beast or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.

14. And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.

15. And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Come not near a woman.

16. And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of an exceedingly loud trumpet. And all the people who were in the camp trembled.

17. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the lower part of the mount.

18. And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire, and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace. And the whole mount quaked greatly.

19. And when the voice of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.

20. And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount. And Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.

21. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, command the people, lest they break through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.

22. And let the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.

23. And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai, for thou commanded us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.

24. And Jehovah said to him, Go, get thee down. And thou shall come up, thou, and Aaron with thee, but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.

25. So Moses went down to the people, and told them.

## Exodus 20

1. And God spoke all these words, saying,

2. I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3. Thou shall have no other gods before me.

4. Thou shall not make to thee a graven image, nor any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5. Thou shall not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them, for I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me,

6. and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.

7. Thou shall not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

8. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9. Six days thou shall labor, and do all thy work,

10. but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah thy God. Thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates,

11. for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God gives thee.

13. Thou shall not murder.

14. Thou shall not commit adultery.

15. Thou shall not steal.

16. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

17. Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's house. Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.

18. And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. And when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.

19. And they said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

20. And Moses said to the people, Fear not, for God has come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye not sin.

21. And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.

22. And Jehovah said to Moses, Thus thou shall say to the sons of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

23. Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make to you.

24. An altar of earth thou shall make to me, and shall sacrifice on it thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen. In every place where I record my name I will come to thee and I will bless thee.

25. And if thou make to me an altar of stone, thou shall not build it of hewn stones, for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou have polluted it.

26. Neither shall thou go up by steps to my altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered on it.

## Exodus 21

1. Now these are the ordinances which thou shall set before them.

2. If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve, and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

3. If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.

4. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her sons shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.

5. But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my sons, I will not go out free,

6. then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door, or to the door-post, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.

7. And if a man sells his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.

8. If she does not please her master, who has espoused her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.

9. And if he espouses her to his son, he shall deal with her according to the manner of daughters.

10. If he takes him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, he shall not diminish.

11. And if he does not do these three things to her, then she shall go out for nothing, without money.

12. He who smites a man, so that he dies, shall surely be put to death.

13. And if a man does not lie in wait, but God delivers him into his hand, then I will appoint for thee a place where he shall flee.

14. And if a man comes presumptuously upon his neighbor, to kill him with guile, thou shall take him from my altar, that he may die.

15. And he who smites his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

16. And he who steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

17. And he who curses his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

18. And if men contend, and one smites the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he does not die, but keeps his bed,

19. if he rises again, and walks abroad upon his staff, then he who smote him shall be acquitted. Only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

20. And if a man smites his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.

21. Notwithstanding, if he continues a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money.

22. And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow, he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.

23. But if any harm follows, then thou shall give life for life,

24. eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

25. burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

26. And if a man smites the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

27. And if he knocks out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

28. And if an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall be acquitted.

29. But if the ox was accustomed to gore in time past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death.

30. If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid upon him.

31. Whether it has gored a son, or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.

32. If the ox gores a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

33. And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls in it,

34. the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money to the owner of it, and the dead beast shall be his.

35. And if one man's ox hurts another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it, and the dead they shall also divide.

36. Or if it be known that the ox was accustomed to gore in time past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own.

## Exodus 22

1. If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

2. If the thief is found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.

3. If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him. A thief shall make restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.

4. If the theft is found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or donkey, or sheep, he shall pay double.

5. If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feeds in another man's field, he shall make restitution of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard.

6. If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed, he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

7. If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house, if the thief be found, he shall pay double.

8. If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall come near to God, to see whether he has not put his hand to his neighbor's goods.

9. For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, of which a man says, This is it, the case of both parties shall come before God. He whom God shall condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.

10. If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it dies, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it,

11. the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he has not put his hand to his neighbor's goods. And the owner of it shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.

12. But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner of it.

13. If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence. He shall not make good that which was torn.

14. And if a man borrows anything of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner of it not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.

15. If the owner of it is with it, he shall not make it good. If it be a hired thing, it came for its hire.

16. And if a man entices a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.

17. If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

18. Thou shall not allow a sorceress to live.

19. Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.

20. He who sacrifices to any god, except to Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed.

21. And thou shall not wrong a sojourner, neither shall thou oppress him, for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.

22. Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

23. If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry,

24. and my wrath shall grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall be widows, and your sons fatherless.

25. If thou lend money to any of my people with thee who is poor, thou shall not be to him as a creditor, neither shall ye lay upon him interest.

26. If thou at all take thy neighbor's garment to pledge, thou shall restore it to him before the sun goes down,

27. for that is his only covering. It is his garment for his skin. How shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he cries to me, that I will hear, for I am gracious.

28. Thou shall not revile God, nor speak ill of a ruler of thy people.

29. Thou shall not delay to offer from thy harvest, and from the outflow of thy presses. The firstborn of thy sons thou shall give to me.

30. Likewise thou shall do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep. Seven days it shall be with its dam. On the eighth day thou shall give it me.

31. And ye shall be holy men to me. Therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field. Ye shall cast it to the dogs.

## Exodus 23

1. Thou shall not take up a false report. Do not put thy hand with the wicked man to be an unrighteous witness.

2. Thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil, neither shall thou speak in a case to turn aside after a multitude to distort justice,

3. neither shall thou favor a poor man in his case.

4. If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his donkey going astray, thou shall surely bring it back to him again.

5. If thou see the donkey of him who hates thee lying under his burden, thou shall refrain leaving him. Thou shall surely release it with him.

6. Thou shall not distort the justice due to thy poor in his case.

7. Keep thee far from a false matter. And do not kill an innocent and righteous man, for I will not justify a wicked man.

8. And thou shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have sight, and perverts the words of the righteous.

9. And thou shall not oppress a sojourner, for ye know the heart of a sojourner, since ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.

10. And six years thou shall sow thy land, and shall gather in the increase of it,

11. but the seventh year thou shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat, and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shall deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

12. Six days thou shall do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shall rest, that thine ox and thy donkey may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed.

13. And in all things that I have said to you take ye heed, and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.

14. Three times thou shall keep a feast to me in the year.

15. Thou shall keep the feast of unleavened bread (Seven days thou shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in it thou came out from Egypt, and none shall appear before me empty),

16. and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sow in the field, and the feast of ingathering at the end of the year, when thou gather in thy labors out of the field.

17. Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord Jehovah.

18. Thou shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.

19. The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shall bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

20. Behold, I send an agent before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

21. Take ye heed before him, and hearken to his voice, provoke him not. For he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him.

22. But if thou shall indeed hearken to his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to thine enemies, and an adversary to thine adversaries.

23. For my agent shall go before thee, and bring thee in to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I will cut them off.

24. Thou shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works, but thou shall utterly overthrow them, and break their pillars in pieces.

25. And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

26. There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land; I will fulfill the number of thy days.

27. I will send my terror before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shall come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs to thee.

28. And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

29. I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.

30. Little by little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

31. And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and thou shall drive them out before thee.

32. Thou shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

33. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me, for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to thee.

## Exodus 24

1. And he said to Moses, Come up to Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship ye afar off.

2. And Moses alone shall come near to Jehovah, but they shall not come near, neither shall the people go up with him.

3. And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances. And all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah has spoken will we do.

4. And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar below the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

5. And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, who offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to Jehovah.

6. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

7. And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people. And they said, All that Jehovah has spoken will we do, and be obedient.

8. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has made with you concerning all these words.

9. Then Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up.

10. And they saw the God of Israel. And there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.

11. And he laid not his hand upon the nobles of the sons of Israel. And they beheld God, and ate and drank.

12. And Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to me onto the mount, and be there, and I will give thee the tablets of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou may teach them.

13. And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister, and Moses went up onto the mount of God.

14. And he said to the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again to you. And, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a case, let him come near to them.

15. And Moses went up onto the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.

16. And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

17. And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the sons of Israel.

18. And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up onto the mount. And Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights.

## Exodus 25

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, that they take for me an offering; of every man whose heart makes him willing ye shall take my offering.

4. and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

5. and rams' skins dyed red, and certain skins, and acacia wood,

21. And thou shall put the mercy-seat above upon the ark. And in the ark thou shall put the testimony that I shall give thee.

22. And there I will meet with thee. And I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment to the sons of Israel.

34. and in the lampstand four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knobs of it, and the flowers of it.

1. And this is the thing that thou shall do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock and two rams without blemish,

3. and thou shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

13. And thou shall take all the fat that covers the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

14. But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and it dung, thou shall burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering.

15. Thou shall also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.

16. And thou shall slay the ram, and thou shall take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

17. And thou shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head,

19. And thou shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.

20. Then thou shall kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

21. And thou shall take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him. And he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

22. Also thou shall take from the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),

23. and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah,

24. and thou shall put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and shall wave them for a wave offering before Jehovah.

25. And thou shall take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt offering, for a sweet savor before Jehovah. It is an offering made by fire to Jehovah.

26. And thou shall take the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before Jehovah, and it shall be thy portion.

27. And thou shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons,

28. and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion forever from the sons of Israel, for it is a heave offering. And it shall be a heave offering from the sons of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to Jehovah.

29. And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.

30. Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.

31. And thou shall take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.

32. And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.

33. And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them, but a stranger shall not eat of it, because they are holy.

34. And if any of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then thou shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

35. And thus thou shall do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee. Seven days thou shall consecrate them.

36. And every day thou shall offer the bullock of sin offering for atonement. And thou shall cleanse the altar when thou make atonement for it, and thou shall anoint it, to sanctify it.

37. Seven days thou shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it. And the altar shall be most holy. Whatever touches the altar shall be holy.

38. Now this is that which thou shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.

39. The one lamb thou shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb thou shall offer at evening.

40. And with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.

41. And the other lamb thou shall offer at evening, and shall do thereto according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering of it, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.

42. It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak to thee there.

43. And there I will meet with the sons of Israel, and the tent shall be sanctified by my glory.

44. And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar. I will also sanctify Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office.

45. And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will be their God.

46. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them. I am Jehovah their God.

## Exodus 30

1. And thou shall make an altar to burn incense upon. Thou shall make it of acacia wood.

2. A cubit shall be the length of it, and a cubit the breadth of it (it shall be foursquare), and two cubits shall be the height of it. The horns of it shall be of one piece with it.

3. And thou shall overlay it with pure gold, the top of it, and the sides of it round about, and the horns of it. And thou shall make to it a crown of gold round about.

4. And two golden rings thou shall make for it under the crown of it, upon the two ribs of it, upon the two sides of it thou shall make them. And they shall be for places for staves with which to bear it.

5. And thou shall make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.

6. And thou shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.

7. And Aaron shall burn in it incense of sweet spices. Every morning, when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn it.

8. And when Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.

9. Ye shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering. And ye shall pour no drink offering on it.

10. And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year, with the blood of the sin offering of atonement. Once in the year he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to Jehovah.

11. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

12. When thou take the sum of the sons of Israel, according to those who are numbered of them, then they shall give every man a ransom for his soul to Jehovah when thou number them, that there be no plague among them when thou number them.

13. This they shall give, everyone who passes over to those who are numbered: half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary, (the shekel is twenty gerahs,) half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah.

14. Everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.

15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.

16. And thou shall take the atonement money from the sons of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.

17. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Thou shall also make a laver of brass, and the base of it of brass for washing. And thou shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shall put water in it.

19. And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet there.

20. When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die, or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Jehovah.

21. So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die. And it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

22. Moreover Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Take thou also to thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,

24. and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.

25. And thou shall make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer. It shall be a holy anointing oil.

26. And thou shall anoint with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,

27. and the table and all the vessels of it, and the lampstand and the vessels of it, and the altar of incense,

28. and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels of it, and the laver and the base of it.

29. And thou shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.

30. And thou shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.

31. And thou shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.

32. Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition of it. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you.

33. Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.

34. And Jehovah said to Moses, Take to thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense, of each shall there be a like weight.

35. And thou shall make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.

36. And thou shall beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee. It shall be to you most holy.

37. And the incense which thou shall make, ye shall not make for yourselves according to the composition of it. It shall be to thee holy for Jehovah.

38. Whoever shall make like that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people.

## Exodus 31

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,

3. and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

4. to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,

5. and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.

6. And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:

7. the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is on it, and all the furniture of the tent,

8. and the table and its vessels, and the pure lampstand with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,

9. and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,

10. and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,

11. and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded thee they shall do.

12. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

13. Speak thou also to the sons of Israel, saying, Truly ye shall keep my sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifies you.

14. Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death, for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

15. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah. Whoever does any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

16. Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

17. It is a sign between me and the sons of Israel forever. For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

18. And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.

## Exodus 32

1. And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make gods for us, which shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.

2. And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.

3. And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.

4. And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf. And they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

5. And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.

6. And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to revel.

7. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go, get thee down. For thy people, that thou brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.

8. They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made for them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

9. And Jehovah said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.

10. Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may grow hot against them, and that I may consume them. And I will make of thee a great nation.

11. And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why does thy wrath grow hot against thy people, whom thou have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?

12. Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, He brought them forth for evil, to kill them on the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and relent of this evil against thy people.

13. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swore by thine own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven. And all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.

14. And Jehovah relented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.

15. And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

16. And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.

17. And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

18. And he said, It is not the voice of those who shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome, but the noise of those who sing do I hear.

19. And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing. And Moses' anger grew hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.

20. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the sons of Israel drink of it.

21. And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to thee, that thou have brought a great sin upon them?

22. And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord grow hot. Thou know the people, that they are set on evil.

23. For they said to me, Make gods for us, which shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.

24. And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.

25. And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)

26. then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on Jehovah's side, come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.

27. And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.

28. And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

29. And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

30. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Jehovah, perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.

31. And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made gods of gold for them.

32. Yet now, if thou will forgive their sin-, and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou have written.

33. And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.

34. And now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to thee. Behold, my agent shall go before thee. Nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.

35. And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

## Exodus 33

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Depart, go up from here, thou and the people that thou have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed will I give it.

2. And I will send an agent before thee, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite-

3. to a land flowing with milk and honey. For I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee on the way.

4. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned, and no man put his ornaments on him.

5. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to the sons of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people. If I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee. Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee.

6. And the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.

7. Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, afar off from the camp, and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that everyone who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.

8. And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tent.

9. And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent, and Jehovah spoke with Moses.

10. And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent. And all the people rose up and worshiped, every man at his tent door.

11. And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend, and he turned again into the camp. But his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart out of the tent.

12. And Moses said to Jehovah, See, thou say to me, Bring up this people, and thou have not let me know whom thou will send with me. Yet thou have said, I know thee by name, and thou have also found favor in my sight.

13. Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight. And consider that this nation is thy people.

14. And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.

15. And Moses said to him, If thy presence go not, do not carry us up from here.

16. For how shall it now be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? Is it not in that thou go with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?

17. And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou have spoken, for thou have found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name.

18. And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.

19. And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee. I will be merciful to whom I may be merciful, and I will be compassionate to whomever I may be compassionate.

20. And he said, Thou cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.

21. And Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shall stand upon the rock.

22. And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by.

23. And I will take away my hand, and thou shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.

## Exodus 34

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Hew thee two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write upon the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which thou broke.

2. And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.

3. And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount, neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.

4. And he hewed two tablets of stone like the first. And Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.

5. And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.

6. And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,

7. keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, and upon the sons's sons, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.

8. And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.

9. And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

10. And he said, Behold, I make a covenant. Before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation, and all the people among which thou are shall see the work of Jehovah, for it is an awesome thing that I do with thee.

11. Observe thou that which I command thee this day. Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

12. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where thou go, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee.

13. But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim,

14. for thou shall worship no other god. For Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.

15. Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and a man calls thee and thou eat of his sacrifice,

16. and thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods.

17. Thou shall make thee no molten gods.

18. Thou shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days thou shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib thou came out from Egypt.

19. All that opens the womb is mine, and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep.

20. And the firstling of a donkey thou shall redeem with a lamb, and if thou will not redeem it, then thou shall break its neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.

21. Six days thou shall work, but on the seventh day thou shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shall rest.

22. And thou shall observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering in the middle of the year.

23. Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.

24. For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders. Neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou go up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year.

25. Thou shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.

26. The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shall bring to the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

27. And Jehovah said to Moses, Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.

28. And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread, nor drank water, and he wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

29. And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.

30. And when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.

31. And Moses called to them. And Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.

32. And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him on mount Sinai.

33. And when Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.

34. But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke to the sons of Israel that which he was commanded.

35. And the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone. And Moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him.

## Exodus 35

1. And Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, These are the words which Jehovah has commanded, that ye should do them.

2. Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to Jehovah. Whoever does any work in it shall be put to death.

3. Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.

4. And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying,

5. Take ye from among you an offering to Jehovah. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it-Jehovah's offering: gold, and silver, and brass,

6. and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

7. and rams' skins dyed red, and certain skins, and acacia wood,

8. and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,

9. and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

10. And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Jehovah has commanded:

11. the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,

12. the ark, and the staves of it, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen,

13. the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread,

14. the lampstand also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light,

15. and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle,

16. the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,

17. the hangings of the court, the pillars of it, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court,

18. the pegs of the tabernacle, and the pegs of the court, and their cords,

19. the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

20. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

21. And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought Jehovah's offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service of it, and for the holy garments.

22. And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, and earrings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold, even every man who offered an offering of gold to Jehovah.

23. And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and certain skins, brought them.

24. Everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought Jehovah's offering, and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.

25. And all the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun: the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.

26. And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair.

27. And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate,

28. and the spice, and the oil, for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

29. The sons of Israel brought a freewill offering to Jehovah, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded to be made by Moses.

30. And Moses said to the sons of Israel, See, Jehovah has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.

31. And he has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

32. and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,

33. and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.

34. And he has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

35. He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who devise skilful works.

## Exodus 36

1. And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah has commanded.

2. And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it,

3. and they received from Moses all the offering which the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. And they brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning.

4. And all the wise men, who wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought.

5. And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.

6. And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.

7. For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

8. And all the wise-hearted men among them who wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains, of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim; the work of the skilful workman made them.

9. The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure.

10. And he coupled five curtains one to another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.

11. And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.

12. Fifty loops he made in the one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling; the loops were opposite one to another.

13. And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was one.

14. And he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. Eleven curtains he made them.

15. The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain. The eleven curtains had one measure.

16. And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

17. And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops he made upon the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling.

18. And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.

19. And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of certain skins above.

20. And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up.

21. Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.

22. Each board had two tenons, joined one to another. Thus he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.

23. And he made the boards for the tabernacle. Twenty boards for the south side southward.

24. And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.

25. And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,

26. and their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

27. And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

28. And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part.

29. And they were double beneath, and in like manner they were entire to the top of it to one ring. Thus he did to both of them in the two corners.

30. And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, under every board two sockets.

31. And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,

32. and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.

33. And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.

34. And he overlaid the boards with gold. And made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

35. And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. He made it with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman.

36. And he made for it four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four sockets of silver.

37. And he made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer,

38. and the five pillars of it with their hooks. And he overlaid their capitals and their bands with gold, and their five sockets were of brass.

## Exodus 37

1. And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it.

2. And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a crown of gold to it round about.

8. one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end, of one piece with the mercy-seat. He made the cherubim at the two ends of it.

9. And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another. The faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy-seat.

10. And he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits the length of it, and a cubit the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it.

11. And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.

12. And he made to it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border of it round about.

13. And he cast four rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet of it,

14. close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.

15. And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

16. And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes of it, and the spoons of it, and the bowls of it, and the flagons of it, with which to pour out, of pure gold.

17. And he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of beaten work, even its base, and its shaft, its cups, its knobs, and its flowers, were of one piece with it.

18. And there were six branches going out of the sides of it, three branches of the lampstand out of the one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it,

19. three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knob and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knob and a flower, so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.

20. And in the lampstand were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knobs of it, and the flowers of it,

21. and a knob under two branches of one piece with it, and a knob under two branches of one piece with it, and a knob under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.

22. Their knobs and their branches were of one piece with it. The whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold.

23. And he made the lamps of it, seven, and the snuffers of it, and the snuff dishes of it, of pure gold.

24. He made it of a talent of pure gold, and all the vessels of it.

26. And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top of it, and the sides of it round about, and the horns of it. And he made to it a crown of gold round about.

2. And he made the horns of it upon the four corners of it. The horns of it were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with brass.

3. And he made all the vessels of the altar: the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the firepans. All the vessels of it he made of brass.

4. And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway up.

5. And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be places for the staves.

6. And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass.

7. And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to bear it; he made it hollow with planks.

8. And he made the laver of brass, and the base of it of brass, from the mirrors of the women who fasted, who fasted by the doors of the tabernacle of witness, in the day in which he set it up.

9. And he made the court. For the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits,

10. their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.

11. And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass, the hooks of the pillars, and their bands, of silver.

12. And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten, the hooks of the pillars, and their bands, of silver.

13. And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

14. The hangings for the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three,

15. and so for the other side. On this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three.

16. All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.

17. And the sockets for the pillars were of brass, the hooks of the pillars, and their bands, of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver. And all the pillars of the court were banded with silver.

18. And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. And twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

19. And their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass, their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their bands, of silver.

20. And all the pegs of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.

21. This is the sum of the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.

22. And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah commanded Moses.

23. And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skilful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in fine linen.

24. All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty-nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

25. And the silver from those who were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary,

26. a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

27. And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil, a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

28. And of the thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made bands for them.

29. And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.

30. And with it he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

31. and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs of the court round about.

## Exodus 39

1. And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

2. And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

3. And they beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman.

4. They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together. It was joined together at the two ends.

5. And the skillfully woven band, that was upon it with which to gird it on, was of the same piece and like the work of it, of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

6. And they wrought the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel.

7. And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the sons of Israel, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

8. And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod, of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

9. It was foursquare. They made the breastplate double; a span was the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, being double.

10. And they set four rows of stones in it. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row,

11. and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond,

12. and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst,

13. and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in enclosures of gold in their settings.

14. And the stones were according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, each one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.

15. And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.

16. And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

17. And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.

18. And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart of it.

19. And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge of it, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.

20. And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart of it, close by the coupling of it, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.

21. And they bound the breastplate by the rings of it to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

22. And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

23. And the hole of the robe in the midst of it, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be torn.

24. And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, twined.

25. And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates,

26. a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

27. And they made the tunics of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,

28. and the miter of fine linen, and the goodly head-coverings of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,

29. and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

30. And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.

31. And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the miter above, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

32. Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. And the sons of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did they.

33. And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all its furniture: its clasps, its boards, it bars, and its pillars, and it sockets,

34. and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of certain skins, and the veil of the screen,

35. the ark of the testimony, and the staves of it, and the mercy-seat,

36. the table, all the vessels of it, and the showbread,

37. the pure lampstand, the lamps of it, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels of it, and the oil for the light,

38. and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the tent,

39. the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,

40. the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords of it, and the pegs of it, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting,

41. the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

42. According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did all the work.

43. And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it, as Jehovah had commanded, even so they had done it. And Moses blessed them.

## Exodus 40

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. On the first day of the first month thou shall raise up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.

3. And thou shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and thou shall screen the ark with the veil.

4. And thou shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it, and thou shall bring in the lampstand, and light the lamps of it.

5. And thou shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.

6. And thou shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.

7. And thou shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shall put water in it.

8. And thou shall set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.

9. And thou shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shall hallow it, and all the furniture of it. And it shall be holy.

10. And thou shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar. And the altar shall be most holy.

11. And thou shall anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.

12. And thou shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water.

13. And thou shall put upon Aaron the holy garments, and thou shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.

14. And thou shall bring his sons, and put tunics upon them,

15. and thou shall anoint them, as thou anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. And their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

16. Thus did Moses. According to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.

17. And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up.

18. And Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards of it, and put in the bars of it, and raised up its pillars.

19. And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

20. And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark.

21. And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

22. And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil.

23. And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

24. And he put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

25. And he lit the lamps before Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

26. And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil,

27. and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

28. And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.

29. And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

30. And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it, with which to wash.

31. And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.

32. They washed when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near to the altar, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

33. And he raised up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.

34. Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.

35. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereupon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.

36. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys,

37. but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey till the day that it was taken up.

38. For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
