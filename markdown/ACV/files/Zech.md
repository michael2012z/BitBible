# Zechariah

## Zechariah 1

1. In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,

2. Jehovah was greatly displeased with your fathers.

3. Therefore say thou to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Return to me, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts.

4. Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings, but they did not hear, nor hearken to me, says Jehovah.

5. Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?

6. But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so he has dealt with us.

7. Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,

8. I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom. And behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.

9. Then I said, O my lord, what are these? And the agent who talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are.

10. And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

11. And they answered the agent of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.

12. Then the agent of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long will thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou have had indignation these seventy years?

13. And Jehovah answered the agent who talked with me with good words, comforting words.

14. So the agent who talked with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

15. And I am very greatly displeased with the nations that are at ease. For I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.

16. Therefore thus says Jehovah: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.

17. Cry yet again, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity, and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

18. And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.

19. And I said to the agent who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

20. And Jehovah showed me four smiths.

21. Then I said, What are these coming to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.

## Zechariah 2

1. And I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.

2. Then I said, Where do thou go? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem. To see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it.

3. And, behold, the agent who talked with me went forth. And another agent went out to meet him,

4. and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle therein.

5. For I, says Jehovah, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.

6. Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says Jehovah. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says Jehovah.

7. Ho Zion, escape, thou who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.

8. For thus says Jehovah of hosts: After glory he has sent me to the nations which plundered you. For he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.

9. For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those who served them. And ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me.

10. Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, says Jehovah.

11. And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee. And thou shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to thee.

12. And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

13. Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah, for he has arisen out of his holy habitation.

## Zechariah 3

1. And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the agent of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.

2. And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan. Yea, Jehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?

3. Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the agent.

4. And he answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.

5. And I said, Let them set a clean miter upon his head. So they set a clean miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the agent of Jehovah was standing by.

6. And the agent of Jehovah testified to Joshua, saying,

7. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: If thou will walk in my ways, and if thou will keep my charge, then thou also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these who stand by.

8. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows who sit before thee, for they are men who are a sign. For, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.

9. For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua. Upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave the graving of it, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.

10. In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, ye shall invite each man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.

## Zechariah 4

1. And the agent who talked with me came again, and awoke me, as a man who is awakened out of his sleep.

2. And he said to me, What do thou see? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top of it,

3. and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side of it.

4. And I answered and spoke to the agent who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?

5. Then the agent who talked with me answered and said to me, Do thou not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

6. Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.

7. Who are thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shall become a plain, and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, to it.

8. Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

9. The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it. And thou shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you.

10. For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.

11. Then I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the lampstand and upon the left side of it?

12. And I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts that empty the golden oil out of themselves?

13. And he answered me and said, Do thou not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

14. Then he said, These are the two anointed ones, who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

## Zechariah 5

1. Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll.

2. And he said to me, What do thou see? And I answered, I see a flying roll. The length of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits.

3. Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole land. For everyone who steals shall be cut off on the one side according to it, and everyone who swears shall be cut off on the other side according to it.

4. I will cause it to go forth, says Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.

5. Then the agent who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what this is that goes forth.

6. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land

7. (and, behold, a talent of lead was lifted up), and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.

8. And he said, This is Wickedness. And he cast her down into the midst of the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth of it.

9. Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.

10. Then I said to the agent who talked with me, Where do these carry the ephah?

11. And he said to me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar. And when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.

## Zechariah 6

1. And again I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of brass.

2. In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses,

3. and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot strong grizzled horses.

4. Then I answered and said to the agent who talked with me, What are these, my lord?

5. And the agent answered and said to me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.

6. The chariot in which are the black horses goes forth toward the north country, and the white went forth after them, and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.

7. And the strong ones went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, Get you from here. Walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

8. Then he cried to me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.

9. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,

10. Take from those of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.

11. Yea, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

12. And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. And he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of Jehovah,

13. even he shall build the temple of Jehovah. And he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne. And he shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.

14. And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.

15. And those who are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah. And ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.

## Zechariah 7

1. And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev.

2. Now those of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Jehovah,

3. and to speak to the priests of the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?

4. Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,

5. Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, even to me?

6. And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do ye not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?

7. Should ye not hear the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?

8. And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,

9. Thus Jehovah of hosts has spoken, saying, Execute true justice, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother.

10. And do not oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor man. And let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.

11. But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.

12. Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts.

13. And it has come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts.

14. But I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned. For they laid the pleasant land desolate.

## Zechariah 8

1. And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.

3. Thus says Jehovah: I am returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.

4. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.

5. And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets of it.

6. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? says Jehovah of hosts.

7. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country.

8. And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.

9. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.

10. For before those days there was no wage for man, nor any wage for beast, nor was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men each one against his neighbor.

11. But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days, says Jehovah of hosts.

12. For there shall be the seed of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.

13. And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not. Let your hands be strong.

14. For thus says Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, says Jehovah of hosts, and I did not relent,

15. so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear ye not.

16. These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates.

17. And let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath. For all these are things that I hate, says Jehovah.

18. And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,

19. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah, joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.

20. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, and the inhabitants of many cities.

21. And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts. I will go also.

22. Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.

23. Thus says Jehovah of hosts: In those days, ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.

## Zechariah 9

1. The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah),

2. and also Hamath, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.

3. And Tyre built herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

4. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.

5. Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also, and shall be greatly pained, and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame. And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

6. And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

7. And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth. And he also shall be a remnant for our God, and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

8. And I will encamp the army around my house, that none pass through or return, and no oppressor shall pass through them any more. For now I have seen with my eyes.

9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, thy king comes to thee. He is just, and having salvation, lowly, and riding upon a donkey, even upon a colt the foal of a donkey.

10. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace to the nations. And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.

11. As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit in which is no water.

12. Turn you back to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope. Even today I declare that I will render double to thee.

13. For I have bent Judah for me. I have filled the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.

14. And Jehovah shall be seen over them. And his arrow shall go forth as the lightning. And the lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.

15. Jehovah of hosts will defend them. And they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones. And they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine, and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.

16. And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people, as for the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.

17. For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.

## Zechariah 10

1. Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, even of Jehovah who makes lightnings, and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.

2. For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and they have told false dreams. They comfort in vain. Therefore they go their way like sheep. They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.

3. My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats. For Jehovah of hosts has visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.

4. From him shall come forth the cornerstone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.

5. And they shall be as mighty men, treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.

6. And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back. For I have mercy upon them, and they shall be as though I had not cast them off. For I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them.

7. And Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine. Yea, their sons shall see it, and rejoice. Their heart shall be glad in Jehovah.

8. I will whistle for them, and gather them. For I have redeemed them, and they shall increase as they have increased.

9. And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember me in far countries. And they shall live with their sons, and shall return.

10. I will also bring them again out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria. And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and until space shall not be found for them.

11. And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.

12. And I will strengthen them in Jehovah, and they shall walk up and down in his name, says Jehovah.

## Zechariah 11

1. Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.

2. Wail, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the fine ones are destroyed. Wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest has come down.

3. A voice of the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed. A voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.

4. Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter,

5. whose possessors kill them, and hold themselves not guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich, and their own shepherds pity them not.

6. For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah. But, lo, I will deliver the men each one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king. And they shall smite the land, and I will not deliver them out of their hand.

7. So I fed the flock of slaughter, truly the poor of the flock. And I took to me two staves, the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands, and I fed the flock.

8. And I cut off the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.

9. Then I said, I will not feed you. That which dies, let it die, and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off, and let those who are left eat each one the flesh of another.

10. And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.

11. And it was broken in that day, and thus the poor of the flock who gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.

12. And I said to them, If ye think good, give me my wage, and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my wage thirty pieces of silver.

13. And Jehovah said to me, Cast it to the potter, the good price that I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of Jehovah.

14. Then I cut apart my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

15. And Jehovah said to me, Take to thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.

16. For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, nor will he seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound, but he will eat the flesh of the fat, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.

17. Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! The sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye. His arm shall be entirely dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

## Zechariah 12

1. The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus says Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him:

2. Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also it shall be in the siege against Jerusalem.

3. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples. All who burden themselves with it shall be severely wounded. And all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.

4. In that day, says Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness. And I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.

5. And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God.

6. In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves. And they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left, and Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.

7. Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah.

8. In that day Jehovah shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And he who is feeble among them at that day shall be as David, and the house of David shall be as God, as the agent of Jehovah before them.

9. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

10. And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication. And they shall look to me whom they have pierced. And they shall mourn for him, as a man mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as a man who is in bitterness for his firstborn.

11. In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

12. And the land shall mourn, every family apart, the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart, the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart,

13. the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart, the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart,

14. all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

## Zechariah 13

1. In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.

2. And it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered. And I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

3. And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother who begot him shall say to him, Thou shall not live, for thou speak lies in the name of Jehovah. And his father and his mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.

4. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed each one of his vision, when he prophesies, nor shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive.

5. But he shall say, I am no prophet. I am a tiller of the ground, for I have been made a bondman from my youth.

6. And a man shall say to him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.

7. Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is my companion, says Jehovah of hosts. Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. And I will turn my hand upon the little ones.

8. And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, says Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die, but the third shall be left in it.

9. And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them. I will say, It is my people, and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.

## Zechariah 14

1. Behold, a day of Jehovah comes when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.

2. For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle. And the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished, and half of the city shall go forth into captivity. And the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.

3. Then Jehovah shall go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.

4. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. And the mount of Olives shall be split in the midst of it toward the east and toward the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.

5. And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel. Yea, ye shall flee, just as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee.

6. And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the bright ones shall withdraw themselves.

7. But it shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, not day, and not night. But it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light.

8. And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea. In summer and in winter it shall be.

9. And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth. In that day Jehovah shall be one, and his name one.

10. All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's wine-presses.

11. And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.

12. And this shall be the plague with which Jehovah will smite all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.

13. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah shall be among them, and they shall lay hold each one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.

14. And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

15. And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as that plague.

16. And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.

17. And it shall be, that of the families of the earth he who does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain.

18. And if the family of Egypt does not go up, and does not come, that there shall be the plague with which Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

19. This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

20. In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY TO JEHOVAH, and the pots in Jehovah's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.

21. Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in it. And in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.
