# Mark

## Mark 1

1. The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

2. As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my agent before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.

3. The voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.

4. It came to pass, that John was immersing in the wilderness and preaching an immersion of repentance for remission of sins.

5. And all the land of Judea and the Jerusalemites went out to him, and they were all immersed by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

6. And John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and eating locusts and wild honey.

7. And he preached, saying, A man mightier than I comes after me of whom I am not worthy, having stooped down, to loosen the strap of his shoes.

8. I indeed immersed you in water, but he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.

9. And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in the Jordan.

10. And straightaway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens divided, and the Spirit descending upon him as a dove.

11. And a voice occurred out of the heavens, Thou are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

12. And straightaway the Spirit drives him forth into the wilderness.

13. And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild beasts. And the agents served him.

14. Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God,

15. and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent ye, and believe in the good news.

16. And walking beside the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, the son of Simon, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.

17. And Jesus said to them, Come ye behind me, and I will make you to become fishermen of men.

18. And straightaway they left the nets, and followed him.

19. And having advanced a little from there he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.

20. And straightaway he called them. And having left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen, they went behind him.

21. And they entered into Capernaum, and straightaway on the sabbath day, having entered into the synagogue, he taught.

22. And they were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scholars.

23. And a man was in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,

24. saying, Oh no! What is with us and with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Did thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou are, the Holy man of God.

25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be thou muzzled, and come out of him.

26. And the unclean spirit, having convulsed him and having cried in a great voice, came out of him.

27. And they were all amazed, so as to question among themselves, saying, What is this? What is this new doctrine, that he commands with authority, and the unclean spirits also obey him?

28. And his fame went forth straightaway into the entire region around Galilee.

29. And straightaway, when they came forth out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

30. But Simon's mother-in-law lay feverish, and straightaway they tell him about her.

31. And upon coming, having taken hold of her hand, he raised her up and the fever left her. And straightaway she served them.

32. And having become evening when the sun set they brought to him all who were faring badly, and those who were demon-possessed.

33. And the whole city was gathered together near the door.

34. And he healed many who were faring badly with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he did not allow the demons to speak, because they had recognized him.

35. And having risen early, very much in the night, he came out and departed into a desolate place, and prayed there.

36. And Simon and those with him searched for him.

37. And having found him, they say to him, All are seeking thee.

38. And he says to them, Let us go into the nearby towns, so that I may preach there also. For I came forth for this.

39. And he was preaching in their synagogues in all Galilee, and casting out the demons.

40. And a leper comes to him beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If thou will thou can make me clean.

41. And Jesus, having felt compassion, having reached out his hand, he touched him, and says to him, I will, be thou clean.

42. And after he spoke, straightaway the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.

43. And having strictly warned him, straightaway he sent him out.

44. And he says to him, See thou say nothing to any man, but go, show thyself to the priest, and bring for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded for a testimony to them.

45. But having gone out, he began to proclaim it much, and to spread abroad the matter, so as for him to no longer be able to enter openly into a city, but was outside in desolate places. And they came to him from all directions.

## Mark 2

1. And having again entered into Capernaum, after some days it was heard that he was in a house.

2. And straightaway many were gathered together, so as to accommodate no more, not even near the door. And he spoke the word to them.

3. And they come bringing to him a paralyzed man, being taken by four men.

4. And not being able to come near to him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralyzed man lay.

5. And having seen their faith, Jesus says to the paralyzed man, Child, thy sins are forgiven thee.

6. But some of the scholars were sitting there, and deliberating in their hearts,

7. Why does this man speak blasphemies this way. Who can forgive sins but one, God?

8. And straightaway Jesus, having perceived in his spirit that they so deliberated within themselves, said to them, Why do ye deliberate these things in your hearts?

9. Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed and walk?

10. But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he says to the paralyzed man),

11. I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go to thy house.

12. And straightaway he arose, and having taken up the bed, he went forth before them all, so as for all to be amazed, and to glorify God, saying, We never saw it like this.

13. And he went forth again by the sea, and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.

14. And as he passed by he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And he says to him, Follow thou me. And having risen, he followed him.

15. And it came to pass, while he was dining in his house, that many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.

16. And the scholars of the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?

17. And when Jesus heard it he says to them, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those faring badly. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners for repentance.

18. And John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were fasting. And they come and say to him, Why do John's disciples and those of the Pharisees fast, but the disciples with you do not fast?

19. And Jesus said to them, The sons of the wedding hall cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them. As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

20. But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will they fast in those day.

21. And no man sews a new patch of cloth on an old garment, otherwise the patch of it pulls away, the new from the old, and a tear becomes worse.

22. And no man puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.

23. And it came to pass, that he was passing through the grain fields on the sabbath day, and his disciples began to make a path while plucking the ears.

24. And the Pharisees said to him, Look, why are they doing what is not permitted on the sabbath day?

25. And he said to them, Did ye never read what David did when he had need, and was hungry, he and those with him?

26. How he entered into the house of God under Abiathar the high priest, and ate the loaves of the presentation, which is not permitted to eat except for the priests. And he also gave to those who were with him?

27. And he said to them, The sabbath came into being for sake of man, and not man for sake of the sabbath.

28. So then the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.

## Mark 3

1. And he entered again into the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.

2. And they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day, so that they might accuse him.

3. And he says to the man who had a withered hand, Stand up in the midst.

4. And he says to them, Is it permitted to do good on the sabbath day or to do harm, to save life or to kill? But they were silent.

5. And having looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the callousness of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as the other.

6. And the Pharisees having gone out, they straightaway were making a plot with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

7. And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him.

8. And from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard how many things he did, came to him.

9. And he spoke to his disciples that a small boat would stay by him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him.

10. For he healed many, so as to press upon him, so that as many as had afflictions might touch him.

11. And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying, Thou are the Son of God.

12. And he chided them much that they should not make him known.

13. And he goes up onto the mountain, and calls in those whom he himself wanted, and they went to him.

14. And he appointed twelve men, so that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,

15. and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.

16. And he added to Simon the name Peter;

17. and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he added to them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder;

18. and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

19. and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And they come to a house.

20. And the multitude comes together again, so as for them, no, not even to be able to eat bread.

21. And when those with him heard it, they went out to grasp him, for they said, He is beside himself.

22. And the scholars who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.

23. And having summoned them, he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?

24. And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

25. And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

26. And if Satan has rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.

27. But no man, having enter into the house of the strong man, can plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he may plunder his house.

28. Truly I say to you, that all the sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and the blasphemies, as many as they may blaspheme.

29. But whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness, into the age, but is deserving of eternal damnation,

30. because they said, He has an unclean spirit.

31. Then his brothers and mother come, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.

32. And a multitude was sitting around him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brothers, and thy sisters, outside seek for thee.

33. And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother and my brothers?

34. And having looked around at those who sat about him, he says, Behold, my mother and my brothers.

35. For whoever may do the will of God, the same is my brother and sister and mother.

## Mark 4

1. And again he began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude was gathered to him, so as for him, after entering into the boat, to sit on the sea, and all the multitude was by the sea on the land.

2. And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching,

3. Listen. Behold, the man who sows went forth to sow.

4. And it came to pass during the sowing, some fell by the path, and the birds came and devoured it.

5. And others fell on the rocky ground where it had not much soil. And straightaway it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.

6. And when the sun was risen it was scorched, and because it had no root it dried out.

7. And others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it gave no fruit.

8. And others fell into the good ground and gave fruit, coming up and increasing, and brought forth, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.

9. And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

10. And when he became alone, those around him, with the twelve, asked him the parable.

11. And he said to them, To you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those outside, all things occur in parables.

12. So that seeing they may see, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand, lest they should turn, and the sins would be forgiven them.

13. And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? And how will ye understand all the parables?

14. The man who sows sows the word.

15. And these are those by the path where the word is sown. And whenever they may hear, straightaway Satan comes, and takes away the word that has been sown in their hearts.

16. And these in like manner are those being sown upon the rocky places, who, whenever they may hear the word, straightaway receive it with joy.

17. And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution develops because of the word, straightaway they are caused to stumble.

18. And these are those being sown in the thorns, who hear the word,

19. and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of wealth, and the cravings about other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

20. And these are those that were sown upon the good ground, who hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.

21. And he said to them, Does the lamp come so that it might be put under the bushel or under the bed? Is it not so that it might be put on the lampstand?

22. For there is not anything hid, except that it may be revealed, nor become secret, but that it may come to be visible.

23. If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.

24. And he said to them, Watch what ye hear. By what measure ye measure, it will be measured to you, and to those who hear, it will be added to you.

25. For whoever has, to him it will be given. And he who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.

26. And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,

27. and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and lengthen, he knows not how.

28. For the earth bears fruit spontaneously, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.

29. But when the fruit yields, straightaway he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.

30. And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?

31. It is like a grain of the mustard plant, which, when it is sown in the ground, is smaller than all the seeds upon the ground.

32. Yet when it is sown, it goes up and becomes greater than all the plants, and it makes great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under the shade of it.

33. And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.

34. And he did not speak to them apart from a parable, but privately he explained all things to his disciples.

35. And on that day, having become evening, he says to them, Let us pass through to the other side.

36. And having sent the multitude away, they bring him along as he was in the boat. And other small boats were also with him.

37. And a great storm of wind develops, and the waves were thrown into the boat, so as for it now to be filling.

38. And he himself was in the stern sleeping on the cushion. And they awake him, and say to him, Teacher, does it not concern thee that we perish?

39. And having awaken, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Be quiet! Silence! And the wind ceased, and it became a great calm.

40. And he said to them, Why are ye cowardly this way? How have ye no faith?

41. And they feared a great fear, and said to each other, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea also obey him?

## Mark 5

1. And they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gadarenes.

2. And when he came out of the boat, straightaway there met him out of the sepulchers a man with an unclean spirit who had his habitation among the sepulchers.

3. And no man was able to bind him, not even with chains.

4. Because he was often bound with shackles and chains, and the chains were pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces. And no man had strength to subdue him.

5. And always, night and day, in the mountains and in the sepulchers, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.

6. And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshiped him.

7. And having cried out in a great voice, he said, What is with me and with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, do not torment me.

8. For he said to him, Come out from the man, thou unclean spirit.

9. And he demanded him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion, because we are many.

10. And he besought him much that he would not send them outside of the territory.

11. Now there was near the mountain a great herd of swine feeding.

12. And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, so that we may enter into them.

13. And straightaway, Jesus allowed them. And the unclean spirits having come out, entered into the swine. And the herd stampeded down the slope into the sea, and were drowned in the sea. And there were about two thousand.

14. And those who fed the swine fled, and reported in the city and in the fields. And they came to see what it was that happened.

15. And they come to Jesus, and see the man who was demon-possessed, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind (the man who had the legion), and they were afraid.

16. And those who saw it related to them how it happened to the man who was demon-possessed, and about the swine.

17. And they began to beg him to depart from their borders.

18. And as he entered into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed besought him that he might be with him.

19. But Jesus did not allow him, but says to him, Go to thy house to thy men, and report to them how much the Lord has done for thee, and was merciful to thee.

20. And he departed, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus did for him. And all men marveled.

21. And when Jesus crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to him, and he was near the sea.

22. And behold, one of the synagogue rulers comes, Jairus by name. And having seen him, he falls at his feet,

23. and besought him much, saying, My little daughter has a terminal condition, so that having come, thou may lay thy hands on her, that she may be saved and will live.

24. And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.

25. And a certain woman, being with an issue of blood twelve years,

26. and having suffered many things by many physicians, and having spent all of her things, and was helped nothing, but who became worse instead,

27. when she heard about Jesus, having come in the crowd from behind, she touched his garment.

28. For she said, If I but touch his garments, I will be healed.

29. And straightaway the flow of her blood was dried up, and she knew in the body that she was healed of her scourge.

30. And straightaway, Jesus, when he recognized in himself that power went forth from him, having turned around in the crowd, he said, Who touched my garments?

31. And his disciples said to him, Thou see the multitude crowding thee, and thou say, Who touched me?

32. And he looked around to see the woman who did this thing.

33. But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what has happened to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.

34. And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has healed thee. Go in peace, and be healthy from thy scourge.

35. While he still spoke, they come from the synagogue ruler saying, Thy daughter died, why still trouble the teacher?

36. But straightaway, Jesus, having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.

37. And he allowed no man to accompany him except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.

38. And he comes to the house of the synagogue ruler, and sees a commotion, much weeping and wailing.

39. And when he entered in, he says to them, Why do ye make a commotion, and weep? The child did not die, but sleeps.

40. And they ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, takes the father of the child and the mother and those with him, and enters in where the child was lying.

41. And having taken the child's hand, he says to her, Talitha cumi. Which is, being interpreted, Little girl, I say to thee, awake.

42. And straightaway the little girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed with a great amazement.

43. And he commanded them much that no man should know this. And he said to give her to eat.

## Mark 6

1. And he went out from there, and came into his fatherland, and his disciples follow him.

2. And having become sabbath, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying, How are these things in this man? and, What is the wisdom that was given to him, and such mighty works happen by his hands?

3. Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judah and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended by him.

4. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his fatherland, and among his kin, and in his house.

5. And he could do no mighty work there, none, except having laid his hands upon a few feeble men he healed them.

6. And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages teaching.

7. And he summons the twelve, and began to send them forth in pairs. And he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.

8. And he commanded them that they should take up nothing for the way, except only a staff-no scrip, no bread, no copper in the belt-

9. but shod with sandals, and, Do not wear two coats.

10. And he said to them, Wherever ye enter into a house, lodge there until ye depart from there.

11. And as many as might not receive you nor hear you, as ye depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to them. Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

12. And having departed, they preached that men should repent.

13. And they cast out many demons, and anointed many feeble men with olive oil, and healed them.

14. And king Herod heard, for his name had become well known. And he said, John, the man who immerses, was raised from the dead, and because of this the powers work in him.

15. Others said, He is Elijah, and others said, He is a prophet, like one of the prophets.

16. But Herod, when he heard, said, This is John whom I beheaded. He was raised from the dead.

17. For Herod himself having sent forth, he arrested John, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he married her.

18. For John said to Herod, It is not permitted for thee to have thy brother's wife.

19. And Herodias was resentful toward him, and wanted to kill him. And she could not,

20. for Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. And having heard of him-the many things he was doing-he even heard of him gladly.

21. And having become an opportune day, when Herod on his birthday made a dinner for his chiefs, and the high captains, and the leading men of Galilee,

22. and the daughter of her (of Herodias) having come in and danced, and having pleased Herod and those who sat with the king, he said to the maiden, Ask of me whatever thou may want, and I will give to thee.

23. And he swore to her, Whatever thou may ask of me, I will give to thee, as much as half of my kingdom.

24. And having gone out, she said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the immerser.

25. And having come in straightaway with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I want that thou may give me, of it on a platter, the head of John the immerser.

26. And the king, who became exceeding sorry, did not want to refuse her because of the oaths, and of those dining together.

27. And straightaway having sent an executioner, the king commanded his head to be brought. And having departed, he beheaded him in the prison,

28. and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the maiden. And the maiden gave it to her mother.

29. And when his disciples heard, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a sepulcher.

30. And the apostles gather together to Jesus, and reported all to him, and how many things they did, and how many things they taught.

31. And he said to them, Come ye yourselves in private into a desolate place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no opportunity even to eat.

32. And they departed in the boat to a desolate place in private.

33. And they saw them going. And many recognized him, and ran together on foot there from all the cities. And they went before them, and came together to him.

34. And Jesus having come out, he saw a great multitude. And he felt compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.

35. And now many an hour having come to pass, his disciples having come to him, they say, The place is desolate, and it is now many an hour.

36. Send them away, so that after going into the fields and villages around, they may buy loaves for themselves, for they do not have what they may eat.

37. But having answered, he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, After departing, shall we buy loaves of two hundred denarii, and give them to eat?

38. And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? Go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

39. And he commanded them to sit down, all by companies upon the green grass.

40. And they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.

41. And after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves in pieces, and he gave to the disciples so that they might set before them. And he distributed the two fishes to them all.

42. And they all ate, and were filled.

43. And they took up fragments, twelve baskets full, and from the fishes.

44. And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.

45. And straightaway he compelled his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself would send the crowd away.

46. And after sending them away, he departed onto the mountain to pray.

47. And having become evening, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.

48. And he saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea, and wanted to passed by them.

49. But they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed it to be a ghost, and cried out.

50. For they all saw him, and were troubled. And straightaway he spoke with them, and says to them, Cheer up. It is I, fear not.

51. And he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased. And they were exceedingly amazed in themselves, extraordinarily so. And they wondered,

52. for they did not understand about the loaves, for their heart was hardened.

53. And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.

54. And when they came out of the boat, straightaway, having recognized him,

55. after running around that whole region around, they began to carry about on beds those who were faring badly, where they heard he was there.

56. And wherever he entered, into villages or cities or fields, they laid those who were feeble in the marketplaces, and besought him that if they might but touch the hem of his garment. And as many as touched him were being healed.

## Mark 7

1. And the Pharisees, and some of the scholars, having come from Jerusalem, gathered in to him.

2. And having seen some of his disciples eating their loaves with profane hands, that is, unwashed, they accused them.

3. (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands carefully, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders.

4. And coming from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they bathe. And there are many other things that they have taken in to retain: washings of cups, and pots, and brazen vessels, and beds.)

5. Then the Pharisees and the scholars demand of him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?

6. And having answered, he said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far distant from me.

7. But in vain they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.

8. For having set aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men: washings of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do.

9. And he said to them, Well do ye reject the commandment of God, so that ye may keep your tradition.

10. For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother, and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him perish in death.

11. But ye say, If a man should say to his father or mother, Whatever ye might be benefited from me is Corban, that is, an offering,

12. then ye no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,

13. annulling the word of God by your tradition that ye have delivered. And many such like things ye do.

14. And having summoned all the people, he said to them, Hear me all of you, and understand.

15. There is nothing outside the man, entering into him that can defile him, but the things coming out of him those are the things that defile the man.

16. If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.

17. And when he entered into a house from the crowd, his disciples questioned him about the parable.

18. And he says to them, Are also ye so without understanding? Do ye not perceive that everything outside that enters into the man cannot defile him,

19. because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the toilet (making all foods clean)?

20. And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.

21. For from inside the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts,

22. covetings, wickednesses, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, reviling, pride, foolishness.

23. All these evil things come from inside, and defile the man.

24. And having risen from there, he went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And having entered into a house, he wanted no man to know it, and yet he could not be hid.

25. For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, after hearing about him, having come, she fell down at his feet.

26. Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast out the demon from her daughter.

27. And Jesus said to her, Allow the children first be filled, for it is not right to take the children's bread and cast it to the house dogs.

28. But she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord, for even the house dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

29. And he said to her, Because of this saying, go thou. The demon has gone out of thy daughter.

30. And having departed to her house, she found the demon having gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

31. And again having departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee in the midst of the regions of Decapolis.

32. And they bring a deaf, tongue-tied man to him, and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.

33. And having taken him from the multitude in private, he put his fingers into his ears, and having spat, he touched his tongue.

34. And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

35. And straightaway his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.

36. And he commanded them that they should tell no man, but as much as he commanded them, so much the more abundantly they proclaimed it.

37. And they were exceedingly astonished, saying, He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear, and the mute to speak.

## Mark 8

1. In those days, the multitude being very great, and not having what they might eat, Jesus having summoned his disciples, he says to them,

2. I feel compassion toward the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and do not have what they might eat.

3. And if I send them away without food to their house, they will faint on the way, for some of them come from afar.

4. And his disciples answered him, From where will anyone be able to fill these men of loaves here in a desolate place?

5. And he questioned them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.

6. And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And after taking the seven loaves, having given thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to his disciples so that they might place before them. And they place before the crowd.

7. And they had a few small fishes. And having blessed them, he said to also place before them.

8. And they ate and were filled. And they took up seven hampers of surplus fragments.

9. And those who ate were about four thousand, and he sent them away.

10. And straightaway having entered into the boat with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

11. And the Pharisees came forth, and began to dispute with him, seeking from him a sign from the sky, testing him.

12. And having sighed deeply in his spirit, he says, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I am telling you if a sign will be given to this generation.

13. And having left them, having entered again into a boat, he departed to the other side.

14. And they forgot to take loaves, and they did not have with them in the boat except one loaf.

15. And he commanded them, saying, Take heed, watch for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.

16. And they deliberated among each other, saying, We have no loaves.

17. And knowing it Jesus says to them, Why do ye deliberate because ye have no loaves? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand? Have ye your heart still hardened?

18. Having eyes, ye see not, and having ears, ye hear not? And do ye not remember?

19. When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? They say to him, Twelve.

20. And when the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did ye take up? And they said, Seven.

21. And he said to them, How do ye not understand?

22. And he comes to Bethsaida, and they bring a blind man to him, and call for him so that he might touch him.

23. And having taken the hand of the blind man, he led him outside of the village. And having spat on his eyes, having laid his hands upon him, he questioned him if he sees anything?

24. And having looked up, he said, The men that I see, I see as trees walking.

25. Then again he put his hands upon his eyes, and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw all men clearly.

26. And he sent him away to his house, saying, Thou may neither go into the village, nor may tell any man in the village.

27. And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he questioned his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?

28. And they answered, saying, John the immerser, and others, Elijah, but others, one of the prophets.

29. And he says to them, But who do ye say that I am? And having answered, Peter says to him, Thou are the Christ.

30. And he chided them that they should tell no man about him.

31. And he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scholars, and be killed, and after three days to rise.

32. And he spoke the matter openly. And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him.

33. But he, having turned around, and having looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Go thee behind me, Satan, because thou think not the things of God, but the things of men.

34. And having called in the multitude with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wants to follow behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

35. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life because of me and the good news, this man will save it.

36. For what will it profit a man if he should gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?

37. Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

38. For whoever may be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy agents.

## Mark 9

1. And he said to them, Truly I say to you, there are some of those who have stood here, who will, no, not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God come in power.

2. And after six days Jesus takes Peter and James and John, and leads them up onto a high mountain alone, in private. And he was transfigured before them,

3. and his garments became glistening, exceedingly white, as snow, such as no fuller on earth is able to whiten.

4. And Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.

5. And having responded, Peter says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And we could make three tabernacles: one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

6. For he knew not what he would say, for they were frightened.

7. And a cloud developed overshadowing them. And a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son. Hear ye him.

8. And suddenly having looked around, they saw no man anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.

9. And as they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no man what they saw, except when the Son of man will rise from the dead.

10. And they kept the saying to themselves, discussing what is the rising from the dead.

11. And they questioned him, saying, The scholars say that Elijah must first come.

12. And having answered, he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first and restores all. And how it is written for the Son of man, that he would suffer many things and be rejected.

13. But I say to you, that Elijah has also come, and they did to him as much as they wanted, just as it is written for him.

14. And when they came to the disciples he saw a great multitude around them, and scholars disputing with them.

15. And straightaway all the multitude, having noticed him, were startled. And running near they greeted him.

16. And he questioned the scholars, What are ye disputing with them?

17. And having answered, one from the multitude said, Teacher, I brought my son to thee, who has a mute spirit.

18. And wherever it seizes him, it tears him, and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and becomes limp. And I spoke to thy disciples that they might cast it out, and they were not able.

19. And having answered him, he says, O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him to me.

20. And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, straightaway the spirit convulsed him. And having fallen on the ground, he wallowed, foaming.

21. And he questioned his father, How much time is it since this has happened to him? And he said, From childhood.

22. And it often casts him both into the fire and into the waters so that it might destroy him. But if thou can do anything, help us, having compassion toward us.

23. And Jesus said to him, If thou are able to believe, all things are possible to him who believes.

24. And straightaway the father of the child having cried out, he said with tears, I believe. Lord, help thou my unbelief.

25. And when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Thou mute and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and enter into him no more.

26. And having cried out, and having convulsed him much, it came out. And he became as if dead, so as for many to say that he was dead.

27. But having taken him by the hand, Jesus lifted him up, and he arose.

28. And when he came into the house, his disciples questioned him privately, We were not able to cast it out.

29. And he said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.

30. And having departed from there, they passed through Galilee, and he did not want that any man would know it.

31. For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And after being killed, he will rise the third day.

32. But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to question him.

33. And he came to Capernaum. And having become in the house he questioned them, What were ye deliberating among yourselves on the way?

34. But they were silent, for on the way they discussed among each other, who is greater.

35. And having sat down, he called the twelve, and he says to them, If any man wants to be first, he will be last of all, and helper of all.

36. And having taken a child, he set it in the midst of them. And after embracing it, he said to them,

37. Whoever may receive one of such children in my name, receives me, and whoever may receive me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.

38. And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain man, who does not follow us, casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.

39. But Jesus said, Forbid him not, for there is no man who will do a mighty work in my name, and will be able quickly to speak evil of me.

40. For he who is not against you is for you.

41. For whoever may give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye are of Christ, truly I say to you, he will, no, not lose his reward.

42. And whoever may cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is good for him instead, if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

43. And if thy hand may cause thee to stumble, cut it off. It is good for thee to enter into life maimed, than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,

44. where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.

45. And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble, cut it off. It is good for thee to enter into life crippled, than having thy two feet to be cast into hell, into the unquenchable fire

46. where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.

47. And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble, pluck it out. It is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire,

48. where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.

49. For every man will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt material.

50. The salt material is good, but if the salt material becomes saltless, by what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace among each other.

## Mark 10

1. And having risen from there, he comes into the borders of Judea through the other side of the Jordan. And multitudes come together to him again, and, as he has practiced, he taught them again.

2. And the Pharisees having approached, they demanded of him if it is permitted for a man to divorce a wife, testing him.

3. And having answered, he said to them, What did Moses command you?

4. And they said, Moses permitted to write a document of divorce, and to divorce her.

5. But having answered, Jesus said to them, For your hard heart he wrote for you this commandment.

6. But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.

7. Because of this a man will leave his father and mother behind, and will be bonded with his wife,

8. and the two will be in one flesh. So then they are no more two, but one flesh.

9. What therefore God has joined together, no man shall separate.

10. And in the house the disciples questioned him again about the same thing.

11. And he says to them, Whoever may divorce his wife, and will marry another, commits adultery against her.

12. And if a woman should divorce her husband, and will be married to another, she commits adultery.

13. And they brought children to him, so that he would touch them. And the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.

14. But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased, and said to them, Allow the children to come to me. Forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.

15. Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, he will, no, not enter it.

16. And having embraced them, while laying his hands upon them, he blessed them.

17. And as he was going forth on the way, one man having ran to him, and having knelt to him, questioned him, Good teacher, what should I do that I may inherit eternal life?

18. And Jesus said to him, Why do thou call me good? None is good except one, God.

19. Thou know the commandments. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not testify falsely. Thou shall not defraud. Thou shall honor thy father and mother.

20. And having answered, he said to him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth.

21. And having looked at him, Jesus loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lack. Go thou, sell as many things as thou have, and give to the poor, and thou will have treasure in heaven. And after taking up the cross, come, follow me.

22. But having become somber at the saying, he went away sorrowing, for he was a man who has many possessions.

23. And Jesus having looked around, he says to his disciples, How difficultly those who have riches will enter into the kingdom of God.

24. And the disciples were astonished at his words. But again having answered, Jesus says to them, Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God.

25. It is easier for a camel to go through the hole of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And they were exceedingly astonished, saying among themselves, Then who can be saved?

27. And having looked at them, Jesus says, With men, impossible, but not with God. For with God all things are possible.

28. Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.

29. And having answered, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, there is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, because of me, and because of the good news,

30. but he will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands-with persecutions-and in the coming age, eternal life.

31. But many first will be last, and the last first.

32. And they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And again having summoned the twelve, he began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.

33. Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scholars. And they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.

34. And they will mock him, and will scourge, and will spit upon him, and will kill him. And the third day he will rise.

35. And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Teacher, we wish that thou would do for us whatever we ask.

36. And he said to them, What do ye want me to do for you?

37. And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one at thy right hand, and one at thy left hand, in thy glory.

38. But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye are asking. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? And to be immersed the immersion that I am immersed?

39. And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, Ye will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and the immersion that I am immersed ye will be immersed.

40. But to sit at my right hand or at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.

41. And when the ten heard it they began to indignant about James and John.

42. And having summoned them, Jesus says to them, Ye know that those who presume to rule over the Gentiles, lord over them, and their great men have power over them.

43. But it is not so among you. Instead, whoever may want to become great among you, will be your helper,

44. and whoever of you may want to become first, will be a bondman of all.

45. For the Son of man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.

46. And they come to Jericho. And as he went out from Jericho, and his disciples and a considerable crowd, Bartimaeus, the blind son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road begging.

47. And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, thou son of David, be merciful to me.

48. And many rebuked him, that he would be quiet, but he cried out much more, Thou son of David, be merciful to me.

49. And having stood still, Jesus said for him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Cheer up. Arise, he calls thee.

50. And he, having thrown off his garment, having risen, came to Jesus.

51. And having answered, Jesus says to him, What do thou want I would do to thee? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.

52. And Jesus said to him, Go thou, thy faith has healed thee. And straightaway he received his sight, and followed him on the way.

## Mark 11

1. And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,

2. and says to them, Go ye into the village opposite you, and straightaway as ye enter into it, ye will find a colt tied, on which none of men have ever sat. After untying it, bring it.

3. And if any man should say to you, Why are ye doing this? say ye, The Lord has need of it, and straightaway he sends it here.

4. And they departed, and found the colt tied by the door outside in the street, and they untied it.

5. And some of those who stood there said to them, What are ye doing, untying the colt?

6. And they said to them just as Jesus commanded, and they allowed them.

7. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and he sat upon it.

8. And many spread their garments upon the road, and others were cutting branches from the fields, and were spreading on the road.

9. And those who went in front, and those who came behind, cried out saying, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!

10. Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!

11. And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple. And when he looked around on all things, the hour now being evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.

12. And on the morrow when they came out from Bethany he was hungry.

13. And having seen a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps he will find anything on it. And when he came to it he found nothing except leaves, for it was not the time of figs.

14. And having responded, Jesus said to it, No man may eat fruit from thee, no more into the age. And his disciples heard it.

15. And they come to Jerusalem. And having entered into the temple, Jesus began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple. And he overturned the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.

16. And he did not permit that any man might carry a container through the temple.

17. And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But ye made it a den of robbers.

18. And the scholars and the chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him, for they feared him, because all the people were awed at his doctrine.

19. And when it became evening he went forth outside of the city.

20. And passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree dried out from the roots.

21. And having remembered, Peter says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree that thou cursed has been dried out.

22. And having answered, Jesus says to them, Have faith in God.

23. For truly I say to you, that whoever may say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he says comes to pass, whatever he may say will be for him.

24. Because of this I say to you, all things, as many as ye may ask, praying, believe that ye receive, and it will be for you.

25. And whenever ye may stand praying, forgive, if ye have anything against any man, so that also your Father in the heavens will forgive you your trespasses.

26. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father in the heavens forgive your trespasses.

27. And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scholars, and the elders come to him.

28. And they say to him, By what authority are thou doing these things? Or who gave thee this authority so that thou may do these things?

29. And having answering, Jesus said to them, I also will question you one word, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

30. The immersion of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.

31. And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

32. But should we say, From men? (They feared the people, for all held John that he was indeed a prophet.)

33. And having answered, they say to Jesus, We do not know. And having answering, Jesus says to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

## Mark 12

1. And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set up a hedge, and dug a wine vat, and built a tower, and leased it to farmers, and went on a journey.

2. And at the season he sent forth a bondman to the farmers, so that he might receive by the farmers from the fruit of the vineyard.

3. And having seized him, they beat him, and sent him away empty.

4. And again he sent another bondman to them. And that man, having stoned, they wounded in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.

5. And again he sent another, and that man they killed, and many others, beating some, and killing some.

6. Therefore, still having his one beloved son, he also sent him to them, last, saying, They will be made ashamed by my son.

7. But those farmers said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.

8. And having taken him, they killed him, and cast him outside of the vineyard.

9. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.

10. And have ye not read this scripture: The stone that those who build rejected, this came to be into the head of the corner.

11. This happened from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?

12. And they sought to seize him. And they feared the multitude, for they knew that he spoke the parable against them. And having left him, they went away.

13. And they send some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, so that they might catch him in talk.

14. And when they came, they say to him, Teacher, we have seen that thou are true, and it is not a care to thee about any man, for thou look not to a personage of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to give tribute to Caesar or not?

15. Should we give, or should we not give? But Jesus, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do ye test me? Bring me a denarius, so that I may see it.

16. And they brought it. And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.

17. And having answered, Jesus said to them, Render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God. And they marveled at him.

18. And Sadducees come to him, who say there is no resurrection. And they questioned him, saying,

19. Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother dies, and leaves behind a wife, and leaves no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.

20. There were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.

21. And the second took her, and died, neither did he leave seed behind, and the third likewise.

22. And the seven took her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.

23. In the resurrection when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as wife.

24. And having answered, Jesus said to them, Are ye not led astray because of this: not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God?

25. For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as agents in the heavens.

26. But about the dead, that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him at the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

27. He is not the God of the dead, but God of the living. Ye therefore are much misled.

28. And one of the scholars having come, having heard them disputing, knowing that he had answered them well, he questioned him, Which is the first commandment of all?

29. And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, thou Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,

30. and thou shall love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole mind, and from thy whole strength. This is the first commandment.

31. And this second is similar, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.

32. And the scholar said to him, Well, teacher. Thou spoke in truth that he is one, and there is no other but he.

33. And to love him from the whole heart, and from the whole understanding, and from the whole soul, and from the whole strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

34. And when Jesus saw him, that he answered wisely, he said to him, Thou are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man dared to question him any more.

35. And having responded as he taught in the temple, Jesus said, How do the scholars say that the Christ is the son of David?

36. For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The Lord says to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I may place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet.

37. David himself therefore calls him Lord, and in what way is he his son? And the great multitude heard him gladly.

38. And in his teaching he said to them, Look away from the scholars, those who desire to go about in long robes, and salutations in the marketplaces,

39. and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at the feasts,

40. those who devour widows' houses, and praying long in pretence. These will receive greater condemnation.

41. And having sat down opposite the treasury, Jesus watched how the multitude cast money into the treasury, and many rich men cast in much.

42. And one poor widow having come, she cast in two mites, which are a quadrans.

43. And having summoned his disciples, he says to them, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow cast in more than all those who are casting into the treasury.

44. For they all cast in from that which is abundant to them, but she from her need cast in all, as many things she had, her whole living.

## Mark 13

1. And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings.

2. And Jesus having answered, he said to him, See thou these great buildings? There will be left, no, not a stone upon a stone, that will, no, not be brought down.

3. And as he sat upon the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew questioned him privately,

4. Tell us, when will these things be? And what is the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?

5. And having answered them, Jesus began to say to them, Watch that not any man lead you astray.

6. For many will come in my name, saying, I am, and they will lead many astray.

7. And when ye may hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not alarmed, for it must happen, but the end is not yet.

8. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginnings of travails.

9. But watch ye yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and ye will be beaten in synagogues. And ye will be stood before rulers and kings because of me, for a testimony to them.

10. And the good news must first be preached to all the nations.

11. But when they lead you, delivering you up, be not anxious before what ye might speak, nor meditate. But whatever may be given you in that hour, speak ye this, for ye are not who speak, but the Holy Spirit.

12. And brother will betray brother to death, and a father a child. And children will rise up against parents, and will condemn them to death.

13. And ye will be hated by all men because of my name, but he who endures to the end, this man will be saved.

14. But when ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains,

15. and let the man on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter in to take anything out of his house,

16. and let the man who is in the field not turn back for the things behind, to take his cloak.

17. But woe to those who have in the womb, and to those who suckle in those days.

18. And pray ye that your flight may not be in winter.

19. For those days will be tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and no, will not happen.

20. And unless the Lord cut short the days, no flesh would have been saved, but because of the chosen, whom he chose, he cut short the days.

21. And then if any man should say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Lo, there, do not believe.

22. For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will give signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.

23. But watch ye. Behold, I have foretold all to you.

24. But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,

25. and the stars of the sky will be falling, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.

26. And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with much power and glory.

27. And then he will send forth his agents, and will gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the outermost part of the earth as far as the outermost part of heaven.

28. But learn a parable from the fig tree. When its branch now becomes tender, and sprouts the leaves, ye know that summer is near.

29. So ye also, when ye may see these things happening, know ye that it is near, at the doors.

30. Truly I say to you, that this generation will, no, not pass away, until all these things happen.

31. The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words may, no, not pass away.

32. But about that day or that hour no man knows, not even the agents in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.

33. Watch ye! Be alert and pray, for ye know not when the time is,

34. like a man abroad, having left his house, and having given authority to his bondmen, and to each man his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch.

35. Watch therefore, for ye know not when the lord of the house comes, at evening, or at midnight, or at cock crowing, or in the morning,

36. lest having come suddenly, he may find you sleeping.

37. And what I say to you I say to all, watch!

## Mark 14

1. Now after two days was the Passover and the unleavened bread. And the chief priests and the scholars sought how, having take him with trickery, they might kill him,

2. but they said, Not during the feast, lest there will be an uproar of the people.

3. And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat relaxing, a woman came having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure spikenard, very valuable. And having broken the alabaster cruse, she poured it on his head.

4. And some were indignant within themselves, saying, Why has this waste of the ointment happened?

5. For this could have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and given to the poor. And they grumbled at her.

6. But Jesus said, Leave her be. Why do ye cause troubles for her? She performed a good work on me.

7. For ye always have the poor with you, and whenever ye may desire ye can do them well, but ye do not always have me.

8. She applied what she had to anoint my body. She did it beforehand for the burial.

9. And truly I say to you, wherever this good news may be preached in the whole world, also what she did will be told for a memorial of her.

10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, so that he might betray him to them.

11. And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might betray him conveniently.

12. And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where do thou want, after going, we should prepare that thou may eat the Passover?

13. And he sends forth two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him.

14. And wherever he may enter, say ye to the house-ruler, The teacher says, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

15. And he himself will show you a large upper room spread out ready. Prepare ye for us there.

16. And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found just as he had said to them. And they prepared the Passover.

17. And having become evening he comes with the twelve.

18. And as they were relaxing and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, that one of you eating with me will betray me.

19. They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Not I? and another, Not I?

20. And having answered, he said to them, It is one of the twelve dipping with me in the dish.

21. The Son of man indeed goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It was good for him if that man was not born.

22. And as they were eating, Jesus having taken bread, having blessed, he broke in pieces, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat, this is my body.

23. And after taking the cup, having expressed thanks, he gave to them, and they all drank from it.

24. And he said to them, This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.

25. Truly I say to you, that I will no more drink of the fruit of the grapevine, until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.

26. And when they sang a hymn, they went out onto the mount of Olives.

27. And Jesus says to them, All ye will be caused to stumble by me this night, because it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.

28. But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.

29. But Peter said to him, Even if all will be caused to stumble, yet not I.

30. And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee, that thou today, in this night, before a cock sounds twice, will deny me thrice.

31. But he spoke more extreme, If I must die with thee, I will, no, not deny thee. And they all spoke the same way also.

32. And they come to a place the name of which was Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples, Sit ye here until I pray.

33. And he takes Peter and James and John with him, and began to be greatly disturbed, and very distressed.

34. And he says to them, My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain ye here, and watch.

35. And having gone forward a little, he fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.

36. And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee. Remove this cup from me, but not what I want, but what thou want.

37. And he comes and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, Simon, Do thou sleep? Could thou not watch one hour?

38. Watch ye and pray that ye may not enter into temptation. Truly, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

39. And again having departed, he prayed, having said the same statement.

40. And having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down, and they knew not what they should reply to him.

41. And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep the remaining, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

42. Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me has come near.

43. And straightaway, while he still spoke, Judas, being one of the twelve, comes, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests, and the scholars, and the elders.

44. Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss is he. Seize him, and lead away securely.

45. And when he came, straightaway having approached him, he says, Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him much.

46. And they threw their hands on him, and seized him.

47. And a certain one of those who stood by, having drawn his sword, struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

48. And having answered, Jesus said to them, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest me?

49. I was daily near you, teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me-but that the scriptures might be fulfilled.

50. And having forsook him, they all fled.

51. And a certain one young man followed with him, having been wrapped naked in a linen cloth. And the young men seized him,

52. but having left behind the linen cloth, he fled from them naked.

53. And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scholars assemble with him.

54. And Peter followed him from a distance, as far as inside the courtyard of the high priest, and was sitting with the subordinates, and warming himself near the light.

55. Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, and did not find it.

56. For many testified falsely against him, and their testimonies were not consistent.

57. And some men having stood up, testified falsely against him, saying,

58. We heard him saying, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and by three days I will build another not made with hands.

59. And not even this way was their testimony consistent.

60. And the high priest having stood up in the midst, he demanded Jesus, saying, Thou answer nothing? What is it these men testify against thee?

61. But he remained silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest demanded him, and says to him, Are thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?

62. And Jesus said, I am. And ye will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.

63. And the high priest having torn his clothes, he says, What further need have we of witnesses?

64. Ye have heard the blasphemy. What does it seem to you? And they all condemned him to be deserving of death.

65. And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him with a fist, and to say to him, Prophesy. And the subordinates were throwing him with slaps.

66. And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest comes.

67. And having seen Peter warming himself, having looked at him, she says, Thou also were with Jesus of Nazareth.

68. But he denied, saying, I know not, nor understand what thou say. And he went outside onto the porch, and a cock sounded.

69. And the servant girl having seen him, she began again to say to those who stood by, This man is from them.

70. But he again denied it. And after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, Surely thou are from them, for thou are a Galilean, and thy accent is similar.

71. But he began to curse and to swear, I do not know this man of whom ye speak.

72. And the second time a cock sounded. And Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him, Before a cock sounds twice, thou will deny me thrice. And having broke down, he wept.

## Mark 15

1. And straightaway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scholars and the whole council, having made a plan, after binding Jesus, they took him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.

2. And Pilate questioned him, Are thou the king of the Jews? And having answered, he said to him, Thou say.

3. And the chief priests accused him of many things.

4. And Pilate again questioned him, saying, Thou answer nothing? Behold how many things they testify against thee.

5. But Jesus answered nothing any more, so as for Pilate to wonder.

6. Now during a feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they requested.

7. And a man who was called Barabbas was with the rebels who were bound, men who had committed murder during the insurrection.

8. And having cried aloud, the multitude began to ask as he was always doing for them.

9. And Pilate answered them, saying, Do ye wish that I would release to you the king of the Jews?

10. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up because of envy.

11. But the chief priests incited the crowd, so that he would release Barabbas to them instead.

12. And again having answered, Pilate said to them, What then do ye wish I would do to the man whom ye call the king of the Jews?

13. And they cried out again, Crucify him.

14. And Pilate said to them, For what evil has he done? But they cried out even more, Crucify him.

15. And Pilate, wanting to do what was sufficient for the crowd, released Barabbas to them. And he delivered Jesus, after scourging, so that he might be crucified.

16. And the soldiers led him away inside the courtyard, which is the Praetorium, and they call together the whole band.

17. And they put purple clothing on him, and clothe him with a woven crown of thorns,

18. and began to salute him, Hail, king of the Jews!

19. And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshiped him.

20. And when they had mocked him, they took the purple garment off of him, and dressed him with his own garments. And they lead him out so that they might crucify him.

21. And they draft a certain Simon, a Cyrenian passing by coming from the countryside, the father of Alexander and Rufus, so that he would take his cross.

22. And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull.

23. And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it.

24. And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting a lot for them, who would take what.

25. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

26. And the inscription of his accusation was inscribed, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27. And they crucify two robbers with him, one at his right hand, and one at his left.

28. And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was reckoned with lawless men.

29. And those who passed by railed at him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,

30. save thyself, and come down from the cross.

31. Likewise also the chief priests mocking among each other with the scholars said, He saved others, he cannot save himself.

32. Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe in him. And those who were crucified with him reviled him.

33. And having become the sixth hour, darkness occurred over the whole land until the ninth hour.

34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a great voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?

35. And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah.

36. And one having ran, and having filled a sponge of vinegar, and having placed it on a reed, gave him to drink, saying, Leave be. We might see if Elijah comes to take him down.

37. And having given out a great voice, Jesus expired.

38. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.

39. And when the centurion, who stood from opposite him, saw that he expired, having cried out this way, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

40. And there were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were also Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the small man, and of Joses, and Salome;

41. women who also followed him and served him when he was in Galilee, also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.

42. And now having become evening, since it was the Preparation, that is, pre-sabbath,

43. Joseph of Arimathaea came, an honorable councilman who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God, emboldened, he went in near Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus.

44. And Pilate wondered if he died already. And having summoned the centurion, he questioned him if he was already dead.

45. And having ascertained from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

46. And having bought fine linen, and having taken him down, he wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher, being that which had been hewn out of rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.

47. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

## Mark 16

1. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that having come, they might anoint him.

2. And very much early morning on the first day of the week, they come near to the sepulcher when the sun was risen.

3. And they said to themselves, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulcher?

4. And having looked, they see that the stone has been rolled back, for it was very large.

5. And having entered into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.

6. And he says to them, Be not alarmed. Ye seek Jesus, the man of Nazareth who was crucified. He was raised. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him.

7. But go, tell his disciples and Peter, that he goes before you into Galilee. Ye will see him there, just as he said to you.

8. And having come out, they fled from the sepulcher, and trembling and astonishment seized them. And they said nothing to any man, for they were afraid.

9. Now having risen early morning on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.

10. That woman, having gone, informed those who became with him, as they mourned and wept.

11. And those men, when they heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.

12. And after these things he appeared in a different form to two of them as they walked going into the countryside.

13. And those men having departed, they reported to the others. Neither did they believe those men.

14. Afterward he became visible to them, to the eleven, who were relaxing. And he upbraided their unbelief and hard heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he was raised.

15. And he said to them, Having gone into all the world, preach ye the good news to the whole creation.

16. He who believes and is immersed will be saved, but he who does not believe will be damned.

17. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new tongues.

18. They will take up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it will, no, not harm them. They will lay hands on the feeble, and they will fare well.

19. Therefore indeed, the Lord, after he spoke to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.

20. And those men, having gone forth, they preached everywhere, the Lord working jointly, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Truly.
