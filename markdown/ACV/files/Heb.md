# Hebrews

## Hebrews 1

1. God, who formerly spoke in many portions and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets, spoke to us in these last days by a Son,

2. whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the ages.

3. Who, being the radiance of his glory, and the exact image of his essence, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made purification of our sins through himself, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in the heights.

4. Having become so much better than the agents, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they.

5. For to which of the agents did he ever say, Thou are my Son, today I have begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for a Father, and he will be to me for a Son?

6. And again when he brings the firstborn into the world he says, And let all the agents of God worship him.

7. And indeed toward the agents he says, He who makes his agents spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.

8. But toward the Son, Thy throne, O God, is into the age of the age. The scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of straightness.

9. Thou have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Because of this, God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.

10. And thou, Lord, at the beginnings founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.

11. They will perish, but thou are permanent. And they will all become old as a garment.

12. And thou will roll them up as a mantle, and they will be changed. But thou are the same, and thy years will not cease.

13. But to which of the agents has he ever said, Sit thou by my right hand until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet?

14. Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for service for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?

## Hebrews 2

1. Because of this we ought to give more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest we might slip away.

2. For if the word spoken through agents became certain, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,

3. how will we escape, having neglected so great a salvation? Which first, having taken to be spoken by the Lord, was verified for us by those who heard;

4. God also testifying simultaneously by signs and wonders, and by various powers and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.

5. For he did not subject the coming world to agents, about which we speak.

6. But a certain man has somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou remember him? Or a son of man, that thou help him?

7. Thou made him a little something less than the agents. Thou crowned him with glory and honor.

8. Thou subordinated all things under his feet. For in subordinating all things to him, he left nothing not subordinate to him. But now we do not yet see all things subordinated to him.

9. But we see Jesus who has been made a little something less than the agents, who, because of the suffering of death, has been crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God he would taste of death for every man.

10. For it was fitting for him, through whom are all things, and because of whom are all things, having brought many sons to glory, to make the pathfinder of their salvation fully perfect through sufferings.

11. For both he who sanctifies and those being sanctified are all of one, because of which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,

12. saying, I will declare thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to thee.

13. And again, I will be a man who has trusted in him. And again, Behold, I and the children that God has given me.

14. Since therefore the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might make him who has the power of death impotent, that is, the devil.

15. And he might liberate these, as many as throughout all their lifetime were deserving of bondage, with a specter of death.

16. For he certainly did not embrace agents, but he embraced the seed of Abraham.

17. Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in accordance with all things, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things toward God, in order to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

18. For in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help those being tempted.

## Hebrews 3

1. Because of which, holy brothers, companions of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our affirmation, Jesus Christ,

2. who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.

3. For this man was considered worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he who built it has more esteem than the house.

4. For every house is built by some man, but he who built all things is God.

5. And Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of the things that were going to be spoken,

6. but Christ as a Son over his house, whose house we are, if only we keep in possession our confidence and pride of hope, firm until the end.

7. Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if ye hear his voice,

8. do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, according to the day of the trial in the wilderness,

9. where your fathers challenged me, tested me, and saw my works forty years.

10. Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, They are always led astray in their heart, and they did not know my ways.

11. So I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest.

12. Watch, brothers, lest there will be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God.

13. But exhort each other during each day, while it is called Today, lest any of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

14. For we have become companions of the Christ, if only we keep in possession the primacy of the essence, steadfast until the end,

15. while it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.

16. For some who heard rebelled, but not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses.

17. But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?

18. And to whom did he swear were not going to enter into his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?

19. And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.

## Hebrews 4

1. Let us be afraid therefore, lest, a promise being left behind to enter into his rest, any of you should seem to have come short.

2. For we also are having good news preached, just as also those men, but the word of hearing did not benefit those men, not having been mixed together with faith in those who heard.

3. For those who believe enter into that rest, just as he said, So I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest, although the works occurred from the foundation of the world.

4. For he spoke somewhere about the seventh this way, And God rested during the seventh day from all his works,

5. and in this again, They will not enter into my rest.

6. Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and those who formerly had good news did not enter because of disobedience,

7. again he appoints a certain day, Today, saying in David after so long a time (as it is said), Today if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.

8. For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things.

9. There remains therefore a sabbath for the people of God.

10. For a man who has entered into his rest, he has also rested from his works, as God did from his own.

11. Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest, so that not any man may fall by the same example of disobedience.

12. For the word of God is living, and potent, and sharper, above every two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division both of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and discernible of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

13. And there is no creature concealed from his presence, but all things are naked and vulnerable to his eyes, before whom is the word to us.

14. Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us take hold of the affirmation.

15. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who was tempted in all things in the same way, without sin.

16. Let us therefore come near with boldness to the throne of grace, so that we may take mercy, and may find grace for timely help.

## Hebrews 5

1. For every high priest taken from men is appointed for men in things toward God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.

2. Who can be gentle to those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself is also encompassed with weakness.

3. And because of this he is obligated, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.

4. And not any man takes the honor to himself, but being called by God, just as also Aaron.

5. So also Christ did not glorify himself to become a high priest, but it was he who said to him, Thou are my Son, today I have begotten thee.

6. (And just as he says in another, Thou are a priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.)

7. Who, in the days of his flesh, having offered up both prayers and supplications with strong shouting and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and who was heard because of his reverence,

8. although being a Son, he learned obedience from the things that he suffered.

9. And having been fully perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,

10. having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.

11. About whom, much subject matter from us is also difficult to explain, since ye have become sluggish in hearing.

12. For also men who ought to be teachers because of the time, ye have need again for some man to teach you the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become men who have need of milk, and not of solid food.

13. For every man partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is childlike.

14. But solid food is for mature men, those having their sensibilities trained through practice for the discernment of both good and evil.

## Hebrews 6

1. Therefore having left the word of the primacy of Christ, let us be brought forward to perfection, not again laying a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

2. of doctrine of washings, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

3. And this we will do, if of course God will permit.

4. For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and who tasted of the heavenly gift, and who became partakers of the Holy Spirit,

5. and who tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,

6. and who fell away, to restore again to repentance, crucifying to themselves the Son of God, and disgracing him publicly.

7. For the soil that has drunk the rain often coming upon it, and bringing forth vegetation useful for those by whom also it is cultivated, partakes of a blessing from God.

8. But producing thorns and thistles it is unfit and near a curse, the end of which is for burning.

9. But we are persuaded better things about you, beloved, and things that have salvation, even though we speak this way.

10. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labor of love that ye showed toward his name, having served the sanctified, and who are serving.

11. And we earnestly desire each of you to show the same diligence toward the full assurance of the hope until the end,

12. so that ye may not become lazy, but imitators of those who, through faith and longsuffering, inherit the promises.

13. For God who promised to Abraham, since he had none greater to swear by, swore by himself,

14. saying, Surely indeed, blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

15. And this way, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

16. For men certainly swear by the greater, and of every dispute with them the oath is final for confirmation.

17. By which God, wanting to demonstrate more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutableness of his resolve, confirmed it by an oath.

18. So that by two immutable events, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, having fled for refuge to seize the hope being openly displayed.

19. Which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and that enters into the interior of the veil,

20. where the forerunner, Jesus, entered for us, having become a high priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.

## Hebrews 7

1. For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, having met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, also blessed him.

2. To whom also Abraham divided a tenth of all. Being actually translated, first, king of righteousness, and then also, king of Salem, which is king of peace,

3. without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.

4. And notice how great this man was, to whom also the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the best spoils.

5. Now indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have commandment to collect tithes from the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, although having come out of the loins of Abraham.

6. But the man who did not descend from them has received tithes from Abraham, and has blessed the man having the promises.

7. And without all contradiction the inferior is blessed by the superior.

8. And here indeed, men who die receive tithes, but there, he who is testified about that he lives.

9. And, so to speak, Levi also, the man who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham,

10. for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.

11. If indeed therefore perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people had received the law), what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?

12. For the priesthood being changed, of necessity a change of law also occurs.

13. For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, from which no man has attended to the altar.

14. For it is evident that our Lord arose out of Judah, regarding which tribe Moses spoke nothing about the priesthood.

15. And it is still far more evident, if according to the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest,

16. who has become, not according to a law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indestructible life.

17. For he testifies, Thou are a priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.

18. For indeed there becomes an annulment of a preceding commandment because of its weakness and uselessness

19. (for the law made nothing fully perfect), and an introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God.

20. And inasmuch as it is not without an oath. For actually those who become priests are so without an oath,

21. but he with an oath, because of him who says to him, The Lord swore and will not change his mind, Thou are a priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.

22. By so much, Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant.

23. And of course those who have become priests are more, because of being prevented to continue by death,

24. but he, because of his remaining into the age, has the priesthood unchangeable.

25. Whereupon he is able also to save to the uttermost those who come to God through him, being always alive in order to intercede on their behalf.

26. For such a high priest is fitting for us, devout, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become higher than the heavens.

27. Who has no need to offer up sacrifices each day, as those high priests, first for his own sins, then for those of the people, for this he did, once, when he offered up himself.

28. For the law appoints men high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath after the law, a Son who has been fully perfected into the age.

## Hebrews 8

1. Now a summation about the things being spoken is, we have such a high priest who was seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,

2. a minister of the holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord erected and not man.

3. For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices, whereupon it is necessary for this man also to have something that he may offer.

4. For certainly if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, there being the priests who offer the gifts according to the law,

5. who serve for an example and shadow of the heavenly things. Just as Moses who was divinely warned while going to complete the tabernacle, for he says, See thou make all things according to the pattern that was shown thee on the mountain.

6. But now he has obtained a superior ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a superior covenant, which has been enacted upon superior promises.

7. For if that first one was faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.

8. For, finding fault with them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, and I will perfect a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.

9. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by my hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.

10. Because this is the covenant that I will ordain with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws into their mind, and I will write them on their hearts. And I will be to them for a God, and they will be to me for a people.

11. And they will, no, not teach each man his fellow citizen, and each man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, because all will know me, from their small as far as their great.

12. Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their lawlessness I will no, not further remember.

13. In saying, New, he has made the first old. And what is becoming old and obsolete is near disappearance.

## Hebrews 9

1. Now indeed therefore the first had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary.

2. For a tabernacle was prepared, the first in which was also the lampstand, and the table, and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the Holy place.

3. And behind the second curtain, the tabernacle called the Holy of holies,

4. having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid entirely in gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.

5. And above it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of forgiveness, about which things it is not now to speak in detail.

6. And these things thus having been prepared, the priests indeed enter into the first part of the tabernacle continually, accomplishing the services.

7. But into the second part, the high priest alone, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people,

8. this signifying from the Holy Spirit, the way into the holy things is not yet to be made known while the first tabernacle still remains.

9. Which is a figure for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered that are not able to make the man officiating fully perfect in respect to conscience,

10. only in foods and drinks and various washings: carnal ordinances imposed until a time of reformation.

11. But Christ, having arrived a high priest of the good things that are coming, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,

12. and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, he entered in once into the Holy things, having found eternal redemption.

13. For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling those who were defiled, sanctifies for the purification of the flesh,

14. how much more the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself unblemished to God, will cleanse your conscience from dead works in order to serve a living God?

15. And because of this he is mediator of a new covenant, so that a death having occurred for the redemption of the transgressions against the first covenant, those who are called might take the promise of the eternal inheritance.

16. For where a covenant is, a necessity is to present the death of the man who made the covenant.

17. For a covenant is effective with the dead, since it is never enforced while the man who made the covenant lives.

18. Whereupon neither has the first been dedicated without blood.

19. For of every commandment according to law that was spoken by Moses to all the people, after taking the blood of the calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,

20. saying, This is the blood of the covenant that God made for you.

21. And likewise he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service.

22. And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood, and remission does not occur without bloodshed.

23. Indeed therefore, a necessity was for the models of the things in the heavens themselves to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things with better sacrifices than these.

24. For the Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, representative of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.

25. And not so that he might offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the Holy things each year with blood by another,

26. since it would be necessary for him to suffer often, from the foundation of the world. But now once, at the end of the ages, he was made known for an annulment of sin by the sacrifice of himself.

27. And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this, judgment,

28. so also the Christ, having been offered once in order to take up the sins of many, will appear a second time, independent of sin, to those waiting for him for salvation.

## Hebrews 10

1. For the law having a shadow of the good things that are coming, not the same substance of the events, with the same sacrifices that are offered continually each year, they are never able to fully perfect those who are approaching.

2. Otherwise would they not have ceased being offered, because of those who worship, once having been cleansed, to have no further conscience of sins?

3. But in them is a reminder of sins each year.

4. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

5. Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering thou did not desire, but thou prepared for me a body.

6. In whole burnt offerings, and for sin thou were not pleased.

7. Then I said, Lo, I come (in the volume of a book it is written about me) to do thy will, O God,

8. saying above, Sacrifice and offering and whole burnt offerings and for sin thou did not desire, nor were thou pleased with things that are offered according to the law.

9. Then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He takes away the first, so that he may establish the second.

10. By which will we are sanctified through the one time offering of the body of Jesus Christ.

11. And indeed every priest stands daily serving and offering the same sacrifices often, which can never take away sins.

12. But this man, having offered one sacrifice on behalf of sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,

13. waiting henceforth until his enemies are placed a footstool of his feet.

14. For by one offering he has fully perfected forever those being sanctified.

15. And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, after indeed foretelling,

16. This is the covenant that I will ordain with them after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws on their hearts, and on their minds I will write them,

17. and, Their sins and their lawlessness I will, no, not further remember.

18. Now where there is remission of these, there is no more offering for sin.

19. Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entrance into the holy things by the blood of Jesus,

20. which he inaugurated for us, a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh,

21. and a great priest over the house of God,

22. let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body washed in pure water.

23. Let us hold firm the affirmation of the hope unwavering, for he who promised is faithful.

24. And let us examine each other for provocation of love and good works.

25. Not forsaking the assembling together of ourselves, as is the habit of some, but exhorting, and so much the more as long as ye see the day approaching.

26. For when we sin willfully after taking the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,

27. but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and of fire, a fervor that is going to devour the opposition.

28. Any man who has disregarded the law of Moses dies without mercies from two or three witnesses.

29. By how much worse punishment do ye think he will deserve who has trampled the Son of God, and who considered profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who treated the Spirit of grace contemptuously?

30. For we know him who said, Vengeance is for me, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.

31. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

32. But remember the former days, in which, after being enlightened, ye endured a great contest of sufferings,

33. partly made a spectacle, both by reviling and afflictions, and partly having become companions of those so treated.

34. For ye were both compassionate about my bonds, and ye accepted with joy the plundering of your possessions, knowing yourselves to have a superior and an enduring existence in the heavens.

35. Therefore do not throw off your boldness, which has great recompense of reward.

36. For ye have need of perseverance, so that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.

37. For yet a very little while, he who is coming will come, and will not delay.

38. But the righteous man will live from faith, and if he should withdraw, my soul is not pleased with him.

39. But we are not of retreat for destruction, but of faith for the preservation of the soul.

## Hebrews 11

1. Now faith is the foundation of hoping, the evidence of events not being seen.

2. For by this the ancients were well reported.

3. By faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by the word of God. For the things that are seen do not come to be from that which is visible.

4. By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, because of which he was reported to be righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through it, he who died still speaks.

5. By faith Enoch was transferred to not see death, and he was not found, because God transferred him. For before his removal he was reported to be pleasing to God.

6. And apart from faith it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must believe that he is, and becomes a rewarder of those who search for him.

7. By faith Noah, being divinely warned about things not yet seen, moved with awe, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became an heir of righteousness according to faith.

8. By faith Abraham, when called, obeyed to go out to the place that he was going to take for an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.

9. By faith he lived alien in the land of promise as a foreigner, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise.

10. For he anticipated the city that has the foundations, whose builder and architect is God.

11. By faith even Sarah herself received power for conception of seed, and she gave birth beyond the time of age, because she considered him faithful who promised.

12. And therefore from one man, and these things having become deadened, were begotten as the stars of the heaven for multitude, and as the sand of the seashore, countless.

13. All these died in faith, not having taken the promises, but who saw and greeted them from afar, and who confessed that they were foreigners and sojourners on the earth.

14. For those who say such things show that they are seeking a fatherland.

15. And if indeed they remembered that from which they came out, they would have had time to return.

16. But now they aspire for a superior one, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.

17. By faith Abraham, being tested, offered Isaac. And he who received the promises offered his only begotten son,

18. about whom it was said, The seed by thee will be called in Isaac.

19. Having reckoned that God is able to raise up even from the dead, from where also, in a figure, he did receive him back.

20. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau about things coming.

21. By faith Jacob, while dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and bowed in worship upon the top of his staff.

22. By faith Joseph, while perishing, remembered about the exodus of the sons of Israel, and commanded about his bones.

23. By faith Moses, after being born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child well-formed, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.

24. By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,

25. having chosen rather to be mistreated with the people of God, than to have the pleasure of sin temporarily.

26. Having esteemed the vilification of the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he focused toward the recompense of reward.

27. By faith he forsook Egypt, not having feared the wrath of the king, for he persevered as seeing the invisible.

28. By faith he performed the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who was destroying the firstborn would not touch them.

29. By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land, of which the Egyptians, having taken an attempt, were drowned.

30. By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, having been encircled for seven days.

31. By faith Rahab the harlot was not destroyed with those who were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.

32. And what shall I say further? For the time would fail me telling about Gideon, also Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets,

33. who, through faith, conquered kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, closed the mouths of lions,

34. quenched the force of fire, escaped the jaw of the sword. Out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, bowed down armies of aliens.

35. Women took hold of their dead from a resurrection, but others were tortured, not having accepted deliverance, so that they might experience a superior resurrection.

36. And others took a trial of mockings and scourgings, and moreover of bonds and imprisonment.

37. They were stoned, they were sawed apart, they were tempted, they died in murder by sword. They wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, restricted, tormented

38. (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.

39. And all these, having been well reported through faith, did not receive the promise,

40. God having foreseen something superior concerning us, so that without us they would not be made fully perfect.

## Hebrews 12

1. Therefore we also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, having put off every weight and cleverly entangling sin, let us run by perseverance the contest being set before us.

2. Looking to Jesus the pathfinder and perfecter of the faith, who, against the joy set before him, endured a cross, having despised the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

3. For consider the man who endured such hostility against him by sinners, so that ye may not be weary in your souls, being disheartened.

4. Ye have not yet resisted as far as blood, struggling against sin.

5. And have ye forgotten the exhortation that reasons with you as with sons, My son, do not disparage the chastening of the Lord, nor become disheartened when punished by him?

6. For whom the Lord loves he chastens. And he whips every son whom he receives.

7. Because of chastening ye endure; God is treating you as with sons, for what son is there whom a father does not chasten?

8. And if ye are without chastening, of which all have become participants, then ye are bastards, and not sons.

9. Besides, we indeed have had chastisers-the fathers of our flesh-and we were turned around. Shall we not much more be subordinate to the Father of the spirits, and we will live?

10. For those men indeed for a few days chastened us according to that which seemed good to them, but he for that which is advantageous, in order to be partakers of his holiness.

11. But of course no chastening for the present seems to be of joy but of sorrow, yet afterward it yields peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.

12. Therefore lift up the drooping hands, and the feeble knees,

13. and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be turned away, but may be healed instead.

14. Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord.

15. Looking carefully lest any man fall short, away from the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness sprouting up would cause trouble, and by this many may be defiled,

16. lest a fornicator or profane man like Esau, who, in place of one meal sold his birthright.

17. For ye also know that wanting afterward to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though having sought it with tears.

18. For ye have not come to a mountain being felt, and which burned with fire, and to darkness, and gloom, and a tempest,

19. and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of words, of which those who heard begged that a word not be added to them.

20. For they did not bear that which was commanded, if even a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.

21. And so fearful was that which was made visible, that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.

22. But ye have come to mount Zion, and to the city of a living God, a heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of agents,

23. to a festal gathering and assembly of firstborn sons who were enrolled in the heavens, and to God, a Judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men who were made fully perfect,

24. and to Jesus a mediator of a new covenant, and to blood of sprinkling that speaks better than Abel.

25. Watch, that ye not refuse him who speaks. For if those men did not escape, having refused him who spoke a divine message on earth, much more we, those who turn away from him from the heavens,

26. whose voice then shook the earth. But now he has promised, saying, Yet once, I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.

27. And the, Yet once, signifies the removal of the things being shaken-as of things that were made-so that the things not being shaken may remain.

28. Therefore, receiving an immovable kingdom, we may have grace, through which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and awe.

29. For our God is also a consuming fire.

## Hebrews 13

1. Let brotherly love abide.

2. Do not forget love for strangers, for by this some lodged agents, unaware.

3. Remember the prisoners as being in bondage together, those who are ill-treated as also yourselves being in the body.

4. Marriage is precious in every way, and the undefiled bed, but God will judge fornicators and adulterers.

5. The Way of life is to be without love of money, being content with the things that are present, for he has said, I will, no, not leave thee, and also, I will, no, not forsake thee.

6. So then we have confidence to say, The Lord is a helper to me, and I will not fear. What will man do to me?

7. Remember those who lead you, men who spoke the word of God to you, of whom, carefully observing the outcome of their conduct, imitate the faith-

8. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today, and into the ages.

9. Be not carried away by various and foreign doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established with grace, not with foods by which those who walked were not benefited.

10. We have an altar from which they have no right to eat, those officiating at the tabernacle.

11. For of the beasts whose blood is brought into the holy things for sin by the high priest, the bodies of these are burned outside the camp.

12. Therefore Jesus also, so that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside the gate.

13. Let us therefore go forth to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.

14. For here we have no enduring city, but we seek that which is coming.

15. Through him therefore, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, fruit of lips acknowledging his name.

16. But do not forget benevolence and fellowship, for God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

17. Have confidence in those who lead you, and yield yourselves, for they watch for your souls as men who will render account, so that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this is unprofitable for you.

18. Pray about us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, desiring to behave well in all things.

19. But I urge you to do this even more, so that I may be restored to you sooner.

20. Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep by the blood of an eternal covenant-our Lord Jesus-

21. may he make you fully qualified in every good work in order to do his will, doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.

22. And I urge you, brothers, bear with the word of exhortation, for I also wrote to you in brief.

23. Know ye, brother Timothy who was set free is with whom I will see you, if he comes sooner.

24. Salute all those who lead you, and all the sanctified. The men from Italy salute you.

25. Grace is with you all. Truly.
