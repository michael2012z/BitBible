# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the sanctified who are at Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly things in Christ.

4. Just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, for us to be holy and unblemished before him in love.

5. Who predestined us for sonship through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the desire of his will,

6. for appreciation of the glory of his grace, by which he blessed us in him who is beloved.

7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of transgressions, according to the wealth of his grace,

8. which he abounded for us in all wisdom and intelligence.

9. Having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his desire, which he purposed within himself

10. for an administration of the fullness of the times. To gather together all things in the Christ, things in the heavens and things upon the earth,

11. in him in whom also we obtained an inheritance. Having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the deliberation of his will,

12. for us to be for appreciation of his glory, men who have first hoped in the Christ.

13. In whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the good news of your salvation, in whom also having believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,

14. which is a pledge of our inheritance, for the redemption of the acquired possession, for appreciation of his glory.

15. Because of this I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love for all the sanctified,

16. I cease not expressing thanks for you, making remembrance of you in my prayers.

17. So that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in knowledge of him,

18. having the eyes of your heart enlightened. For you to know what is the hope of his calling, and what is the wealth of the glory of his inheritance in the sanctified,

19. and what is the transcending greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of the dominion of his might,

20. which he wrought in the Christ, having raised him from the dead and seated at his right hand in the heavenly things,

21. far above every principle office, and position of authority, and power, and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming.

22. And he subordinated all things under his feet, and appointed him head over all things for the church,

23. which is his body, the fulfillment of him who fills all in all.

## Ephesians 2

1. Even you, who were dead in trespasses and sins

2. in which ye once walked according to the era of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the sons of disobedience.

3. Among whom we also all once behaved in the lusts of our flesh, doing the intentions of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath as also the others.

4. But God, being rich in mercy, through his great love that he loved us,

5. even us being dead in the transgressions, he made alive together with the Christ (ye are saved by grace),

6. and raised us up together, and seated us together in the heavenly things in Christ Jesus.

7. So that in the coming ages he might show the transcending wealth of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

8. For ye are saved by grace through faith, and this a gift of God, not from you,

9. not from works, so that not any man may boast.

10. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God preordained that we should walk in them.

11. Remember therefore that once ye, the Gentiles in flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision (in flesh, made by hands),

12. that ye were at that time independent of Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and alien of the covenants of the promise, having no hope and godless in the world.

13. But now in Christ Jesus ye, being formerly far off, became near in the blood of the Christ.

14. For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the dividing wall of partition,

15. having abolished in his flesh the enmity-the law of the commandments in ordinances-so that he might create in himself the two into one new man, making peace,

16. and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.

17. And after coming he preached good news, peace to you, to those far off and to those near,

18. because through him we both have the access in one Spirit to the Father.

19. So then ye are no more alien and foreign, but fellow citizens of the sanctified, and belonging to the household of God.

20. Which was built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner,

21. in whom the whole building joined together grows into a holy temple in the Lord,

22. in whom ye also are built together in Spirit into a habitation of God.

## Ephesians 3

1. For this reason I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,

2. since indeed ye heard of the administration of the grace of God, which was given to me for you,

3. that according to revelation he made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.

4. With which reading ye can recognize my understanding in the mystery of the Christ,

5. which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets.

6. For Gentiles to be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and fellow partakers of his promise in the Christ through the good news.

7. Of which I became a helper according to the gift of that grace of God, which was given to me according to the working of his power.

8. To me, a man less than the least of all the sanctified, this grace was given to preach good news among the Gentiles, the unsearchable wealth of Christ,

9. and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery hidden from the ages in God who created all things through Jesus Christ.

10. So that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principal offices and the positions of authority in the heavenly things, through the church,

11. according to the purpose of the ages, which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord,

12. in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through his faith.

13. Therefore I ask that ye not become discouraged at my tribulations on your behalf, which is your glory.

14. For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

15. from whom every patriarchy in heavens and on earth is named.

16. So that he would grant you, according to the wealth of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his Spirit for the inner man,

17. for the Christ to dwell in your hearts through faith,

18. having been rooted and grounded in love, so that ye may be able to grasp with all the sanctified what is the breadth and length and depth and height,

19. and to become aware of the love of the Christ, which transcends knowledge, so that ye may be filled in all the fullness of God.

20. Now to him who is able to do above extraordinary-above all things that we ask or think-according to the power that works in us,

21. to him is the glory in the church in Christ Jesus for all generations of the age of the ages. Truly.

## Ephesians 4

1. I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, call on you to walk worthily of the calling in which ye were called,

2. with all humility and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing each other in love.

3. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,

4. one body, and one Spirit. Just as also ye were called in one hope of your calling,

5. one Lord, one faith, one immersion,

6. one God and Father of all. He is over all, and through all, and in us all.

7. But the grace was given to each of us, according to the measure of the gift of the Christ.

8. Therefore he says, Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.

9. And what is the ascended, except that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?

10. He who descended is also the same man who ascended high above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.

11. And indeed he gave the apostles, and the prophets, and the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers

12. for the perfecting of the sanctified, for the work of ministry, for edification of the body of the Christ.

13. Until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to a standard of stature of the fullness of the Christ.

14. So that we may no longer be childish, tossed about and carried about by every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in craftiness with the methodology of error.

15. But being truthful in love, we may cause all things to grow for him who is the head-the Christ-

16. from whom the whole body, joined together and united together through every connection of the supply, according to the working of each one part within a standard, makes the growth of the body for the construction of itself by love.

17. This I say therefore, and solemnly declare in the Lord, for you to walk no longer as also the other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,

18. darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the callousness of their heart.

19. Who, having become callous, gave themselves over to licentiousness for the work of all uncleanness in greed.

20. But ye did not so learn the Christ,

21. if indeed ye heard him, and were taught in him, as truth is in Jesus,

22. for you to put off the old man according to your former conduct, the man who is corrupt according to the desires of deceitfulness,

23. and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,

24. and to put on the new man according to God, the man who was created in righteousness and piety of the truth.

25. Therefore having put off falsehood, let each man speak truth with his neighbor, because we are body-parts of each other.

26. Be ye angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,

27. neither give a place to the devil.

28. Let the man who steals steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the good, so that he may have to give to him who has need.

29. Let no corrupt speech go out of your mouth, rather if there is any good word for edification of a need, so that it may give grace to those who hear.

30. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in which ye are sealed for a day of redemption.

31. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and reviling be taken away from you, with all evil.

32. And become good toward each other, compassionate, forgiving each other, even as also God in Christ forgave us.

## Ephesians 5

1. Become ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.

2. And walk in love, as also the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma.

3. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or greed, shall not even be named among you as befits the sanctified,

4. also indecency, and foolish talking or jesting, things not befitting, but thankfulness instead.

5. For ye are men who know this, that no fornicator, or unclean man, or covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God.

6. Let no man deceive you by empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

7. Do not become ye therefore partakers with them.

8. For ye were once darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light

9. (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),

10. proving what is acceptable to the Lord.

11. And do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead even rebuke them.

12. For it is disgusting even to speak of the things happening by them secretly.

13. But all things exposed are revealed by the light, for everything that is seen is light.

14. Therefore he says, Awake, thou who sleep. And arise from the dead, and the Christ will shine upon thee.

15. Therefore watch carefully how ye walk, not as unwise but as wise,

16. redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

17. Because of this do not become foolish, but understanding what is the will of the Lord.

18. And do not become intoxicated with wine, during which is debauchery, but be filled in Spirit,

19. speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and striking strings in your heart to the Lord,

20. expressing thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,

21. submitting yourselves to each other in the fear of Christ.

22. Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord.

23. Because a husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church, and himself the savior of the body.

24. But as the church is subject to the Christ, so also the wives to their own husbands in everything.

25. Husbands, love your own wives even as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it,

26. so that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it with the washing of water by the word,

27. so that he might present it to himself, the glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and unblemished.

28. So ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.

29. For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ the church,

30. because we are parts of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.

31. Separate from this a man will leave his father and mother behind, and will be bonded with his wife, and the two will be in one flesh.

32. This mystery is great, but I speak for Christ and for the church.

33. Nevertheless ye also, each one in particular, shall so love his own wife as himself, and the wife that she fear her husband.

## Ephesians 6

1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

2. Honor thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise,

3. so that it may become well with thee, and thou will be long lasting on the earth.

4. And ye fathers, do not exasperate your children, but rear them in the training and admonition of the Lord.

5. Bondmen, be obedient to the masters according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as to the Christ.

6. Not according to eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as bondmen of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul,

7. bond-serving with goodwill, as to the Lord and not to men.

8. Knowing that whatever good thing each may do, he will receive this from the Lord, whether bondman or freeman.

9. And ye masters, do the same things to them, easing up the threats, knowing also that the master of you yourselves is in the heavens, and there is no partiality from him.

10. Finally my brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.

11. Put on the full armor of God to enable you to stand against the wiles of the devil.

12. Because our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principal offices, against the positions of authority, against the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, against the spiritual things of wickedness in the heavenly things.

13. Because of this take ye up the full armor of God, so that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

14. Stand ye therefore having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,

15. and having shod your feet in preparation of the good news of peace.

16. Above all having taken up the shield of faith, by which ye will be able to quench all the fiery darts of evil.

17. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,

18. praying through every prayer and entreaty at every time in spirit, and being alert in this same thing in all perseverance and entreaty for all the sanctified,

19. and for me, so that utterance may be given to me in boldness in opening my mouth to make known the mystery of the good news,

20. for which I am an ambassador in bondage, so that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

21. But that ye also may know the things concerning me, what I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful helper in the Lord, will make known all things to you.

22. Whom I sent to you for this same thing, so that ye might know the things about us, and that he might encourage your hearts.

23. Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

24. The grace is with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptibility. Truly.
