# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to arrange in order a narration about the deeds that have been brought to fullness among us,

2. just as they delivered them to us, who became from the beginning eyewitnesses and servants of the word,

3. it occurred to me also, having followed closely from the beginning all things accurately, to write to thee in order, eminent Theophilus,

4. so that thou might know the certainty of the declarations about which thou were instructed.

5. It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, named Zacharias, from the division of Abijah, and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, going in all the commandments and righteous things of the Lord blameless.

7. And there was no child to them because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.

8. But it came to pass during his service as a priest in the course of his division in the presence of God,

9. that, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to burn incense after entering into the temple of the Lord.

10. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.

11. And an agent of the Lord became visible to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

12. And Zacharias having seen, was shaken, and fear fell upon him.

13. But the agent said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy plea was heard, and thy wife Elizabeth will bear a son for thee. And thou shall call his name John.

14. And there will be joy and exultation for thee, and many will rejoice at his birth.

15. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he should, no, not drink wine and strong drink. And he will be filled of the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's belly.

16. And he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.

17. And he will go ahead, in front of him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn back the hearts of fathers toward children, and the disobedient in a mentality of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.

18. And Zacharias said to the agent, How will I know this? For I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days.

19. And having answered, the agent said to him, I am Gabriel who stand in the presence of God. And I was sent to speak to thee, and to announce these good news to thee.

20. And behold, thou will be mute, and not able to speak until that day these things will come to pass, because thou did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.

21. And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they wondered during his delay in the temple.

22. And when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was beckoning to them, and remained speechless.

23. And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.

24. And after these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she concealed herself five months, saying,

25. Thus the Lord has done to me during the days in which he looked, to take away my shame among men.

26. Now in the sixth month the agent Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

27. to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.

28. And the agent having come in near her, he said, Hail, thou who are highly favored. The Lord is with thee, thou who are blessed among women.

29. But having seen, she was perplexed at his saying, and was pondering what kind of greeting this might be.

30. And the agent said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou have found favor with God.

31. And behold, thou will conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son. And thou shall call his name JESUS.

32. This man will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David.

33. And he will reign over the house of Jacob into the ages. And of his kingdom there will be no end.

34. And Mary said to the agent, How will this be, since I know not a man?

35. And having answered, the agent said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee. Therefore also the holy thing that is begotten will be called the Son of God.

36. And behold, Elizabeth thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

37. For no word from God will be impossible.

38. And Mary said, Behold the maid-servant of the Lord. May it happen to me according to thy word. And the agent departed from her.

39. And having risen in these days, Mary went with haste into the hill country, into a city of Judah,

40. and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.

41. And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her belly. And Elizabeth was filled of the Holy Spirit,

42. and she exclaimed in a great voice, and said, Blessed are thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy belly.

43. And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?

44. For lo, when the voice of thy greeting happened in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my belly.

45. And blessed is she who believed, because there will be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from the Lord.

46. And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,

47. and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,

48. because he has looked upon the lowliness of his bondmaid. For behold, from henceforth all generations will regard me blessed,

49. because the Mighty has done great things to me. And his name is holy.

50. And his mercy is for generations of generations to those who fear him.

51. He did a mighty work by his arm. He scattered the proud in the mentality of their heart.

52. He brought down potentates from thrones, and raised up lowly men.

53. He filled those who are hungry with good things, and those who are rich he sent away empty.

54. He helped his boy Israel to be reminded of mercy,

55. just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and his seed into the age.

56. And Mary dwelt with her about three months, and returned to her house.

57. Now the time for Elizabeth was fulfilled for her to give birth, and she brought forth a son.

58. And her neighbors and her kinfolk heard that the Lord magnified his mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.

59. And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and they were calling it by the name of his father Zacharias.

60. And his mother having answered, said, No, but he will be called John.

61. And they said to her, There is no man among thy relatives who is called by this name.

62. And they made signs to his father, whatever he wanted to call him.

63. And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.

64. And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue, and he spoke, praising God.

65. And fear developed in all who dwell around them. And all these sayings were talked about in the entire hill country of Judea.

66. And all who heard stored up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. And his father Zacharias was filled of the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

68. Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, because he came to help, and made ransom for his people.

69. And he raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his boy David,

70. just as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,

71. salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us,

72. to do mercy with our fathers, and his holy covenant to be remembered,

73. the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, to give to us,

74. without fear from the hand of our enemies, having been saved to serve him

75. in piety and righteousness before him all the days of our life.

76. And thou, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High. For thou will go ahead, before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways,

77. to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins,

78. because of the bowels of mercy of our God, by which the dayspring from on high came to help us,

79. to give light to those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into a way of peace.

80. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit. And he was in the desolate regions until the day of his manifestation to Israel.

## Luke 2

1. Now it came to pass in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to enroll all the world.

2. This enrollment first occurred when Quirinius was governor of Syria.

3. And all went to be enrolled, each into his personal city.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and patriarchy of David,

5. to enroll himself with Mary, the woman who was betrothed to him, being pregnant.

6. And it came to pass while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to bring forth.

7. And she brought forth her son, the firstborn, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in the feed trough, because there was no place for them in the inn.

8. And there were shepherds in the same region living in the fields, and keeping watch by night over their flock.

9. And behold, an agent of the Lord stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them. And they feared a great fear.

10. And the agent said to them, Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be to all the people,

11. because to you was born today in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ Lord.

12. And this is the sign to you: Ye will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a feed trough.

13. And suddenly there came to be with the agent a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,

14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill among men.

15. And it came to pass, as the agents went away from them into heaven, that the men (the shepherds) said to each other, Let us indeed go through as far as Bethlehem, and see this declaration that has come to pass, which the Lord made known to us.

16. And having hastened, they came and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the feed trough.

17. And when they saw it, they informed about the declaration that was told them about this child.

18. And all who heard it wondered about the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary kept all these proclamations, pondering in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they heard and saw, as it was told to them.

21. And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise him, that his name was called JESUS, the one called by the agent before he was conceived in the belly.

22. And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,

23. (just as it is written in a law of the Lord that every male that opens a womb will be called holy to the Lord),

24. and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in a law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

25. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the encouragement of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

26. And it was divinely revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he would not see death before he would see the Christ of the Lord.

27. And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, for them to do according to the custom of the law about him,

28. he also received it into his arms, and praised God, and said,

29. Now dismiss thy bondman in peace, Master, according to thy word,

30. because my eyes have seen thy salvation,

31. which thou prepared toward the face of all the peoples:

32. a light for enlightenment of Gentiles, and glory of thy people Israel.

33. And Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things being spoken about him.

34. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this man is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign being repudiated

35. (and also of thee, a sword will pierce through thine own soul), so that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.

36. And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (being advanced in many days, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,

37. and this woman was a widow to eighty-four years), who did not depart from the temple, serving with fastings and supplications night and day.

38. And having stood near at that same hour, she acknowledged the Lord, and spoke about him to all those who were awaiting redemption in Jerusalem.

39. And when they completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was upon it.

41. And his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover.

42. And when he became twelve years old, them having gone up according to the custom of the feast,

43. and having fulfilled the days, during their return the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and his mother did not know it,

44. but, having supposed him to be in the caravan, they went a day's journey. And they sought him among their kinfolk and acquaintances.

45. And not having found him, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking him.

46. And it came to pass after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and questioning them.

47. And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.

48. And when they saw him they were amazed. And his mother said to him, Child, why did thou this way to us? Behold, thy father and I were seeking thee sorrowing.

49. And he said to them, Why is it that ye were seeking me? Had ye not known that I must be among the things of my Father?

50. And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.

51. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was being subordinate to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and men.

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip being tetrarch of the region belonging to Ituraea, and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias being tetrarch of Abilene,

2. in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to be in John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3. And he came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching an immersion of repentance for remission of sins,

4. as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, which says, The voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.

5. Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be brought low. And the crooked things will be into straight and the rough into smooth ways.

6. And all flesh will see the salvation of God.

7. He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be immersed by him, Ye offspring of vipers, who showed you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

9. And even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore not making good fruit is cut down, and cast into fire.

10. And the crowds questioned him, saying, What then shall we do?

11. And having answered, he says to them, He who has two coats, let him share with him not having, and he who has food, let him do likewise.

12. And tax collectors also came to be immersed, and they said to him, Teacher, what should we do?

13. And he said to them, Collect not one thing more than from what has been appointed for you.

14. And men who were soldiers also questioned him, saying, And we, what should we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.

15. And as the people were expectant, and all pondering in their hearts about John, if perhaps he was the Christ,

16. John responded, saying to them all, I indeed immerse you in water, but a man mightier than I comes, of whom I am not worthy to unloose the strap of his shoes. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire,

17. whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

18. Indeed therefore, also exhorting the people with many other things, he preached the good news.

19. But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him about Herodias his brother's wife, and about all of which evil things Herod had done,

20. also added this to them all, he even locked up John in prison.

21. Now it came to pass, during the immersion of all the people, Jesus also having been immersed and praying, for the heaven to be opened,

22. and the Holy Spirit to descend in a bodily form as a dove upon him, and a voice to occur out of heaven, saying, Thou are my beloved Son. In thee I am well pleased.

23. And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,

24. the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph,

25. the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,

26. the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Joda,

27. the son of Joannan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,

28. the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,

29. the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,

30. the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,

31. the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,

32. the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,

33. the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,

34. the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,

35. the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Shelah

36. the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,

37. the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,

38. the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

## Luke 4

1. And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

2. being tempted forty days by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days, and when they were ended, afterward he was hungry.

3. And the devil said to him, If thou are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread.

4. And Jesus answered, saying to him, It is written, Man will not live on bread alone, but on every saying of God.

5. And having brought him onto a high mountain, the devil showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And the devil said to him, I will give to thee all this authority, and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I want I give it.

7. If therefore thou will worship before me, it will all be thine.

8. And having answered, Jesus said to him, Go thee behind me, Satan. It is written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve.

9. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and he said to him, If thou are the Son of God, cast thyself down from here,

10. for it is written, He will give his agents orders about thee, to protect thee,

11. and, They will take thee up on their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

12. And having answered, Jesus said to him, It is said, Thou shall not challenge the Lord thy God.

13. And when the devil ended every temptation, he withdrew from him until a time.

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And a report went out about him through the entire region around.

15. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

16. And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up. And according to that which was customary to him, he entered into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.

17. And the book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. And having opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to sent forth in deliverance those who have been broken,

19. to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.

20. And having closed the book, having given it back to the attendant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were focused on him.

21. And he began to say to them, Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your ears.

22. And all witnessed to him, and wondered at the words of grace that proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is this not the son of Joseph?

23. And he said to them, Ye will doubtless say to me this proverb: Physician, heal thyself. How many things we heard that happened at Capernaum, do also here in thy fatherland.

24. And he said, Truly I say to you, that not one prophet is acceptable in his fatherland.

25. But in truth I say to you, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine occurred on all the land.

26. And Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, to a widow woman of Sidon.

27. And many lepers were in Israel near Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.

28. And all in the synagogue were filled with rage, having heard these things.

29. And having risen up, they thrust him outside of the city, and brought him as far as the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw him down headlong.

30. But he, having passed through the midst of them, departed.

31. And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day,

32. and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.

33. And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean deity. And it cried out in a great voice, saying,

34. Oh no! What is with us and with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Did thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou are, the Holy man of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked it, saying, Be thou muzzled, and come out of him. And the demon having thrown him down in the midst, it came out of him, not having harm him.

36. And amazement developed in all, and they spoke among each other, saying, What is this word? Because with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.

37. And a report about him went forth into every place of the region around.

38. And having arisen from the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's mother-in-law was gripped by a great fever, and they besought him about her.

39. And having stood over her, he rebuked the fever. And it left her, and immediately after rising up, she served them.

40. And when the sun was setting, all, as many as had those who were incapacitated with various diseases, brought them to him. And having laid his hands on each one of them, he healed them.

41. And also demons came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou are the Christ, the Son of God. And rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.

42. And when it became day, having departed, he went to a desolate place. And the multitudes sought him, and they came to him, and were restraining him not depart from them.

43. But he said to them, I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because I was sent for this.

44. And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him to hear the word of God, and having stood still, he was beside the lake of Gennesaret.

2. And he saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen having gone out of them, were washing their nets.

3. And having entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And having sat down, he taught the crowds from the boat.

4. And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the depth, and let down your nets for a catch.

5. And having answered, Simon said to him, Master, having toiled through the whole night, we took nothing, but at thy saying, I will let down the net.

6. And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was tearing.

7. And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat, after coming, to assist them. And they came and filled both the boats, so as for them to be sunk down.

8. But Simon Peter having seen, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, because I am a sinful man, Lord.

9. For astonishment surrounded him, and all those with him, at the catch of the fishes that they caught,

10. and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, from henceforth thou will be catching men.

11. And when they brought their boats to land, after forsaking all, they followed him.

12. And it came to pass while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy. And having seen Jesus, having fallen on his face, he besought him, saying, Lord, if thou will, thou can make me clean.

13. And having stretched forth his hand, he touched him, having said, I will, be thou clean. And straightaway the leprosy departed from him.

14. And he commanded him to tell no man, but, After going, show thyself to the priest, and bring concerning thy cleansing, just as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.

15. But the report about him went through more, and many multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him from their infirmities.

16. But he himself was withdrawing into the desolate regions, and praying.

17. And it came to pass during one of those days, he was also teaching. And there were seated Pharisees and law teachers, who were men having come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was to heal them.

18. And behold, men bringing a man on a bed who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.

19. And not having found how they might bring him in because of the multitude, after going up upon the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with the small bed into the midst in front of Jesus.

20. And having seen their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

21. And the scholars and the Pharisees began to deliberate, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?

22. But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, having responded, he said to them, Why do ye deliberate in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?

24. But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority upon earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed man), I say to thee, Arise, and after taking up thy small bed, go to thy house.

25. And immediately having risen up before them, after taking up that on which he lay, he departed to his house glorifying God.

26. And amazement gripped all, and they glorified God. And they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.

27. And after these things he went forth and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And he said to him, Follow me.

28. And after leaving behind all, having risen up, he followed him.

29. And Levi made a great feast for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were relaxing with them.

30. And their scholars and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?

31. And having answered, Jesus said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those faring badly.

32. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.

33. And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink.

34. And he said to them, Ye cannot make the sons of the wedding hall fast while the bridegroom is with them.

35. But the days will also come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.

36. And he also spoke a parable to them. No man puts a patch of a new garment on an old garment, otherwise both the new tears, and that from the new will not blend with the old.

37. And no man puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins, and will itself be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.

38. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved together.

39. And no man having drunk old straightaway desires new, for he says, The old is better.

## Luke 6

1. Now it came to pass for him to be going through the grain fields on a particular sabbath, and his disciples were plucking the ears and were eating, rubbing them in their hands.

2. But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is not permitted to do on the sabbath day?

3. And having answered them, Jesus said, Have ye not read even this, what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him,

4. how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the loaves of the presentation, and also gave to those who were with him, which is not permitted to eat, except the priests alone?

5. And he said to them, The Son of man is lord also of the sabbath.

6. And it also came to pass on another sabbath for him to enter into the synagogue and teach. And a man was there, and his right hand was withered.

7. And the scholars and the Pharisees watched if he would heal on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.

8. But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And having risen, he stood up.

9. Then Jesus said to them, I will question you. What? Is it permitted on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm, to save life, or to kill?

10. And having looked around on them all, he said to him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did, and his hand was restored whole as the other.

11. But they were filled with fury, and deliberated with each other what they might do to Jesus.

12. And he happened in these days to go out onto the mountain to pray, and he was continuing all night in prayer to God.

13. And when it became day, he called his disciples, and chose twelve from them, whom he also named apostles:

14. Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,

16. Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.

17. And having come down with them, he stood on a level place. And a company of his disciples, and a large number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the maritime Tyre and Sidon, were those who came to hear him, and to be healed from their diseases,

18. also those who were afflicted with unclean spirits. And they were healed.

19. And all the multitude sought to touch him, because power came forth from him, and healed them all.

20. And having lifted up his eyes on his disciples, he said, Blessed are the poor, because the kingdom of God is what belongs to you.

21. Blessed are those who hunger now, because ye will be filled. Blessed are those who weep now, because ye will laugh.

22. Blessed are ye, when men will hate you, and when they will exclude you, and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, because of the Son of man.

23. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did in the same way to the prophets.

24. However, woe to you the rich, because ye have received your consolation.

25. Woe to you who are filled now, because ye will hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, because ye will mourn and weep.

26. Woe when men will speak well of you, for their fathers did in the same way to the false prophets.

27. But I say to you, to those who hear, love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.

28. Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who mistreat you.

29. To him who strikes thee on the cheek offer the other also, and from him who takes away thy cloak, also do not withhold thy coat.

30. Give to every man who asks thee, and from him who takes away thy personal things do not demand them back.

31. And as ye desire that men would do to you, do ye also to them likewise.

32. And if ye love those who love you, what credit is for you? For even sinners love those who love them.

33. And if ye do good to those who do good to you, what credit is for you? For even sinners do the same.

34. And if ye lend to whom ye hope to receive, what credit is for you? For even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

35. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, despairing nothing, and your reward will be great. And ye will be sons of the Most High, because he is good toward the ungrateful and bad.

36. Become ye therefore merciful, even as your Father is merciful.

37. And do not criticize, and ye will, no, not be criticized. And do not condemn, and ye will, no, not be condemned. Forgive, and ye will be forgiven.

38. Give, and it will be given to you, good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom. For with the same measure with which ye measure, it will be measured again to you.

39. And he spoke a parable to them. Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a ditch?

40. A disciple is not above his teacher, but every disciple who is fully developed will be as his teacher.

41. And why do thou see the speck in thy brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam in thine own eye?

42. Or how can thou say to thy brother, Brother, allow me to take out the speck that is in thine eye, when thou thyself do not see the beam in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first take out the beam from thine own eye, and then thou will see clearly to take out the speck in thy brother's eye.

43. For a good tree is not producing corrupt fruit, nor a corrupt tree producing good fruit.

44. For each tree is known from its own fruit. For they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they harvest grapes from a bramble bush.

45. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good, and the bad man out of the bad treasure of his heart brings forth the bad, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.

46. And why do ye call me, Lord, Lord, and not do the things that I say?

47. Every man who comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.

48. He is like a man who builds a house, who dug and excavated, and laid a foundation upon the rock. And when a flood developed, the stream beat upon that house, and could not shake it, for it had been founded upon the rock.

49. But he who heard, and not having done, is like a man who built a house upon the soil without a foundation, on which the stream beat, and straightaway it fell. And the ruin of that house became great.

## Luke 7

1. And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

2. And a certain centurion's bondman faring badly was going to perish, who was esteemed by him.

3. And having heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him who asked him that, having come, he would save his bondman.

4. And when they came to Jesus they urged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom thou may offer this,

5. for he loves our nation, and he himself built the synagogue for us.

6. And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far distant from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, be not troubled, for I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof.

7. Therefore neither did I consider myself worthy to come to thee, but speak by word, and my boy will be healed.

8. For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to this man, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my bondman, Do this, and he does.

9. And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled him, and having turned around to the multitude who followed him, he said, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.

10. And those who were sent, having returned to the house, found the bondman who was feeble, being well.

11. And it came to pass on the next day that he went to a city called Nain, and a considerable number of his disciples went with him, also a large multitude.

12. Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, an only begotten son who died was being carried out for his mother. And she was a widow, and a considerable crowd of the city was with her.

13. And when the Lord saw her, he felt compassion toward her, and said to her, Weep not.

14. And having come, he touched the coffin, and the men carrying it stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, arise.

15. And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.

16. And fear seized all. And they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised among us, and, God came to help his people.

17. And this report about him went forth in the whole of Judea, and in all the region around.

18. And the disciples of John informed him about all these things.

19. And having summoned a certain two of his disciples, John sent them to Jesus, saying, Are thou he who comes, or do we look for another man?

20. And when they came to him, they said, John the immerser has sent us to thee, saying, Are thou he who comes, or do we look for another man?

21. And in the same hour he healed many from diseases and plagues and evil spirits. And he granted sight to many blind men.

22. And having answered, Jesus said to them, After going, report to John the things that ye saw and heard: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor are preached good news.

23. And blessed is he, whoever will not be offended by me.

24. And after John's messengers departed, he began to say to the multitudes about John, What did ye go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

25. But what did ye go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those in elegant clothing, and existing in luxury, are in kingly places.

26. But what did ye go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he about whom it is written, Behold, I send my agent before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.

28. For I say to you, among men born of women there is not one prophet greater than John the immerser, yet the smaller in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

29. And all the people having heard, and the tax collectors who were immersed the immersion of John, justified God.

30. But the Pharisees and the lawyers who were not immersed by him, rejected the purpose of God for themselves.

31. To what, then will I compare the men of this generation, and to what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling to each other, and saying, We piped to you, and ye did not dance. We mourned to you, and ye did not weep.

33. For John the immerser has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.

34. The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold the man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!

35. And wisdom is justified from all her children.

36. And a certain man of the Pharisees asked him that he would eat with him. And having entered into the Pharisee's house, he sat down.

37. And behold, a woman in the city who was sinful. And when she knew that he sat in the Pharisee's house, having brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,

38. and having stood behind near his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with the tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. And she kissed his feet much, and anointed them with the ointment.

39. But when the Pharisee who invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would know who and what kind the woman is who touches him, that she is sinful.

40. And having responded, Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, speak Teacher.

41. There were two debtors to a certain creditor, the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

42. And of them not having to repay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore, do thou say, will love him more?

43. And having answered, Simon said, I suppose that it was to whom he forgave more. And he said to him, Thou have judged correctly.

44. And having turned to the woman, he said to Simon, See thou this woman? I entered into thy house; thou gave no water for my feet. But this woman has wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.

45. Thou gave me no kiss, but this woman, since I came in, has not ceased kissing my feet much.

46. Thou did not anoint my head with olive oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.

47. For this reason I say to thee, her many sins are forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, loves little.

48. And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.

49. And those who sat together began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?

50. And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee. Go in peace.

## Luke 8

1. And it came to pass that he traveled through, by city and village in succession, announcing and preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, and the twelve men with him,

2. and certain women who were healed from evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,

3. and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many other women who served them from the things they possessed.

4. And when a large multitude gathered together, and those coming to him from each city, he spoke by a parable.

5. The man who sows went forth to sow his seed. And during his sowing, some fell by the way, and it was trampled, and the birds of the sky devoured it.

6. And another fell on the rock, and having grown, it withered away because of not having moisture.

7. And another fell amidst the thorns, and having grown together, the thorns choked it.

8. And another fell on the good ground, and having grown it produced fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

9. And his disciples questioned him, saying, What is this parable?

10. And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others in parables, so that seeing they would not see, and hearing they would not understand.

11. Now the parable is this. The seed is the word of God.

12. And those by the way are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, lest having believed, they would be saved.

13. And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. And these have no root, who believe for a time, and withdraw in time of trial.

14. And that which fell in the thorns, these are those who heard, and as they go they are choked by cares and wealth and pleasures of life, and do not bring to maturity.

15. But those in the good ground, these are those who in an good and right heart, having heard the word, hold it firm, and bring forth fruit in perseverance.

16. And no man, having lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or places it under a bed, but places it on a lampstand, so that those who enter in may see the light.

17. For there is no secret that will not become visible, nor hid, that will not be known and come to be visible.

18. Notice therefore how ye hear. For whoever has, to him will be given, and whoever has not, even what he seems to have will be taken from him.

19. And his mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him because of the crowd.

20. And it was reported to him, saying, Thy mother and thy brothers stand outside, desiring to see thee.

21. But having answered, he said to them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.

22. Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, also his disciples. And he said to them, Let us pass through to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth,

23. but as they sailed he began to asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were filling up, and were in peril.

24. And having approached, they awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing. And having risen, he rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it became calm.

25. And he said to them, Where is your faith? And having feared, they wondered, saying to each other, Who then is this man, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?

26. And they sailed toward the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.

27. And when he came forth upon the land, a certain man met him out of the city, who had demons of a considerable time. And he wore no clothing, and did not dwell in a house, but in the sepulchers.

28. And when he saw Jesus, having cried out, he fell down before him. And in a great voice he said, What is with me and with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.

29. For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man, for many times it had seized him. And he was bound with chains and shackles, and guarded. And breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desolate regions.

30. And Jesus demanded him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion, because many demons were entered into him.

31. And they entreated him that he would not command them to go out into the abyss.

32. Now a herd of considerable swine was there feeding on the mountain, and they implored him that he would allow them to enter into those. And he allowed them.

33. And the demons having come out from the man, they entered into the swine. And the herd stampeded down the slope into the lake, and were drowned.

34. And when those who tended them saw what happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the fields.

35. And they came out to see what happened. And they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons had gone out, sitting near the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.

36. And also those who saw it informed them how the man who was demon-possessed was saved.

37. And the whole multitude of the region around the Gadarenes besought him to depart from them, because they were gripped by great fear. And he, having embarked into the boat, returned.

38. But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,

39. Return to thy house, and relate everything God did for thee. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city how many things Jesus did for him.

40. And it came to pass during Jesus returning, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.

41. And behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And having fallen down near Jesus' feet, he besought him to come into his house,

42. because there was with him an only begotten daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But during his going the multitudes thronged him.

43. And a woman being with an issue of blood for twelve years, who, although she spent her entire living on physicians, was unable to be healed by any,

44. having come from behind, she touched the border of his garment. And immediately the issue of her blood stayed.

45. And Jesus said, Who is he who touched me? But when they all denied, Peter and those with him, said, Master, the multitudes come together and crowd thee, and thou say, Who is he who touched me?

46. But Jesus said, Who touched me? For I perceived power having gone forth from me.

47. And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling. And having fallen down before him, she declared to him in the presence of all the people for what reason she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.

48. And he said to her, Cheer up, Daughter. Thy faith has healed thee. Go in peace.

49. While he still spoke, some man comes from the synagogue ruler, saying to him, Thy daughter has died. Do not trouble the teacher.

50. But having heard it, Jesus answered him, saying, Fear not, only believe and she will be saved.

51. And when he came to the house, he did not allow any man to enter in except Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl and the mother.

52. And all were weeping and bewailing her. But he said, Weep not. She did not die, but sleeps.

53. And they ridiculed him, knowing that she died.

54. But having sent them all away outside, having taken her by the hand, he called out, saying, Girl, awake.

55. And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. And he commanded to give her to eat.

56. And her parents were amazed, but he ordered them to tell no man that which happened.

## Luke 9

1. And having summoned the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.

2. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal those who were incapacitated.

3. And he said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither staffs, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor have two coats each.

4. And into whatever house ye may enter, remain there, and from there depart.

5. And as many as will not receive you, when departing from that city, also shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

6. And having departed, they passed through the villages, preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.

7. But Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead,

8. and by some that Elijah appeared, and by others that a prophet, one of the ancient men arose.

9. And Herod said, I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.

10. And when the apostles returned, they related to him as many things as they did. And having taken them along, he withdrew in private into a desolate place of a city called Bethsaida.

11. But the multitudes having known, they followed him. And having received them, he spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.

12. And the day began to decline, and the twelve having come near, they said to him, Send the multitude away, so that, after going into the villages and fields around, they may rest and find provision, because we are here in a desolate place.

13. But he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, There are for us not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless, after going, we might buy food for all this people.

14. For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of fifty each.

15. And they did so, and made them all sit down.

16. And after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke in pieces, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.

17. And they ate, and were all filled. And there were taken up to them of the remaining fragments, twelve baskets.

18. And it came to pass, as he was praying privately, the disciples were with him. And he questioned them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?

19. And having answered, they said, John the immerser, but others, Elijah, and others, that a certain prophet of the ancient men arose.

20. And he said to them, But ye, who say ye that I am? And having answered, Peter said, The Christ of God.

21. But having chided them, he commanded to tell this to no man,

22. saying, It is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scholars, and be killed, and the third day to rise.

23. And he said to all, If any man wants to come behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

24. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever may lose his life because of me, this man will save it.

25. For what is a man benefited, having gained the whole world, but having lost or having forfeited himself?

26. For whoever may be ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of this man when he comes in his glory, and of the Father, and of the holy agents.

27. But I tell you truly, there are some of those who stand here, who will, no, not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

28. And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that after taking Peter and John and James, he went up onto the mountain to pray.

29. And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing glistening white.

30. And behold, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,

31. who, having appeared in glory, spoke of his departure, which he was going to fulfill at Jerusalem.

32. But Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, and having become awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.

33. And it came to pass, as they were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, and we could make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he was saying.

34. And while he was speaking these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.

35. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son. Hear ye him.

36. And at the occurrence of the voice, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and informed no man in those days any of the things that they have seen.

37. And it came to pass, on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.

38. And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son, because he is the only begotten to me.

39. And lo, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him with foaming. And it departs from him difficultly, injuring him.

40. And I begged thy disciples that they might cast it out, and they could not.

41. And having answered, Jesus said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long will I be with you and endure you? Bring thy son here.

42. And as he was still coming, the demon tore him, and he convulsed. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

43. And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while all were wondering at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,

44. Place ye these sayings into your ears, for the Son of man is going to be delivered up into the hands of men.

45. But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they did not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.

46. But a thought entered among them, which of them may be greater.

47. But having perceived the thought of their heart, having taken a child, Jesus stood it beside him,

48. and he said to them, Whoever may receive this child in my name receives me, and whoever may receive me receives him who sent me, for he who exists smaller among you all, this man will be great.

49. And having answered, John said, Master, we saw a certain man casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.

50. But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid, for he who is not against us is for us.

51. And it came to pass, while fulfilling the days for his ascension, that he also set his face to go to Jerusalem.

52. And he sent agents before his face, and they went. And having gone, they entered into a village of Samaritans, so as to make ready for him.

53. And they did not receive him, because his face was going to Jerusalem.

54. And his disciples James and John having seen, they said, Lord, do thou want that we should call fire to come down from the sky, and consume them, as also Elijah did?

55. But having turned around, he rebuked them, and said, Ye do not know what kind of spirit ye are.

56. For the Son of man came not to destroy the lives of men, but to save. And they went to another village.

57. And it came to pass while they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow thee wherever thou may go, Lord.

58. And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky, nests, but the Son of man has not where he might lay his head.

59. And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first, after departing, to bury my father.

60. But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but thou, after departing, proclaim the kingdom of God.

61. And also another said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those in my house.

62. But Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to a plow, and looking to things behind, is fit for the kingdom of God.

## Luke 10

1. Now after these things the Lord also appointed seventy other men, and sent them by twos before his face into every city and place where he himself was going to come.

2. Therefore he said to them, The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the workmen are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth workmen into his harvest.

3. Go ye. Behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Carry no bag, no pouch, no shoes, and greet no man on the way.

5. And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house.

6. And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him, and if not, it will return to you.

7. And remain in the same house eating and drinking from their things, for the workman is worthy of his wage. Do not depart from house to house.

8. And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.

9. And heal the weak in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you.

10. But into whatever city ye enter, and they will not receive you, after departing into the thoroughfares of it, say,

11. Even the dust that clings on us from your city, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know ye this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.

12. I say to you, that it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

13. Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! Because if the mighty works were done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, which was exalted to the sky, will be thrust down to Hades.

16. He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.

17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are made subject to us in thy name.

18. And he said to them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from the sky.

19. Behold, I give you authority to tread over serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and, no, nothing will harm you.

20. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are made subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in the heavens.

21. In the same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit, and said, I thank thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, that thou hid these things from the wise and astute, and revealed them to the childlike. Yea, Father, because it became pleasing this way in thy sight.

22. And having turned to the disciples, he said, All things were delivered to me by my Father. And no man knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son wants to reveal him.

23. And having turning toward the disciples in private, he said, Blessed are the eyes that see what ye see.

24. For I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see what ye see, and did not see, and to hear what ye hear, and did not hear.

25. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up testing him, and saying, Teacher, having done what, would I inherit eternal life?

26. And he said to him, What is written in the law? How read thou?

27. And having answered, he said, Thou shall love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole strength, and from thy whole mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.

28. And he said to him, Thou answered correctly. Do this and thou will live.

29. But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30. And having replied, Jesus said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. And he encountered bandits, who also, having stripped him and having beat him, departed having left him being half dead.

31. And by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

32. And likewise also a Levite who happened upon the place, having come, and having looked, passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to him, and when he saw him, felt compassion.

34. And having come, he wrapped up his wounds, pouring on olive oil and wine. And having set him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. And on the morrow when departing, after taking out two denarii, he gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him, and whatever thou might spend more, I will repay thee at my return.

36. Which therefore, of these three, appears to thee to have become neighbor to the man who fell among the bandits?

37. And he said, He who did mercy with him. Therefore Jesus said to him, Go, and do thou likewise.

38. And it came to pass as they went, he also entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

39. And she was sister to this woman called Mary, who also, having sat at Jesus' feet, was listening to his word.

40. But Martha was encumbered about much serving. And having stood near, she said, Lord, do thou not care that my sister left me behind to serve alone? Speak to her therefore that she may help me.

41. But having answered, Jesus said to her, Martha, Martha, thou are anxious and troubled about many things,

42. but one thing is necessary, and Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.

## Luke 11

1. And it came to pass as he was in a certain place praying, that when he ceased, a certain man of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.

2. And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father in the heavens, hallowed be thy name. May thy kingdom come, may thy will happen on the earth as also in heaven.

3. Give us our bread sufficient for each day.

4. And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive every man who is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

5. And he said to them, Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,

6. since a friend arrived from the road to me, and I do not have what I would set before him,

7. and that man from inside, having answered, would say, Do not cause toils for me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I am not able, after getting up, to give thee?

8. I say to you, though he will not give him, after getting up, because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, having awaken, he will give him as many as he needs.

9. And I say to you, ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and ye will find. Knock, and it will be opened.

10. For every man who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.

11. And which father of you, if the son will ask a loaf, will give him a stone, or also if a fish, in place of a fish will give him a serpent?

12. Or if he should ask for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

13. If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more the Father from heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?

14. And he was casting out a demon, and it was mute. And it happened when the demon was gone out, the mute man spoke. And the multitudes marveled,

15. but some of them said, He casts out the demons by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons.

16. And others, challenging, sought from him a sign from the sky.

17. But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom that was divided against itself is made desolate, and a house against a house falls.

18. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom be made to stand? Because ye say that I cast out the demons by Beelzebub.

19. And if I cast out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they will be your judges.

20. But if by a finger of God I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

21. When the fully armed strong man guards his palace, the things possessed by him are in peace,

22. but when a stronger than he comes, after defeating him, he takes away his full armor in which he trusted, and divides his booty.

23. He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.

24. When the unclean spirit departs out of the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest. And not finding, it says, I will return to my house from where I came out.

25. And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.

26. Then it goes, and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having enter in, it dwells there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.

27. And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman, having lifted up her voice out of the crowd, said to him, Blessed is the belly that bore thee, and the breasts that thou suckled.

28. But he said, Blessed rather, are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.

29. And when the multitudes gathered together he began to say, This generation is evil. They seek a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah, the prophet.

30. For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of man will be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south will awake in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

33. And no man, having lit a lamp, puts it in a concealed place, nor under the bushel, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter in may see the light.

34. The lamp of thy body is the eye. Therefore, when thine eye is sound, thy whole body is also bright, but when it is bad, thy body is also dark.

35. Watch therefore the light in thee not be darkness.

36. If therefore thy whole body is bright, not having any part dark, the whole will be bright, as when the lamp illuminates thee by the radiance.

37. Now as he spoke a certain Pharisee asks him that he might dine with him. And having entered in, he sat down.

38. And when the Pharisee saw, he marveled that he did not first wash before dinner.

39. And the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your interior is full of plundering and wickedness.

40. Ye foolish men, did not he who made the outside also make the inside?

41. But give compassion, things that are inside, and behold, all things are clean to you.

42. But woe to you Pharisees! Because ye tithe mint and rue and every plant, and pass by justice and the love of God. It is necessary to do these things, and not to neglect those things.

43. Woe to you Pharisees! Because ye love the place of honor in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.

44. Woe to you scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye are like the unseen sepulchers, and the men who walk over them do not know.

45. And having answered, a certain man of the lawyers says to him, Teacher, in saying these things thou rebuke us also.

46. And he said, Woe also to you lawyers! Because ye load men with burdens difficult to bear, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. Woe to you! Because ye build the sepulchers of the prophets, but your fathers killed them.

48. Consequently, ye testify and approve the works of your fathers, because they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchers.

49. Because of this also the wisdom of God said, I will send to them prophets and apostles. And some of them they will kill and persecute,

50. so that the blood of all the prophets that was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,

51. from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I say to you, it will be required of this generation.

52. Woe to you lawyers! Because ye took away the key of knowledge. Ye did not enter in yourselves, and ye hindered those who were entering in.

53. And after he said these things to them, the scholars and the Pharisees began to harass him extremely, and to provoke him to speak impulsively about more things,

54. waiting to ambush him, seeking to catch something out of his mouth so that they might accuse him.

## Luke 12

1. During which time the myriads of the multitude having gathered together so as to trample each other, he began first to say to his disciples, Take heed to yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.

3. Therefore, as many things as ye have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed upon the housetops.

4. And I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of those who kill the body, and after these things not having anything more severe to do.

5. But I will show you whom ye should fear. Fear him, who, after killing, has power to cast into hell. Yes, I say to you, fear ye him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.

7. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore, ye are superior to many sparrows.

8. And I say to you, every man who will confess in me before men, the Son of man will also confess in him before the agents of God,

9. but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the agents of God.

10. And every man who will speak a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but to him who blasphemed against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven.

11. And when they bring you to the synagogues, and the principle positions, and the offices of authority, be not anxious how or what ye should answer in defense, or what ye should say,

12. for the Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.

13. And a certain man out of the crowd said to him, Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.

14. But he said to him, Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbitrator over you?

15. And he said to them, Watch, and keep away from greed, because to any man, life to him is not in the abundance of things possessed by him.

16. And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth well.

17. And he pondered within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have nowhere I will store my crops?

18. And he said, I will do this. I will dismantle my barns, and I will build greater, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou have many goods laid up for many years. Take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.

20. But God said to him, Thou foolish man, they demand thy soul from thee this night, and the things that thou prepared, whose will they be?

21. So is he who stores up for himself, and is not being rich toward God.

22. And he said to his disciples, Because of this I say to you, be not anxious for your life, what ye may eat, nor for the body, what ye may wear.

23. For the life is more than the food, and the body, the clothing.

24. Consider the ravens, because they do not sow, nor do they reap, for which there is no storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them. How much ye are worth more than the birds.

25. And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his age?

26. If then ye are not able to do even the least, why are ye anxious about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow. They toil not, nor do they spin, and I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.

28. And if God so clothes the grass in the field, which today is, and tomorrow being cast into the oven, how much more you, O ye of little faith?

29. And do not seek what ye may eat, and what ye may drink, and do not be unsettled.

30. For the nations of the world seek all these things, and your Father knows that ye have need of these things.

31. However, seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you.

32. Fear not, little flock, because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell things possessed by you, and give charity. Make for yourselves purses not becoming old, a treasure unfailing in the heavens, where no thief approaches, nor moth corrupts.

34. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

35. Let your loins be girded about, and the lights burning,

36. and be ye like men waiting for their lord, when he may return from the wedding festivities, so that when he comes and knocks, they may straightaway open to him.

37. Blessed are those bondmen whom the lord when he comes will find watching. Truly I say to you, that he will gird himself, and will cause them to sit down, and having come, will serve them.

38. And if he should come in the second watch, and should come in the third watch, and find so, blessed are those bondmen.

39. But know this, that if the house-ruler had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

40. Therefore, ye also become ready, because the Son of man comes at that hour ye do not suppose.

41. And Peter said to him, Lord, did thou speak this parable to us, or also to all?

42. And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his lord will appoint over his service to give the provision on time?

43. Blessed is that bondman whom his lord when he comes will find so doing.

44. Truly I say to you, that he will appoint him over the things being possessed by him.

45. But if that bondman should say in his heart, My lord is late to come, and should begin to beat the servant boys and the servant girls, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,

46. the lord of that bondman will arrive in a day that he does not expect, and in an hour that he is not aware, and will cut him in two, and will place his portion with the unbelieving.

47. And that bondman who knew his lord's will, and who did not prepare, nor do according to his will, will be beaten much,

48. but he who did not know, and did things worthy of blows, will be beaten little. And to every man to whom much was given, much will be required from him. And to whom they entrust much, they will ask him more abundantly.

49. I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what I desire is if it were kindled already.

50. But I have an immersion to be immersed, and how am I constrained until it will be accomplished.

51. Do ye suppose that I came to give peace on the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.

52. For henceforth there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. A father will be divided against a son, and a son against a father, a mother against a daughter, and a daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

54. And he also said to the multitudes, When ye see a cloud rising from the west, straightaway ye say, A shower is coming, and so it happens.

55. And when a south wind is blowing, ye say, There will be heat, and it happens.

56. Ye hypocrites, ye know how to examine the face of the earth and the sky, but how can ye not examine this season?

57. And also why do ye not judge yourselves what is right?

58. For when thou go with thine opponent to the magistrate on the way give effort to be delivered from him, lest he may drag thee to the judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and the officer would cast thee into prison.

59. I say to thee, thou will, no, not come out from there, until thou have paid even the last mite.

## Luke 13

1. Now some were present at the same time who informed him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.

2. And having answered, Jesus said to them, Do ye suppose that these Galileans became sinful above all the Galileans because they have suffered such things?

3. I tell you, no, but if ye do not repent, ye will all perish similarly.

4. Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them. Do ye think that these became debtors above all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, no, but if ye do not repent, ye will all likewise perish.

6. And he spoke this parable. A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.

7. And he said to the vine workman, Behold, three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none. Cut it down, why also waste the ground?

8. And having answered, he says to him, Sir, allow it this year also until I may dig around it and cast manure.

9. Although surely it should bear fruit, and if not, in the coming year thou will cut it down.

10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.

11. And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years. And she was bent over, and not being able to straighten up completely.

12. And when Jesus saw her, he called out, and said to her, Woman, thou are loosed from thine infirmity.

13. And he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

14. And having responded, the synagogue-ruler, being indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which he ought to work. Therefore coming in these, be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.

15. But the Lord therefore answered him and said, Ye hypocrites, does not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall, and after leading away, give to drink?

16. And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound, lo, eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath?

17. And as he said these things all those opposing him were shamed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

18. And he said, What is the kingdom of God like, and to what will I compare it?

19. It is like a grain of a mustard plant, which having taken, a man cast into his own garden. And it grew and developed into a great tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches if it.

20. And again he said, To what will I compare the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven that a woman having taken, hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.

22. And he went through by cities and villages, teaching, and making a journey toward Jerusalem.

23. And a certain man said to him, Lord, are they few who are being saved? And he said to them,

24. Compete to enter in by the narrow gate, because many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.

25. From the time the house-ruler has risen up, and has closed the door, and ye begin to stand outside, and to knock the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, and having answered, he will say to you, I know not where ye are from,

26. then ye will begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou taught in our thoroughfares.

27. And he will say, I tell you, I know not where ye are from. Depart from me, all ye workmen of unrighteousness.

28. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you being thrust out.

29. And they will arrive from the east and west, and from the north and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God.

30. And behold, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.

31. In the same day some Pharisees came, saying to him, Get thee out and depart from here, because Herod wants to kill thee.

32. And he said to them, Having gone, say to this fox, Behold, I cast out demons and finish cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am fully perfected.

33. Nevertheless it is necessary for me to go today and tomorrow and the following, because it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather thy children together as a hen does her brood under her wings, and ye would not.

35. Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I say to you, that ye will, no, not see me, until it will come when ye say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

## Luke 14

1. And it came to pass, when he went into the house of a certain man of the chiefs of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.

2. And behold, there was a certain man in front of him afflicted with edema.

3. And having responded, Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it permitted to heal on the sabbath?

4. But they were silent. And having taken him, he healed him and released him.

5. And having responded, he said to them, Of which of you will a son or an ox fall into a pit, and he will not straightaway lift him out on the day of the sabbath?

6. And they could not answer him back to these things.

7. And he spoke a parable to those who were invited when he noticed how they chose out the chief places, saying to them,

8. When thou are invited by any man to wedding festivities, do not sit down in the chief place, lest there may be a more honorable man than thou who was invited by him.

9. And he who invited thee and him, having come, will say to thee, Give place to this man, and then thou will begin with embarrassment to take the last place.

10. But when thou are invited, having gone, sit down in the last place, so that when he who has invited thee comes, he will say to thee, Friend, go up higher, then it will be esteem to thee in the presence of those dining with thee.

11. Because every man who lifts himself up will be made lower, and he who makes himself lower will be lifted up.

12. And he also said to the man who invited him, When thou make a dinner or a supper, do not call thy friends, nor thy brothers, nor thy kinsmen, nor prosperous neighbors, lest they also invite thee in return, and a recompense be made to thee.

13. But when thou make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,

14. and thou will be blessed, because they do not have to recompense thee, for it will be recompensed to thee at the resurrection of the righteous.

15. And a certain man of those dining together having heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will eat dinner in the kingdom of God.

16. And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many.

17. And he sent forth his bondman at the hour of the meal to say to those who were invited, Come, because all things are now ready.

18. And they all from one began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I have need to go out and see it. I ask thee have me excused.

19. And another said, I bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to test them. I ask thee have me excused.

20. And another said, I married a wife, and because of this I cannot come.

21. And that bondman, having come, he informed his lord these things. Then the house-ruler having become angry, he said to his bondman, Go out quickly into the thoroughfares and lanes of the city, and bring here the poor and maimed and crippled and blind.

22. And the bondman said, Lord, as thou commanded it has happened, and yet there is room.

23. And the lord said to the bondman, Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

24. For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper. For many are called, but few chosen.

25. Now many multitudes went with him, and having turned, he said to them,

26. If any man comes to me, and does not regard as inferior his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and besides his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

27. And whoever does not bear his cross, and come behind me, cannot be my disciple.

28. For which of you wanting to build a tower, does not, having first sat down, count the cost whether he has the things for completion?

29. So that perhaps, having laid its foundation, and not being able to finish, all those who see begin to ridicule him,

30. saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

31. Or what king going to encounter another king in war, will not, having first sat down, consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?

32. And if not, while he is still far off, having sent a delegation, he asks the things about peace.

33. So therefore every man of you who does not renounce all things being possessed by him, cannot be my disciple.

34. The salt material is good, but if the salt material becomes tasteless, by what will it be seasoned?

35. It is fit neither for the land nor for manure; they cast it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

## Luke 15

1. Now all the tax collectors and sinners were approaching him to hear him.

2. And the Pharisees and the scholars murmured, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them.

3. And he spoke this parable to them, saying,

4. What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave behind the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go for that which was lost until he finds it?

5. And when he finds it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And when he comes to the house, he calls together his men friends and his men neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.

7. I say to you, that thus there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous men who have no need of repentance.

8. Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she finds it?

9. And when she has found it, she calls together her lady friends and lady neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, because I found the drachma that I lost.

10. Thus I say to you, there becomes joy in the presence of the agents of God over one sinner who repents.

11. And he said, A certain man had two sons,

12. and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me. And he divided to them his living.

13. And not many days after, the younger son, having gathered all together, journeyed into a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth living recklessly.

14. And when he spent all, a mighty famine developed in that country, and he began to be in want.

15. And having gone, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

16. And he longed to fill his belly from the husks that the swine ate, and no man gave to him.

17. But when he came to himself, he said, How many hired men of my father's have abundance of loaves, but I am perishing with hunger.

18. After rising, I will go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight.

19. I am no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired men.

20. And having risen, he went to his father. But while he was still distant, afar off, his father saw him and felt compassion. And having ran, he fell on his neck, and kissed him much.

21. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight. I am no more worthy to be called thy son.

22. But the father said to his bondmen, Bring forth the best robe and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and shoes for his feet.

23. And having brought the fatted calf, kill it, and having eaten, we will be cheerful,

24. because this my son was dead, and became alive again. And he was lost, and is found. And they began to be cheerful.

25. But his elder son was in a field. And while coming, having approached the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. And having summoned one of the boys, he inquired what these things might be.

27. And he said to him, Thy brother arrived, and thy father has killed the fatted calf, because he received him back healthy.

28. But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore, his father having come out, he called him.

29. But having answered, he said to his father, Lo, so many years do I serve thee, and I never passed by a commandment of thine, and yet thou never gave me a goat that I might be merry with my friends.

30. But when this thy son came, who has devoured thy living with harlots, thou killed for him the fatted calf.

31. And he said to him, Child, thou are always with me, and all my things are yours.

32. But it was needful to make merry and be glad, because this thy brother was dead, and became alive again, and was lost, and was found.

## Luke 16

1. And he also said to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a manager, and this man was accused to him as squandering things possessed by him.

2. And having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear about thee? Render the account of thy management, for thou can no longer manage.

3. And the manager said within himself, What shall I do because my lord takes away the management from me? I am not able to dig. I am ashamed to beg.

4. I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the management they may receive me into their houses.

5. And having summoned each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much do thou owe to my lord?

6. And he said, A hundred measures of olive oil. And he said to him, Receive thy document, and having sat down, quickly write fifty.

7. Next he said to another, And how much do thou owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he says to him, Receive thy document, and write eighty.

8. And his lord commended the unrighteous manager because he did shrewdly. Because the sons of this age are shrewder in their own generation than the sons of the light.

9. And I say to you, make friends for yourselves from the mammon of unrighteousness, so that, when ye cease, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.

10. The man faithful in the least is faithful also in much, and the man unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.

11. If therefore ye did not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is true?

12. And if ye did not become faithful in the alien, who will give thine to you?

13. No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

14. And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things, and they sneered him.

15. And he said to them, Ye are those who declare yourselves righteous in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. Because what is lofty among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

16. The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed good news, and every man in it is treated aggressively.

17. But it is easier for the heaven and the earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.

18. Every man who divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery, and every man who marries her who has been divorced from a husband commits adultery.

19. Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously daily.

20. But there was a certain poor man named Lazarus, who had been placed near his gate, covered with sores,

21. and longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. But even the dogs that came licked his sores.

22. And it came to pass for the poor man to die and be carried by the agents to Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died and was buried.

23. And having lifted up his eyes in Hades, being in torments, he sees Abraham from afar and Lazarus by his bosom.

24. And having cried out, he said, Father Abraham, be merciful to me, and send Lazarus, so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Child, remember that thou in thy lifetime received thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now here he is comforted and thou are in agony.

26. And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those here who want to cross over to you are not able, nor may those go across from there to us.

27. And he said, I beg thee therefore, father, that thou would send him to my father's house,

28. for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

29. But Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.

30. And he said, No, father Abraham, but if some man would go to them from the dead they will repent.

31. And he said to him, If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if some man would rise from the dead.

## Luke 17

1. And he said to his disciples, It is impossible for the stumbling-blocks not to come, but woe to him through whom they come!

2. It is better for him if a donkey-powered millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.

3. Take heed to yourselves. And if thy brother should sin against thee, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.

4. And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times in the day turn back, saying, I repent, thou will forgive him.

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase faith for us.

6. And the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard plant, ye would say to this sycamine tree, Be thou uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.

7. But which of you having a bondman plowing or feeding livestock, who, when he comes in from the field, will straightaway say, After coming near, sit down?

8. Will he not rather say to him, Prepare what I may dine, and having gird thyself, serve me until I eat and drink, and after these things thou will eat and drink?

9. Does he have a favor for that bondman because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.

10. Thus ye also, when ye did all the things that were commanded you, say, We are unprofitable bondmen, because we have done what we are obligated to do.

11. And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem, that he was passing through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And as he entered into a certain village, ten leprous men who stood from afar met him.

13. And they raised a voice, saying, Jesus, Master, be merciful to us.

14. And when he saw them, he said to them, After departing, display yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, during their going they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back with a great voice glorifying God.

16. And he fell upon his face beside his feet giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.

17. And having answered, Jesus said, Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?

18. Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?

19. And he said to him, After rising, go. Thy faith has healed thee.

20. And questioned by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation,

21. nor will they say, Lo, here! or, Lo, there! For behold, the kingdom of God is inside of you.

22. And he said to the disciples, The days will come when ye will long to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye will not see it.

23. And they will say to you, Lo, here! Lo, there! Do not depart, nor pursue.

24. For just as the lightning, its flashing from under the sky to under the sky, illuminates, so will the Son of man be in his day.

25. But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things and be rejected from this generation.

26. And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so also it will be in the days of the Son of man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

28. And likewise as it happened in the days of Lot. They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built.

29. But in that day Lot went out from Sodom he rained fire and brimstone from the sky, and destroyed them all.

30. It will be according to these things in that day the Son of man is revealed.

31. In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his vessels in the house, let him not go down to take them up. And let him who is in the field likewise not return for the things behind.

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Whoever will seek to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose it will keep it alive.

34. I say to you, in that night there will be two in one bed. The one man will be taken, and the other man will be left.

35. Two will be grinding together. The one woman will be taken, and the other woman will be left.

36. This verse is not in the majority of the Greek manuscripts.

37. And having answered, they say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body is, there the vultures will be gathered together.

## Luke 18

1. And he also spoke a parable to them about it being necessary to always pray, and not to give up,

2. saying, In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God, and did not regard man.

3. And a widow was in that city, and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent.

4. And for a time he would not, but after these things he said within himself, Although I fear not God, and regard not man,

5. yet because this widow causes me a beating, I will avenge her, lest by no end of coming she give me a black eye.

6. And the Lord said, Hear ye what the unrighteous judge says.

7. And God, will he, no, not do the vengeance of his chosen who cry out to him day and night, and yet being patient toward them?

8. I say to you, that he will do their vengeance speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he then find faith on the earth?

9. And he also spoke this parable to some of those who were persuaded in themselves that they were righteous, and disdained other men.

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.

11. Having stood by himself, the Pharisee prayed these things: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, predatory, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.

12. I fast twice of the week. I tithe all things, as many as I acquire.

13. But the tax collector, having stood from afar, would not even lift his eyes to the sky, but beat upon his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinful man.

14. I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that man. Because every man who lifts himself up will be made lower, and he who makes himself lower will be lifted up.

15. And they were also bringing the infants to him, so that he would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

16. But having summoned them, Jesus said, Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, will, no, not enter into it.

18. And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, Good teacher, having done what, will I inherit eternal life?

19. And Jesus said to him, Why do thou call me good? None is good except one, God.

20. Thou know the commandments. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not give false testimony. Honor thy father and thy mother.

21. And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth.

22. And when he heard these things, Jesus said to him, Yet one thing is lacking from thee. Sell all things, as many as thou have, and distribute to the poor, and thou will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.

23. But when he heard these things, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.

24. And having seen him become very sorrowful, Jesus said, How difficultly those who have riches will enter into the kingdom of God.

25. For it is easier for a camel to enter in through the hole of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And those who heard it said, And who can be saved?

27. And he said, The things impossible with men are possible with God.

28. And Peter said, Lo, we have left all and followed thee.

29. And he said to them, Truly I say to you, that there is no man who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who will, no, not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age eternal life.

31. And having taken along the twelve, he said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets about the Son of man will be completed.

32. For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, and he will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.

33. And after scourging, they will kill him, and the third day he will rise up.

34. And they understood none of these things, and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things that were said.

35. And it came to pass as he approached Jericho, a certain blind man sat beside the road begging.

36. And having heard a multitude going by, he inquired what this may be.

37. And they informed him that Jesus the Nazarene passes by.

38. And he cried out, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, be merciful to me.

39. And those who went ahead rebuked him, so that he would be quiet, but he cried out much more, Thou son of David, be merciful to me.

40. And having stood still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he questioned him,

41. saying, What do thou that I would do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive sight.

42. And Jesus said to him, Receive sight. Thy faith has healed thee.

43. And immediately he received sight, and followed him glorifying God. And all the people when they saw it gave praise to God.

## Luke 19

1. And having entered, he was passing through Jericho.

2. And behold, a man called by name, Zacchaeus. And he was a chief tax collector, and this man was rich.

3. And he sought to see Jesus, who he was. And he was not able because of the crowd, because his stature was small.

4. And having ran ahead, he climbed up in a sycamore tree so that he might see him, because he was going to pass that one.

5. And when Jesus came to the place, having looked up, he saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, after making haste, come down, for today I must lodge at thy house.

6. And having made haste, he came down and received him, rejoicing.

7. And all who saw murmured, saying, He went in to relax with a sinful man.

8. And having stood, Zacchaeus said to the Lord, Behold, half of the things possessed by me, Lord, I give to the poor. And if I defrauded any man of anything, I repay fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.

11. And as they heard these things, he spoke, adding on a parable because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.

12. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

13. And having called ten of his bondmen, he gave them ten minas and said to them, Do business until I come.

14. But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy behind him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.

15. And it came to pass for him to return, having taken the kingdom. And he said for these bondmen to be called to him, to whom he gave the silver, so that he might know what any man gained by trading.

16. And the first came, saying, Lord, thy mina gained ten minas.

17. And he said to him, Well, thou good bondman. Because thou became faithful in the least, be thou having authority over ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, thy mina gained five minas.

19. And he also said to him, And thou become over five cities.

20. And another came, saying, Lord, behold thy mina, which I had put away in a napkin.

21. For I was afraid of thee because thou are an austere man. Thou take up what thou did not lay down, and reap what thou did not sow.

22. He says to him, Out of thy mouth I will judge thee, thou evil bondman. Thou had known that I am an austere man taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow.

23. Then why did thou not give my silver into a bank, and having come I would have collected it with interest?

24. And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.

25. And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.

26. For I say to you, that to every man who has, will be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.

27. Nevertheless those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring here, and kill them before me.

28. And having spoke these things, he went ahead, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And it came to pass when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying,

30. Go ye into the opposite village, in which, having entered, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Having untied, bring it.

31. And if any man asks you, Why do ye untie it? Thus ye will say to him, The Lord has need of it.

32. And having departed, those who were sent found just as he said to them.

33. And as they were untying the colt, the masters of it said to them, Why do ye untie the colt?

34. And they said, The Lord has need of it.

35. And they brought it to Jesus. And having cast their garments upon the colt, they mounted Jesus.

36. And as he went, they spread their garments on the road.

37. And as he was now coming near, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God in a great voice about all the mighty works that they had seen, saying,

38. Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!

39. And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.

40. And having answered, he said to them, I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.

41. And when he came near, having seen the city, he wept over it,

42. saying, If thou knew, even thou, indeed even in this thy day, the things for thy peace. But now they are hidden from thine eyes.

43. Because the days will come upon thee, and thine enemies will build a barricade around thee, and will surround thee, and enclose thee on every side.

44. And they will raze thee and thy children within thee. And they will not leave in thee a stone upon a stone, because thou knew not the time of thy visitation.

45. And having entered into the temple, he began to cast out those selling and buying in it,

46. saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but ye made it a den of robbers.

47. And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scholars sought to destroy him, even the foremost men of the people.

48. And they did not find what they might do, for the people all hung upon him, listening.

## Luke 20

1. And it came to pass on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the good news, the chief priests and the scholars with the elders stood near.

2. And they spoke, saying to him, Tell us, by what authority are thou doing these things? Or who is he who gave thee this authority?

3. And having answered, he said to them, I also will ask you one word, and ye tell me.

4. The immersion of John, was it from heaven or from men?

5. And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven, he will say, Why did ye not believe him?

6. But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are convinced John is a prophet.

7. And they replied not to know from where.

8. And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

9. And he began to speak this parable to the people. A man planted a vineyard, and leased it to farmers, and went abroad for a considerable time.

10. And at the season he sent a bondman to the farmers, so that they would give him from the fruit of the vineyard. But having beaten him, the farmers sent him away empty.

11. And he proceeded to send another bondman. And they, having beaten and shamefully treated, sent him also away empty.

12. And he proceeded to send a third. And they also having wounded this man, cast him out.

13. And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will be made ashamed after seeing this man.

14. But when the farmers saw him, they deliberated among themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may become ours.

15. And having cast him outside of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?

16. He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. And having heard it, they said, May it not happen!

17. But having looked upon them, he said, What then is this that is written, The stone that those who build rejected, this became the head of the corner?

18. Every man who falls on that stone will be broken, but on whomever it may fall, it will grind him to dust.

19. And the chief priests and the scholars sought to throw hands on him in the same hour. And they were afraid, for they knew that he spoke this parable against them.

20. And having watched him, they sent forth insidious men pretending themselves to be righteous, so that they might take hold of his word, in order to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.

21. And they questioned him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou speak and teach rightly, and thou do not accept a personage, but teach the way of God in truth,

22. Is it permitted for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?

23. But having perceived their craftiness, he said to them, Why do ye try me?

24. Display to me a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it? And having answered, they said, Caesar's.

25. And he said to them, Then render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.

26. And they were unable to lay hold of his word before the people. And having marveled at his answer, they were silent.

27. And some of the Sadducees having approached, those who say there is no resurrection, they questioned him,

28. saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, if any brother dies, having a wife, and this man dies childless, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.

29. There were therefore seven brothers. And the first having taken a wife, died childless.

30. And the second took the woman, and this man died childless.

31. And the third likewise took her, and likewise also the seven; they left behind no children, and died.

32. And last of all the woman also died.

33. In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them does she become? For the seven had her as wife.

34. And having answered, Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage,

35. but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.

36. For neither can they die any more, for they are like the agents, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

37. But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the Bush when he calls the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.

39. And some of the scholars having answered, they said, Teacher, thou said well.

40. For they no longer dared to question him anything.

41. And he said to them, How do they say the Christ is David's son?

42. Even David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,

43. until I will place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet.

44. David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?

45. And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,

46. Beware of the scholars, who desire to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at the feasts,

47. who devour widows' houses, and in pretence make long prayers. These will receive greater damnation.

## Luke 21

1. And having looked up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury.

2. And he also saw a certain poor widow there casting in two mites.

3. And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow cast in more than they all.

4. For all these cast into the offerings of God from their abundance, but this woman from her poverty cast in all the living that she had.

5. And as some spoke about the temple, that it was adorned with fine stones and gifts, he said,

6. These things that ye see, the days will come during which there will not be left a stone upon a stone that will not be thrown down.

7. And they questioned him, saying, Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what is the sign when these things are going to happen?

8. And he said, Watch that ye may not be led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, I am, and, The time has come near. Go ye not therefore after them.

9. And when ye may hear of wars and tumults, do not be alarmed, for these things must first happen, but the end is not straightaway.

10. Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. And great earthquakes will be in various places, and famines and plagues. And there will be fearful sights and great signs from the sky.

12. But before all these things, they will throw their hands on you, and will persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.

13. But it will go out from you for testimony.

14. Settle therefore in your hearts not to premeditate to make defense.

15. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom that all those who oppose you will not be able to contradict or to resist.

16. And ye will be betrayed even by parents, and kinsmen, and friends, and brothers. And some of you they will condemn to death.

17. And ye will be hated by all men because of my name.

18. And, no, not a hair of your head will perish.

19. In your perseverance ye gain your souls.

20. But when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that the desolation of it has come near.

21. Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those in the midst of it depart out, and let not those in the rural areas enter into it.

22. Because these are days of vengeance to fulfill all things that are written.

23. But woe to those who have in the womb, and to those who suckle in those days. For there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.

24. And they will fall by the jaw of the sword, and will be led away captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

25. And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, roaring of sea and of tossing,

26. fainting of men from fear, and of anticipation of the things coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

27. And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and much glory.

28. And when these things begin to happen, stand upright, and lift up your heads, because your redemption approaches.

29. And he spoke a parable to them. Behold the fig tree, and all the trees.

30. When they are now sprouting, ye know seeing for yourselves that summer is now near.

31. Even so ye, when ye see these things happening, know ye that the kingdom of God is near.

32. Truly I say to you, that this generation will, no, not pass away until all things happen.

33. The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words may, no, not pass away.

34. But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down in debauchery and drunkenness and mundane cares, and that day come upon you sudden.

35. For it will come like a trap upon all those who sit upon the face of all the earth.

36. Watch ye therefore, making supplication at all times, so that ye may be considered worthy to escape all these things going to happen, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. And during the days he was teaching in the temple, and going forth the nights, he lodged on the mount that is called Olives.

38. And all the people rose early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.

## Luke 22

1. Now the feast of unleavened bread was coming near, which is called Passover.

2. And the chief priests and the scholars sought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.

3. And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

4. And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.

5. And they were glad, and agreed together to give him silver.

6. And he consented and sought opportunity to betray him to them apart from the multitude.

7. And the day of unleavened bread came during which it was necessary to kill the Passover.

8. And he sent Peter and John, saying, After departing, prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.

9. And they said to him, Where do thou want that we should prepare?

10. And he said to them, Behold, having entered into the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house where he enters.

11. And ye shall say to the house-ruler, The teacher says to thee, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

12. And he will show you a large upper room furnished. Prepare there.

13. And having gone, they found just as he said to them, and they prepared the Passover.

14. And when the hour came, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

15. And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before my suffering.

16. For I say to you, that I will eat of it no more, no, not till when it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And having taken a cup, having expressed thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves.

18. For I say to you, that I will, no, not drink from the fruit of the grapevine till when the kingdom of God comes.

19. And after taking bread, having expressed thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to them, saying, This is my body that is given for you. Do ye this in my memory.

20. Likewise also the cup after dining, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood being shed for you.

21. Nevertheless behold, the hand of the man who betrays me is with me on the table.

22. And the Son of man indeed goes according to that which has been determined, nevertheless woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!

23. And they began to question among themselves who then of them would be going do this thing.

24. And also a dispute develop among them, which of them is considered to be greater.

25. And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles have dominion over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.

26. But ye are not this way. Rather, the greater among you, shall become as the newer, and he who leads, as he who serves.

27. For who ranks higher, he who sits dining, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits dining? But I am in the midst of you as he who serves.

28. But ye are those who have continued with me in my trials.

29. And I appoint to you, just as my Father appointed to me a kingdom,

30. that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you to sift you as wheat,

32. but I prayed for thee, so that thy faith may not fail. And thou, when thou have returned, strengthen thy brothers.

33. And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.

34. And he said, I say to thee, Peter, a cock will, no, not sound today, before thou will thrice deny that thou know me.

35. And he said to them, When I sent you without bag and pouch and shoes, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing.

36. Then he said to them, But now, he who has a bag, let him take it, and likewise a pouch. And he who has no sword, let him sell his cloak and buy.

37. For I say to you, that this that is written is still necessary to be completed in me, And he was counted with lawless men, for these things about me also have fulfillment.

38. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.

39. And having come out, he proceeded according to his habit to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.

40. And when he came at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.

41. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw. And he knelt down and prayed,

42. saying, Father, if thou want, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.

43. And an agent from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.

44. And having become in agony he prayed more intensely, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down to the ground.

45. And after rising up from his prayer, having come to the disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.

46. And said to them, Why sleep ye? Having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.

47. While he yet spoke, behold, a multitude, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them. And he came near to Jesus to kiss him.

48. But Jesus said to him, Judas, thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?

49. And when those who were around him saw what would be, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

50. And a certain one of them struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. But having answered, Jesus said, Allow ye as far as this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.

52. And Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, who came to him, Have ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?

53. When I was with you daily in the temple, ye did not stretch forth hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

54. And having seized him, they led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from afar.

55. And having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.

56. But a certain servant girl having seen him sitting near the light, and having looked intently upon him, she said, This man was also with him.

57. But he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not know him.

58. And after a little while, another man having see him, said, Thou also are from them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

59. And about one hour having passed, some other man insisted, saying, In truth this man was also with him, for he is also a Galilean.

60. And Peter said, Man, I do not know what thou are saying. And immediately, while he still spoke, a cock sounded.

61. And having turned, the Lord looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before a cock sounds thou will deny me thrice.

62. And having gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.

63. And the men who held Jesus mocked him, while striking him.

64. And having covered him, they struck his face, and demanded him, saying, Prophesy! Who is he who struck thee?

65. And they spoke many other things against him, railing against him.

66. And when it became day, the eldership of the people, the chief priests, and the scholars, came together, and led him into their council, saying,

67. If thou are the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe,

68. and if I also ask, ye will, no, not answer nor release.

69. From henceforth the Son of man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.

70. And they all said, Therefore thou are the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.

71. And they said, What further need have we of testimony? For we have heard from his mouth.

## Luke 23

1. And having risen, the whole company of them led him to Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ, a king.

3. And Pilate questioned him, saying, Are thou the king of the Jews? And having answered him, he said, Thou say.

4. And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing guilty in this man.

5. But they were emphatic, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, having begun from Galilee as far as here.

6. And when Pilate heard Galilee, he questioned if the man is a Galilean.

7. And when he perceived that he is from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem in these days.

8. Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he was wanting of a considerable time to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he hoped to see some sign happening by him.

9. And he interrogated him in considerable words, but he answered him nothing.

10. And the chief priests and the scholars had stood, vehemently accusing him.

11. But Herod having disdained him with his soldiers, and having mocked him, having arraying him in a bright robe, he sent him back to Pilate.

12. And both Pilate and Herod became friends with each other on the same day, for they were formerly being at enmity toward themselves.

13. And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,

14. said to them, Ye brought this man to me as turning away the people. And behold, I, having examined him before you, found nothing guilty in this man of what ye accuse against him.

15. But not even Herod, for I sent you back to him, and lo, nothing having been done by him is worthy of death.

16. Therefore, having scourged I will release him.

17. Now he had need to release one man to them at every feast.

18. But they cried out all together, saying, Take away this man, and release to us Barabbas

19. (a man who was cast into prison because of a certain insurrection that occurred in the city, and for murder).

20. Again therefore Pilate called out wanting to release Jesus,

21. but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.

22. And he said to them a third time, For what evil did this man do? I have found nothing guilty of death in him. I will therefore, having scourged, release him.

23. But they were relentless with loud voices demanding him to be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.

24. And Pilate decreed their request to happen.

25. And he released the man who had been cast into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they asked for, but he delivered Jesus to their will.

26. And when they led him away, having taken hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the countryside, they laid the cross on him to bring behind Jesus.

27. And a great multitude of the people followed him, and also of women who bewailed and lamented him.

28. But having turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, instead weep for yourselves and for your children.

29. Because, behold, the days are coming, during which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the bellies that gave no birth, and the breasts that did not suckle.

30. Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us.

31. Because if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?

32. And two other men, malefactors, were also led with him to be executed.

33. And when they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one at the right hand and the other at the left.

34. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. And dividing his garments, they cast a lot.

35. And the people had stood watching. And also the rulers with them sneered, saying, He saved others. He should save himself, if this is the Christ, the chosen of God.

36. And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar,

37. and saying, If thou are the king of the Jews, save thyself.

38. And there was also an inscription over him written in letters, in Greek and Latin and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed him, saying, If thou are the Christ, save thyself and us.

40. But the other man having answered, rebuking him, saying, Thou fear not even God, since thou are in the same condemnation?

41. And we indeed justly, for we receive worthy of what we did, but this man did nothing amiss.

42. And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou come into thy kingdom.

43. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to thee, today thou will be with me in the paradise.

44. And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness occurred over the whole land until the ninth hour.

45. And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in the middle.

46. And Jesus, having sounded out in a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands I entrust my spirit. And having said these things, he expired.

47. And when the centurion saw that which happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.

48. And all the multitudes who came together to this scene, watching that which happened, turned back, beating their breasts.

49. And all his acquaintances, and the women who accompanied him from Galilee, had stood from afar, seeing these things.

50. And behold a man named Joseph, a council member, being a good and righteous man

51. (this man not having consented to their purpose and deed), was from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also himself awaited the kingdom of God.

52. This man having gone to Pilate, requested the body of Jesus.

53. And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher cut in rock, of which no man was yet lain.

54. And the day was Preparation; sabbath was beginning.

55. And having followed closely, the women who were gathered to him out of Galilee, they saw the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.

56. And having returned, they prepared spices and ointments. And they indeed rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.

## Luke 24

1. And on the first day of the week, very early morning, they came to the sepulcher bringing the spices that they prepared, and some women with them.

2. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.

3. And having entered in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it came to pass while they were bewildered about this, that behold, two men stood near them in shining apparel.

5. And since they became frightened and bowing down their face to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, but was raised. Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,

7. saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day to rise.

8. And they remembered his sayings.

9. And having returned from the sepulcher, they reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the others.

10. Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.

11. And their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they disbelieved them.

12. But having risen, Peter ran to the sepulcher. And having stooped down, he sees the linen cloths laying alone. And he departed, wondering to himself at that which happened.

13. And behold, two of them were going the same day to a village that was sixty furlongs away from Jerusalem, which name was Emmaus.

14. And they conversed with each other about all these things that happened.

15. And it came to pass, while they conversed and discussed, that Jesus himself also having approached, went along with them.

16. But their eyes were held, not to recognize him.

17. And he said to them, What are these words that ye toss back to each other, while walking and are looking sad.

18. And one, whose name was Cleopas, having answered, said to him, Thou only visit Jerusalem and do not know the things that happened in it during these days?

19. And he said to them, What? And they said to him, The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet, a mighty man in work and word before God and all the people,

20. and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up for condemnation of death, and crucified him.

21. But we hoped that he is the man who is going to redeem Israel. But even with all these things, it brings this third day today from which time these things happened.

22. But also some of our women astonished us, having come to be at the sepulcher early morning.

23. And not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen a vision of agents who say he is alive.

24. And some of those with us went to the sepulcher, and found it this way, just as also the women said, but they did not see him.

25. And he said to them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets spoke.

26. Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?

27. And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things about himself.

28. And they came near to the village where they were going, and he pretended to go further.

29. And they constrained him, saying, Remain with us, because it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.

30. And it came to pass during his dining with them, that, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken in pieces he gave to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he became invisible from them.

32. And they said to each other, Was not our heart burning within us while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?

33. And having risen up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven gathered together,

34. and those who were with them who said, The Lord really was raised, and was seen by Simon.

35. And they reported the things on the road, and how he was made known to them during the breaking of the bread.

36. And as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them, Peace to you.

37. But having been startled, and having become frightened, they presumed to see a spirit.

38. And he said to them, Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

39. See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as ye see me having.

40. And having said this, he displayed to them his hands and feet.

41. And while they still disbelieved from joy and wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything to eat here?

42. And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and from a bees honeycomb.

43. And having taken it, he ate before them.

44. And he said to them, These are the words that I spoke to you while still being with you, that it is necessary for all things that are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms about me to be fulfilled.

45. Then he opened their mind to understand the scriptures.

46. And he said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day,

47. and to proclaim in his name repentance and remission of sins for all the nations, having begun from Jerusalem.

48. And ye are witnesses of these things.

49. And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But stay ye in the city until ye are clothed with power from on high.

50. And he led them outside as far as to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.

51. And it came to pass while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was brought up into heaven.

52. And having worshiping him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

53. and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Truly.
