# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. Paul and Timothy, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the sanctified in Jesus Christ who are at Philippi, with the guardians and helpers:

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. I thank my God upon every memory of you,

4. always in my every entreaty for all of you, making the entreaty with joy

5. for your participation in the good news from the first day until now.

6. Being confident of this same thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.

7. Just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the good news, you all being partners with me of the grace.

8. For God is my witness, how I long for you all in bowels of Jesus Christ.

9. And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment

10. for you to examine the things that are significant. So that ye may be tested by sunlight and not stumbling toward the day of Christ,

11. having been filled with fruits of righteousness, through Jesus Christ, for glory and praise of God.

12. But I want you to know, brothers, that the things in respect to me have come more for the advancement of the good news,

13. in order for my bonds in Christ to become apparent in the whole Praetorium, and in all the others.

14. And more of the brothers in the Lord have been convinced by my bonds to be much more bold to speak the word fearlessly.

15. Actually some even preach the Christ because of envy and strife, and some also because of good-will.

16. Some indeed proclaim the Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to bring affliction to my bonds.

17. But some from love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the good news.

18. What then? Except in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice, but also I will rejoice.

19. For I know that this will turn out to me for salvation (through your entreaty, and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ)

20. according to my eager expectation and hope that I will be shamed in nothing. But with all boldness, now as always, Christ will also be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.

21. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

22. But if to live in flesh, this is fruit of labor to me, then what I will choose I know not.

23. And I am constrained by the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, being far better.

24. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary because of you.

25. And having been convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and will continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith.

26. So that your pride may abound in Christ Jesus in me because of my presence with you again.

27. Only be citizens worthy of the good news of the Christ, so that, whether having come and having seen you or being absent, I may hear things about you that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the good news.

28. And not being frightened in anything by those who oppose, which is indeed a sign of destruction to them, but to you of salvation, and this from God.

29. Because to you it was granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,

30. having the same conflict such as ye saw in me, and now hear is in me.

## Philippians 2

1. If therefore any exhortation is in Christ, if any encouragement of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

2. fulfill my joy, that ye may think the same way, having the same love, being knit in soul, thinking in oneness,

3. in nothing according to selfish ambition or empty conceit, but in humility considering each other surpassing yourselves.

4. Look ye out each man not to things of yourselves, but each man also to the things of others.

5. Indeed have this way to think in you, that also was in Christ Jesus,

6. who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal to God something to seize and hold.

7. But he emptied himself, having taken a form of a bondman, having become in a likeness of men.

8. And having been found in a form like a man, he lowered himself, having become obedient until death, even of death from a cross.

9. Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name above every name,

10. so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of the heavenly, and the earthly, and the sub-earthly,

11. and that every tongue should acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

12. Therefore my beloved, just as ye have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

13. For it is God who works in you both to desire and to work for approval.

14. Do all things without grumblings and arguments,

15. so that ye may become blameless and pure children of God, blameless in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.

16. Holding firm the word of life, for a boast by me in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.

17. Yet even if I am poured out a libation upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.

18. And in the same way, ye also be glad and rejoice with me.

19. But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be cheerful when I know the things about you.

20. For I have no man like-minded who will genuinely care for the things about you.

21. For they all seek the things of themselves, not the things of Christ Jesus.

22. But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child to a father, he served with me for the good news.

23. Indeed therefore I hope to send this man immediately, whenever I may focus on the things concerning me.

24. And I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come soon.

25. But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and co-workman and fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need,

26. since he was longing for you all, and distressed because ye heard that he was sick.

27. For also he was sick, near death, but God was merciful to him, and not only him, but also me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.

28. Therefore I sent him more urgently, so that having seen him again, ye may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful.

29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men esteemed.

30. Because for sake of the work of the Christ he came near the point of death, handing over his life so that he might fill up the deficiency of your service toward me.

## Philippians 3

1. Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is really not irksome to me, but safe for you.

2. Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workmen, beware of the excision.

3. For we are the circumcision, men who worship in spirit to God, and who boast in Christ Jesus, and not being confident in flesh.

4. Although (I having confidence also in flesh) if any other man seems to be confident in the flesh, I more:

5. in circumcision the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; regarding law, a Pharisee;

6. regarding zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness in law, having become blameless.

7. But whatever was gain to me, these things I regarded loss because of the Christ.

8. But indeed therefore I even consider all things to be loss because of things surpassing, of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom I suffered the loss of all things, and consider them to be rubbish, so that I may gain Christ,

9. and be found in him, not having my righteousness, that from law, but that through Christ's faith-the righteousness from God based on faith-

10. to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the participation of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,

11. if somehow I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.

12. Not that I have already obtained or have already been fully perfected, but I press forward, if also I might seize upon that for which also I was seized by Christ Jesus.

13. Brothers, I reckon myself not to have seized, but one thing, indeed forgetting the things behind, and reaching forward to the things ahead,

14. I press forward toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

15. As many therefore as are perfect should think this way. And if ye think anything differently, this also God will reveal to you.

16. However in what we have attained, to march by the same standard, to think the same way.

17. Brothers, become fellow-imitators of me, and watch those who so walk, just as ye have us for an example.

18. For many walk, who (I told you often, and now also say while weeping) are enemies of the cross of Christ,

19. whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and the glory in their shame, who mind earthly things.

20. For our citizenship exists in the heavens, from which also we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,

21. who will transform the body of our lowliness, in order for it to become similar in form to the body of his glory, according to the working of his power even to subject all things to himself.

## Philippians 4

1. So then, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord this way beloved.

2. I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.

3. Yes, I ask thee also, genuine yokefellow, help them-the women who labored with me in the good news-with Clement also, and the rest of my co-workmen whose names are in the book of life.

4. Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice.

5. Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.

6. Be anxious about nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thankfulness make your requests known to God.

7. And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

8. Finally brothers, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are commendable, if anything is a virtue, and if anything is praiseworthy, think on these things.

9. And what ye learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace will be with you.

10. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last ye have revived thinking about me, in which also ye were thinking, but ye lacked opportunity.

11. Not that I speak regarding need, for I have learned in what things I am to be content.

12. I know both how to be abased and how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be lacking.

13. I can do all things in the Christ who strengthens me.

14. Nevertheless ye did well having shared with my affliction.

15. And ye Philippians also have seen that, in the beginning of the good news when I departed from Macedonia, not one congregation shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except ye only,

16. because also in Thessalonica ye sent both once and again to my need.

17. Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account.

18. But I receive all things, and I abound. I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, an aroma of fragrance, an acceptable sacrifice well-pleasing to God.

19. And my God will fill your every need according to his wealth in glory in Christ Jesus.

20. Now to our God and Father is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.

21. Salute every sanctified man in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me salute you.

22. All the sanctified salute you, and especially those of the house of Caesar.

23. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with you all. Truly.
