# Matthew

## Matthew 1

__(Writer: Matthew) (Hebrew: Mattithiah, means Gift of Jehovah) (41 C.E.) (Palestine)__

1. The list of ancestors of Jesus Christ, descendant of David and Abraham:

2. Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.

3. Judah and Tamar were the father and mother of Perez and Zerah. Perez was the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,

4. Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon.

5. Salmon and Rahab were the father and mother of Boaz. Boaz and Ruth were the father and mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse,

6. Jesse the father of King David. David and Uriahs wife Bath-sheba were the father and mother of Solomon.

7. Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,

8. Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,

9. Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,

10. Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah.

11. Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. They lived at the time when the people were exiled to Babylon.

12. After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel,

13. Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,

14. Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,

15. Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob.

16. Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ the Anointed.

17. So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations from the exile until the Messiah.

18. The birth genesis: originbeginning of Jesus Christ was as follows: His mother Mary had been promised to Joseph in marriage. But before they were married, Mary realized that she was pregnant by Holy Spirit.

19. Her husband Joseph was an honorable man and did not want to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to break the marriage agreement with her secretly.

20. Joseph had this in mind when Gods angel appeared to him in a dream. The angel said to him: »Joseph, descendant of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. She is pregnant by Holy Spirit.

21. »She will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus »Jehovah is salvation« , because he will save his people from their sins.«

22. All this happened so that what God spoke through the prophet came true:

23. »The virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel,« which means: »God God-like one is with us.« (John 1:18)

24. When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of God had commanded him to do. He took Mary to be his wife.

25. He did not have marital relations with her before she gave birth to a son. Joseph named the child Jesus.

## Matthew 2

1. Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the reign of King Herod. Astrologers arrived in Jerusalem from the east.

2. They asked: »Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and came to offer him praise.«

3. King Herod was troubled when he heard this. Jerusalem was also troubled.

4. He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law and asked where will the Messiah be born?

5. »Bethlehem in Judea,« they answered. This is what the prophet wrote:

6. »Bethlehem in the land of Judah, you are not the least of the leading cities of Judah. A leader will come out of you. He will shepherd my people Israel.«

7. Then Herod secretly called the astrologers to find out exactly the time the star appeared.

8. He sent them to Bethlehem. He said: »Search diligently for the young child. When you find him, bring me word so I may come and bow down to him also.«

9. After they heard the king, they followed the star until it stopped over the place where the child was.

10. They were overwhelmed with joy to see the star.

11. They entered the house and saw the young child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and paid him homage. Then they opened their treasure chests and offered gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.

12. God warned the astrologers in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they departed for their country by a different road.

13. When they left, the angel of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: »Herod is looking to kill the young child. Arise, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to leave.«

14. Joseph took the child and his mother to Egypt.

15. They did not return until the death of Herod. The words spoken by Jehovah through the prophet were fulfilled: »I called my son out of Egypt.« (Hosea 11:1)

16. Herod saw that the astrologers tricked him and he was furious. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys two years old and younger in or near Bethlehem. This matched the time he learned from the astrologers.

17. Jeremiahs prophecy came true:

18. »A sound was heard in Ramah, the sound of crying in bitter grief. Rachel is weeping for her children. She would not be comforted, because they were dead.«

19. After Herod died Gods angel appeared in a dream to Joseph who was in Egypt.

20. The angel told him: »Take the child and his mother and go to Israel. Those who tried to kill the child are dead.«

21. Joseph took the child and his mother to Israel.

22. When he heard that Archelaus succeeded his father, Herod, as king of Judea, Joseph feared going. Warned in a dream, he left for Galilee instead.

23. He made his home in Nazareth. Thus the prophecy came true: »He Jesus will be called a Nazarene.«

## Matthew 3

1. John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming:

2. »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.«

3. Isaiah spoke of John when he said: »He is a voice shouting in the wilderness: Prepare the way of Jehovah. Make his paths straight.« (Isaiah 40:3)

4. John wore clothes made from camels hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.

5. People from Jerusalem, Judea, and the whole Jordan Valley went to him.

6. They confessed their sins and were baptized by John in the Jordan River.

7. He saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism. »You offspring of vipers,« he said, »who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. »Bear fruit worthy of repentance!

9. »Do not presume that Abraham is your father. I tell you that God can make descendants for Abraham from these stones!

10. »The ax is ready to cut down the trees at the roots. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

11. »I baptize you with water because of your repentance. He that comes after me is mightier than I. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and fire. I am not even good enough to carry his sandals.

12. »His winnowing shovel is in his hand. He will clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into a barn. He will then burn the husks in a fire that cannot be put out.«

13. Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.

14. »I need to be baptized by you,« John said. »Why are you coming to me?«

15. Jesus answered emphatically: »This is the proper way to do everything that God requires. This is the way it must be!«

16. Then Jesus was baptized and came up from the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened. He saw Gods Spirit coming down like a dove.

17. Then a voice from heaven said: »This is my Son whom I love and whom I have approved.«

## Matthew 4

1. Gods Spirit led Jesus into the desert wilderness. There he was tested tempted by the Devil.

2. He fasted forty days and nights, and was very hungry.

3. Satan, the Tempter, said to him: »If since you are the Son of God order these stones to turn into bread.«

4. In reply Jesus answered: »It is written; man shall not live on bread alone, but on all everythingevery wordevery utteranceevery declaration that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah.« (Deuteronomy 8:3)

5. Then the Devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on top of the Temple.

6. »If since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. The Scriptures say: God will give orders to his angels about you and they will hold you with their hands, so that not even your feet will strike the ground.«

7. »Again it is written,« Jesus replied, »you must not put Jehovah your God to the test.« (Deuteronomy 6:16)

8. This time the Devil took Jesus to an extremely high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world with all their greatness.

9. »I will give all this to you,« the Devil told Jesus, »if you kneel down and worship me.«

10. »Go away, Satan!« demanded Jesus. »It is written, »It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.« (Deuteronomy 6:13-15)

11. Then the Devil left Jesus, and the angels came and served him.

12. Jesus heard that John had been arrested. So Jesus withdrew to Galilee.

13. He left Nazareth to reside at Capernaum, a town by Lake Galilee, in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali.

14. Thus the prophecy revealed to Isaiah would be fulfilled:

15. »O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!

16. »the people sitting in darkness saw a great light. Light rose upon those sitting in a region of deathly shadow.«

17. From that time on Jesus preached this message: »Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is near.«

18. Jesus walked on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother. They were fishermen.

19. He said to them: »Follow me and I will teach you to catch people.«

20. At once they abandoned their nets and followed him.

21. He saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. They were in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.

22. Instantly they left the boat and their father, and went with him.

23. Jesus walked all over Galilee teaching in the synagogues. He preached the Good News about the Kingdom. He also healed every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.

24. News about him spread throughout the country of Syria. People sick and suffering from diseases, people with demons, epileptics and paralytics, came to him. Jesus healed them all.

25. Because of this, large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the land on the other side of the Jordan.

## Matthew 5

1. Seeing great masses of people, he went up to the mountain. When he was seated his disciples came to him.

2. He opened his mouth and taught them:

3. »Blessed Greek: makarios: happy, blessed are those conscious of their spiritual need, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

4. »Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

5. »Blessed are the meek gentlemildhumble, for they will inherit the earth.

6. »Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

7. »Blessed are the merciful and compassionate, for they will receive mercy and compassion.

8. »Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

9. »Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.

10. »Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.

11. »Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.

12. »Rejoice, and be filled with joy, for great is your reward in heaven. The prophets, who came before you, were also persecuted.

13. »You are the salt of the earth. If its taste goes away, how will you restore it? It is good for nothing. All you can do is throw it on the ground and walk on it.

14. »You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill may be seen by all.

15. »A light is not placed under a cover. To the contrary, it is placed on a table so all may see.

16. »Likewise, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.

17. »Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill perfectexecuteaccomplish.

18. »I solemnly tell you, heaven and earth would pass away before one small letter detail will pass away from the Law. All things must be accomplished.

19. »Whoever disobeys even the least of the commandments and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. On the other hand whoever obeys and teaches others to obey the Law will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

20. »I also tell you, your righteousness must be greater than the scribes and Pharisees or you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

21. »You were told in the past, do not murder kill. Any one who murders will be brought to trial.

22. »Now I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be guilty before the court. Whoever speaks to his brother with words of contempt shall receive condemnation before the Sanhedrin Supreme Court. Curse your brother and you will be guilty enough to be destroyed by fire, with the burning trash, at the Valley of Hinnom, outside of Jerusalem Greek: Gehenna.

23. »When making an offering at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you,

24. »leave your gift at the altar and go make peace with your brother. Then return and make your offering.

25. »Come to an agreement quickly with the one who has a legal case against you. Do it before he turns the case over to the judge and you are thrown into jail.

26. »Take it from me; you will stay in jail until you pay the very last penny of your fine.

27. »You have heard it was said, You should not commit adultery.

28. »However, I tell you that whoever looks at a woman with lustful thoughts commits adultery with her in his heart.

29. »If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away! It is better to lose a part of your body then to have your whole body destroyed in the ever-burning fires of the Valley of Hinnom.

30. »If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose part of your body, than for your whole body to be destroyed in the ever-burning fire. Figuratively: lose prospect for everlasting life; ever-burning fire means total destruction.

31. »Again, it was said, Whoever gets rid of his wife has to give her a certificate of divorce.

32. »I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except for the reason of fornication, makes her liable to commit adultery. And if she marries again, the man she marries also commits adultery.

33. »You were also told that you should keep a promise oath. Always keep your promises vows to Jehovah.

34. »I tell you, offer no promises at all, not by heaven, because it is Gods throne.

35. »Not by earth, for it is the footstool under His feet. Not by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

36. »And do not promise by your head, for you cannot even control the hair on your head.

37. »Let your answer be Yes or No. Anything more than this is from the evil one.

38. »You have heard it said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

39. »But I tell you, do not resist a wicked person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to that person.

40. »If someone takes you to court to sue you and takes your shirt, let him have your coat as well.

41. »Whoever makes you go one mile, go with him two.

42. »Give to those who ask. Lend to those who borrow.

43. »You have heard it said, You should love your neighbor and hate your enemy. (Leviticus 19:18)

44. »I say love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!

45. »You will then act as true children of your Father in heaven. He gives sunlight to both evil and good people. He sends rain for the just and the unjust.

46. »What good is there, when you love only those who love you? Even corrupt tax collectors do that!

47. »When you are kind only to your friends and brothers what makes you different from anyone else? Even people of the nations do that.

48. »Be perfect mature, even as your Father in heaven is perfect mature. (Leviticus 19:2)

## Matthew 6

1. »Be careful! Do not display your righteousness good works before men to be noticed by them. If you do, you will have no reward with your heavenly Father.

2. »Do not loudly announce it when you give to the poor. The hypocrites do this in the houses of worship and on the streets. They do this to be praised by men. Believe me, they have already been paid in full.

3. »When you give gifts, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.

4. »Your giving will be in secret and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

5. »Do not pray like the hypocrites! They want everyone to see them in the houses of worship and on the street corners. I assure you they have been paid in full.

6. »Go to your room and close the door. Privately pray to your Father. When your Father sees you he will reward you.

7. »Large quantities of meaningless words and repetition are not acceptable in prayer. The pagans think their gods will hear long and repetitious prayers.

8. »Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

__THIS IS THE WAY TO PRAY__

19. »Do not accumulate large amounts of wealth on earth. This is where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.

20. »Accumulate wealth in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

21. Your heart will be where you keep your wealth.

22. »The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eye is clear simplefocusedsingle minded, your whole body will be full of spiritual light.

23. »But if your eye is wicked, your body will be in darkness. If that light in you is really darkness, how great a darkness it must be.

24. »You cannot serve two masters. You will hate one and love the other. You will be loyal to one master and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money wealthmaterial possessions.

25. »I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. And do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is life worth more than food? And is the body worth more than clothes?

3. »Why do you see the speck in your brothers eye? Do you not consider the beam in your own eye?

4. »Will you tell your brother, I will remove the speck from your eye when there is a beam in your own eye?

5. »You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye. Then you can see to remove the speck out of your brothers eye.

8. »Everyone who asks receives. Everyone who seeks finds, and everyone who knocks will have it opened.

12. »Do for others the same as you would have them to do for you. That is the meaning of the Law and the Prophets.

13. »Enter through the narrow gate, since the gate to destruction is wide and the road that leads to destruction is wide and many enter through it.

14. »Narrow is the gate and difficult is the way to life. Only a few put forth the effort. Yes, only a few people enter the narrow gate.

15. »Watch out for the false prophets. They are disguised as sheep. But in their hearts they are vicious wolves.

26. »Every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.

27. »The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and battered the house and it fell with a great crash.«

28. When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at what he taught.

29. He taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.

## Matthew 8

1. When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.

2. A leper came to him and bowed down before him, saying: »Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.«

3. He reached out his hand and touched him, saying: »I want to. Be made clean.« Right away his leprosy was cleansed.

4. Jesus told him not to tell anyone. »Show yourself to the priests and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.«

5. When he entered Capernaum, a centurion captain of one hundred men approached him.

6. He said: »Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home and terribly tormented.«

7. Jesus said to him: »I will come and heal him.«

8. The centurion replied to Jesus: »Lord, I am not worthy that you come under my roof. Say the word and my servant will be healed.

9. »I also am a man having authority and commanding soldiers. I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«

10. When Jesus heard it, he was amazed, and said to the crowd: »I tell you, I have not found such great faith in Israel.

11. »I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:

12. »but the sons of the kingdom will be cast forth into the outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«

13. Jesus said to the centurion: »Go. Just as you believe, so it will be done to you.« The servant was healed in that hour.

14. Jesus went to Peters house. He saw his wifes mother lying sick of a fever.

15. He touched her hand and the fever left her. She arose, and ministered to him.

16. That evening, they brought many people possessed with demons to him. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick.

17. In so doing, that which was spoken through Isaiah was fulfilled. Isaiah wrote: »He took our sicknesses and removed our diseases.«

18. Now when Jesus saw how large the crowd was growing, he gave orders to depart to the other side of the lake.

19. A scribe came to him and said: »Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.«

20. Jesus replied: »Foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.«

21. One of his disciples said: »Lord, first allow me to go bury my father.«

22. But Jesus said to him: »Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.«

23. When he entered a boat, his disciples followed him.

24. Suddenly a storm blew in and the boat was covered with waves. Jesus was asleep.

25. And they came to him, woke him, and cried: »Save us, Lord, or we will perish.«

26. He said to them: »Why are you afraid, you of little faith?« Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea. Suddenly there was a great calm.

27. The disciples were in awe. They asked: »What kind of man is this, for even the winds and the sea obey him?«

28. When he arrived at the other side of the lake in the country of the Gadarenes two men possessed by demons came to him from out of the tombs. They were extremely violent, so no man could pass by that way.

29. They screamed at him, saying: »What have we to do with you, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the time?«

30. A large herd of swine was feeding in the distance.

31. The demons pleaded with him: »If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine!«

32. He told them to go. And they came out, and went into the swine. The entire herd rushed down the hill into the sea, where they perished in the waters.

33. The herdsmen fled to the city to tell everything that happened to the swine that were possessed with demons.

34. Everyone in the city came out to meet Jesus. They begged him to go away from their country.

## Matthew 9

1. Jesus entered a boat and crossed over to his own city Capernaum, on the other side of the lake.

2. A man on a bed, a paralytic, was brought to Jesus. Seeing their faith Jesus said to the sick man: »Have courage; your sins are forgiven.«

3. Some of the scribes said among themselves: »This man has no respect for God.«

4. Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said: »Why are your thoughts evil?

5. »Which is easier, to say, your sins are forgiven, or to say, get up and walk?«

6. So that you know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he turned and spoke to the paralytic or paralyzed man: »Get up, take your bed and go to your house.«

7. He arose, and departed to his house.

8. But when the people saw it, they marveled, and glorified God who had given such authority to men.

9. Jesus moved on. He then saw Matthew seated at his work collecting taxes. He said to him: »Follow me.« He rose and followed him.

10. Jesus was a dinner guest at Matthews house. Many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

11. When the Pharisees saw it, they asked his disciples: »Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?«

12. When he heard it, he said: »People who are well do not have need of a physician. The sick do.

13. »You should learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; for I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners.«

14. The disciples of John asked: »Why do your disciples not fast?« They frequently fasted, and so did the Pharisees.

15. Jesus replied: »Should the wedding guests mourn and also celebrate with the groom? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.

16. »Why patch an old garment with cloth that has not been shrunk? The patch shrinks and pulls away from the old cloth leaving a big hole.

17. »Neither do men put new wine in old wineskins. The skins burst and the wine is lost. They put new wine in fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.«

18. While he was speaking, an official came and paid him respect. He said: »By now my daughter must be dead. Come and lay your hand on her and she will live.«

19. Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.

20. A woman who had a hemorrhage chronic flow of blood for twelve years came behind him. She touched the border of his garment.

21. She said to herself: »If I touch his garment, I will be healed.«

22. Jesus turned to see her and said: »Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.« The woman was healed at that time.

23. Jesus went into the officials house and saw flute players and the crowd making a lot of noise.

24. He told them to leave: »For the girl is not dead, but sleeps.« They all scornfully laughed at him.

25. The people were sent away. He went to the girl, took hold of her hand, and she got up.

26. The news about this spread to all the land.

27. Jesus left that place and walked along the road. Two blind men followed him. They shouted: »Have mercy on us, Son of David!«

28. He went into a nearby house. The blind men followed him. Jesus asked them: »Do you believe that I can heal you?« They said: »Yes Lord.«

29. He touched their eyes. »Let it be done,« he said, »according to your faith.«

30. Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly warned them: »Do not let anyone know about this.«

31. They spread the news about Jesus all over that part of the country.

32. Next, a dumb man possessed with a demon was brought to him.

33. When the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke. The crowd marveled, saying: »We have never seen anything like this in Israel!«

34. The Pharisees complained: »He casts out demons with the help of the ruler of the demons.«

35. Jesus went to all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom. He healed every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.

36. When he saw the large crowds of people, he was moved with compassion for them. He knew they were distressed and scattered like sheep not having a shepherd.

37. Jesus said to his disciples: »The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.

38. »Pray that the Lord of the harvest will send out workers into his harvest.«

## Matthew 10

1. He called his twelve disciples. He gave them power to cast out unclean spirits and to heal all kinds of disease and sickness.

2. The following are the names of the twelve apostles ambassadors of the good newsmessengers: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

4. Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.

5. Jesus sent the twelve. He gave them orders not to go to the people of the nations and not to go to the Samaritans.

6. He said: »Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. »Preach as you go! Announce the kingdom of heaven, for it is near.

11. »Go into a city or village and search for the worthy ones. Stay with them until you are ready to leave.

12. »When you enter the house, offer a blessing of peace.

13. »If the people are worthy, let your blessing stand. If they are not worthy, let your peace return to you.

14. »If someone will not welcome you and listen to the message, leave that house or town, shake the dust off your feet and move on.

15. »I tell you, it will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that town.

17. »Beware of men! They will take you to court! They will have you beaten in their meeting places.

18. »You will be taken before governors and kings for my sake. This will serve as a testimony to them and to the people of the nations.

19. »When they hand you over, do not worry about what to say and how to say it. You will be given the words to speak at that time.

20. »You will not speak on your own. Your Fathers Spirit will speak through you.

21. »People will hand over their brothers to be put to death. Parents will oppose children and children will oppose parents, causing them to be put to death.

23. »When they persecute you in this city, flee to the next. I tell you; before you have gone through all the cities of Israel the Son of man will come.

24. »A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant his master.

25. »It is enough for the disciple student that he is like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they called the master of the house Beelzebub Satan, others of the household could also be called the same!

26. »Do not be afraid. Nothing will be hidden. Every secret will be made known.

27. »The things I tell you in darkness, speak in the light. Proclaim everything you hear from on top of the house.

28. »Do not fear those who kill the body. They are not able to take away your everlasting life. Instead, fear him who is able to destroy both life and body in the ever-burning fires. Greek: Gehenna: continuously burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom.

29. »Do two sparrows sell for a penny? Not one of them will fall on the ground without your Father knowing.

30. »Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. »Do not fear! You are more valuable than many sparrows.

32. »I will tell my heavenly Father about everyone who confesses me witnesses to others about me before men.

33. »I will deny, before my heavenly Father, anyone who denies me before men.

34. »Do not think I came to bring peace on the earth. I came not to bring peace, but a sword.

35. »My coming will cause a separation. A man will be against his father and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

36. »A mans enemies will be from his own family.

37. »He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. He who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

42. »And whoever gives a drink of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will not lose his reward.«

## Matthew 11

1. When Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left to teach and preach in their cities.

2. While in prison, John heard news of what Christ was doing. He sent his disciples.

3. They asked Jesus: »Are you the Expected One or should we look for another?«

4. And Jesus answered: »Go tell John the things you hear and see.

5. »The blind receive their sight. The lame walk! The lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear. The dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.

6. »Blessed and happy is he who is not offended by me.«

7. When these men left, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. »What did you go into the wilderness to find? Did you look for a reed shaken by the wind?

8. »What did you expect to see, a man clothed in fancy clothes? Those who wear fancy clothes are in kings houses.

9. »Did you go to see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet!

10. »This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare the way for you.

11. »I tell you, there is none, born of women, greater then John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

12. »From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been mans goal, and men of violence have attempted to take it by force.

13. »For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

14. »If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.

15. »He who has ears to hear let him listen!

16. »Of what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their playmates.

17. »They say: We piped for you and you did not dance. We cried and you did not mourn.

18. »For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.

19. »The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, A gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! Wisdom is justified by its actions.«

20. Then he denounced the cities where most of his mighty works were done, because they did not repent.

21. »Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon that were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. »I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment than for you.

23. »Will you, Capernaum, be exalted into heaven? You will go down into the grave. If the mighty works had been done in Sodom, which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.

24. »But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment, than for you.«

25. Then Jesus prayed: »I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and have revealed them to children. (Acts 2:36)

26. »Yes, Father, for it was very pleasing in your sight.

27. »All things have been delivered to me from my Father. Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father. The Son tells others about the Father so that they can know him too.

28. »Come unto me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.

29. »Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me. I am meek mild and humble in heart. You will have a restful life,

30. » for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.«

## Matthew 12

1. Jesus disciples were hungry. It was Sabbath day and yet Jesus and his disciples went through the grain fields plucking ears and eating them.

2. The Pharisees saw it and said to him: »Your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.«

3. He replied to them: »Have you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

4. »He entered into the house of God, and he and his companions ate the showbread holy bread, which it was not lawful for them to eat. It was only lawful for the priests.

5. »Have you read the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?

6. »I say to you, one greater than the Temple is here.

7. »If you had known what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.

8. »For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.«

9. He left and went into their synagogue.

10. There he saw a man who had a withered hand. They asked him if it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? They wanted to accuse him.

11. He said to them: »Which of you having one sheep, if this sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not get it and lift it out.

12. »How much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day!«

13. Then he said to the man: »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out and it was restored whole like the other.

14. The Pharisees left and took counsel against him, to decide how they might destroy him.

15. Jesus was aware of this and withdrew from the place. Many followed him and were healed by him.

16. He warned them not to tell anyone where he was.

17. This fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet.

18. »Look! My servant whom I have chosen. I am well pleased with him. I will put my Spirit upon him and he will declare judgment to the nations.

19. »He will not quarrel, nor cry aloud. None will hear his voice in the streets.

20. »He will break a bruised reed. He will quench smoking flax. This he will do until he sends forth judgment to victory.

21. »The nations will hope in his name!«

22. Someone possessed with a demon, blind and dumb was brought to him. He healed him and the dumb man spoke and could see.

23. The crowds were amazed, and said: »Can this be the son of David?«

24. When the Pharisees heard it, they said: »This man casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of the demons.«

25. Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: »Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed. Every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

26. »If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How will his kingdom stand?

27. »If I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Let them be your judges.

28. »But if I cast out demons by Gods Spirit, then the kingdom of God has come to you.

29. »How can one enter into the house of a strong man and steal his things, except he first tie up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.

30. »He that is not with me is against me. And he that does not gather with me, scatters.

31. »Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men. But the blasphemy against Gods Spirit will not be forgiven.

32. »Whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.

33. »Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt. The fruit a tree produces provides its reputation.

34. »You offspring of vipers. How can you who are evil speak good things? Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. »The good man performs good things out of his good treasure. The evil man performs evil things out of his evil treasure.

36. »I tell you there will be an account in the Judgment Day for every careless word that men say.

37. »For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.«

38. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: »Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.«

39. He answered them: »An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign. No sign will be given but the sign of Jonah the prophet.

40. »Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish, so the Son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the grave.

41. »The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it. After all, they repented at the preaching of Jonah. Yet someone greater than Jonah is here.

42. »The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it. She came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon. Someone greater than Solomon is here!

43. »When an unclean spirit goes out of a man it passes through the desert seeking rest. It does not find it.

44. »It tries to return to the place from where it came. It finds it empty, swept, and fixed up.

45. »Then it takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. It will also be like this with this evil generation.«

46. While Jesus was yet speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers stood nearby. They wanted to speak to him.

47. Someone told Jesus: »Look, your mother and your brothers stand nearby seeking to speak to you.«

48. But he answered: »Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?«

49. He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said: »Behold, my mother and my brothers!

50. »For everyone who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother.«

## Matthew 13

1. That day Jesus left the house and sat by the seashore.

2. Large crowds gathered to him. He entered a boat while the crowd stood on the shore.

3. He told them many illustrations. He said: »A farmer went out to sow.

4. »Some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds devoured them.

5. »Others fell on rocky places and did not have much soil.

6. »When they grew, the sun scorched them, and because they had no root they withered and died.

7. »Others fell upon the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.

8. »Some fell on good ground and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.

9. »He that has ears let him hear.«

10. The disciples asked him: »Why do you speak in illustrations?«

11. He responded: »You are allowed to know the divine secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it is not for others to know. The Greek word for »you« is plural and is applied to the disciples as a group.

12. »He who has shall receive more to the point of abundance. He who does not have, it shall be taken away including that which he has.

13. »I speak to them in illustrations storiesparablesallegories, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear. They just do not understand.

14. »The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled. By hearing, you shall hear, and shall in no way understand. By seeing you shall see, and shall in no way perceive.

15. »The heart of this people is callous and dull. Their ears are plugged. They cannot hear. They closed their eyes and cannot see. They cannot see nor hear nor understand with their heart. They should turn around and I would heal them.

16. »Happy and blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.

17. »Truly, I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see, and could not see them. They also desired to hear the things that you hear, and could not hear them.

18. »Listen to the illustration of the sower.

19. »When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one takes away that which was sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.

20. »Anyone sown among the rocky places hears the word and immediately with joy receives it.

21. »There is no root in him. He endures for a while. When he has tribulation or persecution because of the word, he falls away.

22. »He that was sown among thorns hears the word. The cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

23. »He that was sown upon the good ground hears the word, and understands it. He bears fruit, producing sometimes a hundredfold, sometimes sixty, and sometimes thirty.«

24. He told another illustration, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a man that sowed good seed in his field.

25. »While he slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds with the wheat, and went away.

26. »When the blade sprouted and brought forth fruit, it looked like wheat.

27. »The servants of the householder said to him: Sir, did you sow good seed in your field? Why does it have weeds mixed in with the good wheat?

28. »He replied: An enemy did this. The servants offered to remove the weeds.

29. »He said: No, you might uproot the wheat with them.

30. »Let both grow together until the harvest. In the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: »Gather weeds first, and bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat into my barn.« «

31. In another illustration Jesus said: »The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man sowed in his field.

32. »Mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. Yet when it grows it becomes as large as a tree. In fact the birds of heaven lodge in the branches.«

33. He offered another illustration: »The kingdom of heaven is similar to leaven. A woman hid leaven in three measures of meal until it was all leavened.«

34. Jesus spoke with illustrations to the crowds. He did not speak anything without using illustrations.

35. That which was spoken through the prophet was fulfilled, saying: »I will open my mouth in illustrations. I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.«

36. Then he left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples gathered near him. They said: »Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field.«

37. Jesus said: »He that sows the good seed is the Son of man.

38. »The field is the world the society of mankind. The good seed are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one.

39. »The enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age. The reapers are angels.

40. »The weeds are gathered up and burned destroyed with fire. It will be this way at the end of the age.

41. »The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all who stumble others and commit lawlessness.

42. »The angels will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

43. »The righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears let him hear.

44. »The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found the treasure and hid it again in the field. He is so filled with joy he sells everything he owns and buys the field.

45. »The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchant seeking valuable pearls.

46. »When he found one pearl of great value, he sold all that he had, and bought it.

47. »The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea. It gathered fish of every kind.

48. »They drew it up on the beach when it was full. They gathered the good into containers and threw away the bad.

49. »It will be that way at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous.

50. »The wicked will be cast into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

51. »Have you understood all these things?« They said to him: »Yes.«

52. And he said to them: »Every scribe journalistwriter who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.«

53. After Jesus finished telling these illustrations, he left.

54. He went to his own country and taught in the synagogue. They were astonished and asked where this man got this wisdom and these mighty works.

55. »Is this man the carpenters son? Is his mother called Mary? Are his brothers James and Joseph, Simon, and Judas?

56. »Are his sisters all with us? Where did he get all these things?«

57. They resented him. But Jesus responded to them: »A prophet is without honor in his own country, and in his own house.«

58. He did not do many mighty works there because of their lack of faith.

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard the news about Jesus.

2. He told his servants: »This is John the Baptist, raised from the dead. That explains the power working in him.«

3. Herod locked John in prison to please Herodias, his brother Philips wife.

4. For John had said to him: »It is not lawful for you to have her.«

5. Herod wanted to put him to death but he feared the people since they believed John was a prophet.

6. It was Herods birthday. The daughter of Herodias danced for him and pleased him.

7. So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted.

8. Prompted by her mother, she said: »Give me John the Baptists head on a platter.«

9. The king was grieved. He gave his oath and many were watching so he commanded that it be done.

10. He gave the order to behead John in prison.

11. His head was brought on a platter to the young lady. She in turn gave it to her mother.

12. John the Baptists disciples took the corpse and buried him, and then came and told Jesus.

13. When Jesus heard it, he left in a boat to a secluded place. The crowds heard this and followed him on foot from the cities.

14. He saw the great crowd, had compassion on them, and healed their sick.

15. Evening came and the disciples approached Jesus and said: »This place is desolate. Send the people away so they may go to the villages and buy themselves food.«

16. Jesus told them: »They have no need to go away: you feed them.«

17. They remarked: »We have only five loaves, and two fishes.«

18. »Bring them to me,« Jesus replied.

19. He commanded the crowd to sit down on the grass. Then he prayed. He gave the five loaves and two fishes to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.

20. And they all had plenty to eat. In fact they had twelve baskets full of food left over.

21. About five thousand men, plus women and children ate.

22. Jesus sent the disciples in a boat to the other side of the sea. He stayed there until he sent the crowd away.

23. After sending the crowd away, he went to the mountain to pray by himself. He was there alone that night.

24. But the boat was now in the middle of the sea. The wind and the waves caused great trouble.

25. Just before morning, Jesus walked to them on the water.

26. When they saw him walking on the water they were troubled. »It is a spirit apparitionillusion!« they screamed! They cried out with fear.

27. At once Jesus said: »It is I; do not be afraid.«

28. Peter said to him: »Lord, if it is you, give me the order to come to you on the water.«

29. He said: »Come.« Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.

30. When he noticed how strong the wind was, he became afraid. He began to sink, and cried: »Help me Lord!«

31. Suddenly, Jesus put out his hand and took hold of him, and said: »You of little faith, why were you in doubt?«

32. The wind went down when they got into the boat.

33. Those on the boat loved him intensely, saying: »Truly, you are the Son of God!«

34. They came to land at Gennesaret.

35. When the men of that place heard the news about Jesus they told everyone in the country. The sick were taken to him.

36. They wanted to touch his robe to be made well.

## Matthew 15

1. Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus.

2. They questioned him: »Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers? They eat food with unwashed hands.«

3. His answer to them was in the form of a question: »Why do you go against the word of God in favor of your tradition?

4. »God said, Honor your father and mother. He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death.

5. »You teach that a man should tell his father or mother that what he has that could help them, is given to God.

6. »You say there is no need for him to give honor to his father. You have invalidated the word of God because of your tradition!

7. »You hypocrites liars! Isaiahs prophecy was right about you.

8. »These people honor me with their lips, but their heart innermost thoughts is far from me.

9. »But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules commands of men.«

10. He got the people together and said to them: »Listen, and let my words be clear to you.

11. »That which comes out of the mouth makes a man unclean, not that which goes into the mouth.«

12. The disciples told him the Pharisees were upset by what he said.

13. In answer he replied: »Every plant my Father in heaven has not planted in the earth will be pulled out by the roots.

14. »Let them be. They are blind guides. If a blind man guides another blind man, they will fall in a hole together.«

15. Then Peter said to him: »Make the story clear to us.«

16. He replied: »Are you, like them, without wisdom?

17. »Do you not see, that which goes into the mouth, goes into the stomach and is sent out as waste?

18. »That which comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart and makes a man unclean.

19. »Evil thoughts come from the heart! Thoughts about murder, adultery, fornication, theft, lying, and slander come from the heart!

20. »These things make a man unclean. Eating food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean.«

21. Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon.

22. A woman of Canaan came crying and saying: »Have pity on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit.«

23. He did not answer her. His disciples said to him: »Send her away; she keeps shouting at us.«

24. He answered: »I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel.«

25. She bowed down before him and asked for help.

26. He said: »It is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs.«

27. She said: »Yes, Lord; but even the dogs take the scraps from under their masters table.«

28. »O woman,« Jesus replied, »your faith is great! Let your desire be done.« And her daughter was made well from that hour.

29. Jesus went from there to the Sea of Galilee. He went up into the mountain and sat down.

30. Many people came to him. They brought those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many other people. They laid them down at his feet and he healed them.

31. The people marveled as they saw the mute speak, the crippled and lame walk, and the blind see. They glorified the God of Israel.

32. Jesus called his disciples and said: »I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.«

33. The disciples replied: »Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?«

34. Jesus asked: »How many loaves do you have?« They said: »Seven, and a few small fish.«

35. He told the people to sit down on the ground.

36. He took the seven loaves and the fish and offered a prayer of thanksgiving. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. The disciples gave them to the people.

37. They all ate and were satisfied. When they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, there were seven large baskets full.

38. Four thousand men, besides women and children were fed.

39. After dismissing the crowds, Jesus took a boat to the region of Magadan.

## Matthew 16

1. The Pharisees and Sadducees tested Jesus by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.

2. He said to them, »At nightfall you say the weather will be good, for the sky is red.

3. »And in the morning, the weather will be bad today for the sky is red and angry. You are able to see the face of heaven, but not the signs of the time.

4. »An evil and false generation is searching after a sign. However, no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.« Then he left them.

5. The disciples came from the other side of the sea. They did not think to obtain bread.

6. Jesus said: »Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«

7. They reasoned among themselves, saying: »We took no bread.«

8. Hearing this, Jesus said: »You of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves about not having bread?

9. »Do you still not see or remember the five cakes of bread of the five thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?

10. »Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?

11. »Why do you not understand I was not talking about bread? Instead, about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?«

12. Then they realized it was not the leaven of bread he had in mind. It was the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13. Jesus traveled to parts of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples: »Who do men say that the Son of man is?«

14. They said: »John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.«

15. »Who do you say that I am?«

16. Simon Peter answered: »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!«

17. Jesus answered him: »Bless you, Simon son of John. This knowledge came from my Father in heaven and not from man.

18. »You are Peter Greek: petros: piece of rock, and on this rock-mass Greek: petra: mass of rockreferring to Jesus I will build my congregation. The entrance to the grave Greek: Hades will not have power to stop it.

19. »I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is improper and unlawful in heaven, and whatever you declare lawful on earth must be lawful in heaven.«

20. He gave orders to the disciples to tell no man he was the Christ.

21. From that time forward Jesus made it clear to his disciples how he would have to go to Jerusalem. He told them he would undergo much at the hands of the authorities, including the chief priests and scribes. He let them know he would be put to death. The third day he would come back from the dead.

22. Peter protested and rebuked Jesus. He said: »Do not think of that, Lord; it will never happen to you.«

23. He turned to Peter and said: »Get behind me, Satan. You are a stumbling block to me. You think the things of men, not of God.«

24. Then Jesus told his disciples: »If any man wants to follow me be mine, let him deny disown himself, and take up his stake and follow me Greek: akoloutheo moi, let him be following meaccompany mebe in the same way with me.

25. »He who wants to save his life will lose it. He who is willing to lose his life for my sake will find it.

26. »What will a man profit, if he gains the whole world, and gives up his life? What will a man give in exchange for his life?

27. »The Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels. He will then reward each man according to his deeds.

28. »I tell you truly, there are some that stand here who will not experience death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.«

## Matthew 17

1. After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother up into a high mountain alone.

2. While they watched, Jesus appearance changed transformedtransfigured in their presence. His face was as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.

3. Moses and Elijah appeared, and they were talking to him.

4. Peter told Jesus: »Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«

5. While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud, saying: »This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.«

6. When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces. They were very afraid.

7. Jesus touched them and told them to get up and not be afraid.

8. They saw only Jesus when they opened their eyes.

9. When they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone what they saw, until the Son of man has risen from the dead.

10. His disciples asked him: »Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«

11. In answer he said: »Elijah truly has to come and put all things right.

12. »I tell you that Elijah has come. They did not know him and treated him badly as they pleased. They will do the same with the Son of man.«

13. Then the disciples saw that he was telling them about John the Baptist.

14. When they approached the people, a man fell to his knees before him, saying:

15. »Lord, have mercy on my son. He has mental problems and is in great pain. He frequently falls into the fire and into the water.

16. »I took him to your disciples, and they were not able to make him well.«

17. Jesus answered: »You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.«

18. Jesus ordered the unclean spirit to leave the boy. It left him and the boy was made well immediately.

19. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: »Why were we not able to send it out?«

20. He told them: »It was because of your lack of faith: Truly I say to you, if you have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move and it will move. Nothing will be impossible to you.«

22. While they were traveling in Galilee, Jesus said to them: »The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men.

23. »They will put him to death. The third day he will be raised from death.« They were very sad.

24. They arrived at Capernaum. The collectors of the two-drachma tax asked Peter: »Does your master make payment of the Temple tax?

25. He said: »Yes.« When he entered the house, Jesus said to him: »What is your opinion, Simon? Who pays the tax assessed by the kings of the earth? Is it from their sons or from other people?«

26. When he said: »From other people,« Jesus replied: »Are the sons free of tax?

27. »We will not cause them trouble. Go to the sea, and let down a hook, and take the first fish you catch. You will see money a stater coin in its mouth. Give it to them for me and for you.«

## Matthew 18

1. In that hour the disciples came to Jesus. They asked: »Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?«

2. He took a little child and put him in the middle of them.

3. He said: »Truly I tell you, if you do not have a change of heart and become like little children, you will not go into the kingdom of heaven.

4. »He who humbles himself to become like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

5. »Everyone who accepts this little child in my name accepts me.

6. »He who causes one of my faithful little ones to stumble is in trouble. It would be better for him to end up in the deep sea with a great stone tied to his neck.

7. »A curse is on the earth because of stumbling! It is necessary for stumbling to come. Unhappy is that man through whom the stumbling comes.

8. »If your hand or your foot is a cause of stumbling cut it off. Get rid of it. It is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than, having two hands or two feet, to be destroyed by eternal fire.

9. »If your eye causes you stumbling, take it out and throw it away. It is better for you to go into life with one eye than, having two eyes, to be destroyed in ever-burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom Greek: Gehenna.

10. »Do not treat these little ones badly. I tell you that angels represent them in the presence of my Father in heaven.

11. omitted, text not found in early manuscripts

12. »What do you think? A man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone wandering away. Will he leave the ninety-nine and go in search of the wandering one?

13. »When he finds it, I tell you he will be filled with more joy than he would have if he had stayed with the ninety-nine.

14. »Even so, your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost.

15. »If your brother does wrong to you, go to him in private. Clearly explain his error between you and him. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother back.

16. »If he does not listen to you, take one or two more people with you. Two or three witnesses may prove every case.

17. »If he will not listen to them, let it come to the attention of the congregation. If he will not listen to the congregation, let him be to you as a heathen and a tax collector.

18. »I tell you; whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be declared improper and unlawful in heaven. Whatever you make free on earth will be declared lawful in heaven.

19. »Again, I say to you, that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.

20. »Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.«

21. Peter came to him and said: »Lord, How many times may my brother do wrong against me, and I forgive him? Seven times?«

22. Jesus said to him: »Not seven times; but seventy times seven.

23. »The kingdom of heaven is like a king who went over his accounts with his servants.

24. »First, one came to him who owed him ten thousand talents.

25. »He was not able to make payment. So his lord gave orders for him to be sold. His wife, sons, and daughters were all to be sold along with every possession. The money would be used for payment of what he owed.

26. »So the servant fell on his face out of respect. He said: Lord, give me time to make payment and I will pay everything.

27. »Being moved with pity, the lord let him go, and made him free of the debt.

28. »Then that servant met another servant who was in debt to him for one hundred denarii. He took him by the throat, saying, Pay your debt now.

29. »That servant fell down before him, saying, Give me time and I will make payment to you.

30. »He would not give him time. He put him into prison till he paid the debt.

31. »When the other servants saw what happened, they were very sad. They told their lord what had been done.

32. »His lord sent for him, and said: Evil servant; I made you free of all that debt, because of your request to me.

33. »Should you also show mercy to your fellow servant the same way I showed mercy to you?

34. »His lord was angry and sent him to jail to be punished until he paid back all of his debt.

35. »My heavenly Father will treat you like that if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.«

## Matthew 19

1. When Jesus finished speaking, he departed from Galilee. He went to the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.

2. Large crowds followed him, and he healed many of them.

3. Pharisees came to him. They tested him, asking: »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?«

4. He answered: »Have you not read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female?

5. »For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two shall become one flesh.

6. »So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What God has joined together, let no man pull apart separate!«

7. They asked him: »Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, to send her away?«

8. He answered: »Moses allowed you to send your wives away because of your hardness of heart. It was not allowed from the beginning.

9. »I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. And he who marries her when she is divorced, commits adultery.«

10. The disciples said to him: »This being the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.«

11. He said: »This does not apply to everyone, only to those God has given it to.

12. »For there are men who, from birth, were without sex. There are some who were made that way by men. There are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this let him accept it.«

13. Then some people brought little children to him. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and bless them. But the disciples tried to stop them.

14. Jesus said: »Let the little ones children come to me. Do not keep them away: for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.«

15. He put his hands on them, and then went on his way.

16. One man said: »Master, what good thing must I do, so that I may have eternal life?«

17. Jesus answered him: »Why are you questioning me about what is good? There is one who is good. If you desire life, obey the Law.«

18. The man replied: »Which law?« And Jesus said: »Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false witness,

19. »Honor your father and your mother, and Love your neighbor as yourself.«

20. The man said to him: »I have done all these things; what more is there?«

21. Jesus then replied: »If you wish to be complete, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor. You will have wealth in heaven. Then follow me!«

22. But hearing these words, the young man went away grieving, for he was very wealthy.

23. Jesus said to his disciples: »Truly I tell you, it is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven.

24. »Again I say, It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God.«

25. The disciples were greatly surprised when they heard this. »Who, then, may have salvation?« they asked.

26. Jesus looked at them and said: »With men this is not possible. All things are possible with God!«

27. Then Peter said: »See, we have given up everything to follow you. What then will we have?«

28. Jesus replied: »Truly I say to you, when all things are made new, and the Son of man is seated in his glory, you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. »Everyone who has given up houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or child, or land, for my name, will receive many times as much, and have everlasting life.

30. »Many who are first will be last. Some who are last will be first.«

## Matthew 20

1. »The kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.

2. »He made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day. Then he sent them into his vineyard.

3. »He went out the third hour and saw others in the marketplace doing nothing.«

4. »He said to them: Go to the vineyard with the others. I will pay you whatever is right. So they went to work.

5. »He went out the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same.

6. »The eleventh hour, he saw others doing nothing. He asked: Why are you here all the day doing nothing?

7. »They said: No man has given us work. He told them to go work with the rest in the vineyard.

8. »When evening came, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager: Let the workers come and pay them from the last to the first.

9. »Those men who went to work at the eleventh hour were each given a penny.

10. »Those who worked longer, expected to be paid more. They were also given a penny.

11. »When they got it, they protested against the master of the house.

12. »They said: The last ones have done only one hours work. You have made them equal to us. We have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat.

13. »He told them: I do you no wrong. You made an agreement with me for a penny.

14. »Take what is yours and leave. I wish to give to the last workers the same as to you.

15. »Is it lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye jealous because I am generous?

16. »So the last will be first, and the first last.«

17. When Jesus went to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and talked to them.

18. »When we get to Jerusalem,« he said, »The Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes. They will give orders for him to be put to death.

19. »They will turn him over to the heathen to be made sport of and to be whipped. He will be put to death on the stake. The third day he will come back from the dead.«

20. The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons. She bowed down and requested a favor of him.

21. »What is your desire?« he asked. She said to him: »Let my two sons be seated, the one at your right hand, and the other at your left, in your kingdom.«

22. Jesus told her: »You have no idea what you are requesting. Are you able to take of the cup I am about to take? »

23. They said: »We are able.« »Truly, you will take of my cup,« he said. »But to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.«

24. When the ten heard it, they were angry with the two brothers.

25. Jesus called them to himself and said: »You know that the rulers of the nations exercise absolute dominion over them. They lord it over them and behave like tyrants.

26. »But it will not be so among you. He who will be great among you must be your servant.

27. And he who will be first among you will be your attendant servantminister.

28. »The Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom in payment for many.«

29. A great crowd followed him when they departed from Jericho.

30. Two blind men sitting by the side of the road heard Jesus pass by and cried out: »Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!«

31. The crowd told them to be quiet. But they cried even more, saying: »Have mercy on us, O Lord, you Son of David!«

32. Jesus stood still and asked them: »What do you want me to do to you?«

33. They said: »Lord give us our sight.«

34. Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Now they could see! So they followed him.

## Matthew 21

1. They were near Jerusalem at Bethphage. Jesus sent two disciples to the Mount of Olives.

2. He told them, »Go to the nearby town and look for a donkey with a cord around her neck. There will be a young one with her. Turn them loose and bring them to me.

3. »Tell anyone who asks, The Lord needs them, and right away he will allow them to go.«

4. This took place so that the words of the prophet might come true:

5. »Say to the daughter of Zion, See, your King comes to you, humble, and seated on a donkey, a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.«

6. So the disciples did as Jesus commanded.

7. They got the donkey and the young one, and laid their clothing on them. And he sat on the clothing.

8. Most of the people spread their garments on the road. Others took branches from the trees and put them on the road.

9. Those going ahead of him and following him shouted praise: »Glory to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah! Glory in the highest!« (Psalms 118:26)

10. When he came to Jerusalem, the people were excited. They asked: »Who is this?«

11. Other people said: »This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.«

12. Jesus went into the Temple and drove out all who were trading there. He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those trading in doves.

13. He told them: »It is written, My house is to be named a house of prayer, but you are making it a hiding place of thieves.«

14. The blind and the crippled came to him in the Temple, and he made them well.

15. The chief priests and the scribes saw the powerful works he did. They heard the children crying out in the Temple: »Glory to the son of David.« This made them very angry.

16. »Have you any idea what these people are saying?« Jesus answered: »Yes. It is written, From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete.«

17. He left them and went out of the town to Bethany where he stayed for the night.

18. He was hungry in the morning when he returned to the town.

19. He saw a fig tree along the side of the road. He went to it and saw nothing on it but leaves. He told it: »You will not bare fruit from this time forward, forever.« Immediately the fig tree became dry and dead.

20. The disciples were surprised when they saw it. They asked how the fig tree became dry so quickly?

21. Jesus answered: »If you have faith and do not doubt, I make this promise to you: You will be able to do what was done to this fig tree. When you say to this mountain, be moved into the sea, it will be done.

22. »You will receive the things you ask for in prayer when you have faith.«

23. When he went into the Temple, the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching. They asked: »By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?«

24. Jesus answered: »I will ask you one question. If you give me the answer, I will say by what authority I do these things.

25. »Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven or from men?« They talked among themselves. »If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did you not have faith in him?

26. »But if we say, From men, we must fear the people, because they all recognize John to be a prophet.«

27. Therefore they answered: »We have no idea.« He replied to them: »Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things.«

28. »What do you think? A man had two sons. He asked the first to work today in the vineyard.

29. »The first son said in answer, I will not. Later he changed his mind and went to work.

30. »He said the same to the second son. That son answered, Yes, I will go, but he did not go to work.

31. »Which of the two pleased his father?« They replied: »The first.« Jesus said to them: »I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will go into the kingdom of God before you.«

32. »John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him. Even the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. When you saw this, you did not regret your sins and did not have faith in him.

33. »Listen to another illustration. A master of a house made a vineyard, and put a wall around it. He made a wine press and built a tower. Then he rented it to workers and traveled to another country.

34. »When the time for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the workmen, to get the fruit.

35. »The workmen attacked his servants, striking one with a stone and killing the other.

36. »He sent other servants more in number than the first. They did the same to them.

37. »Finally he sent his son to them, saying, Certainly they will respect my son.

38. »When the workmen saw the son, they said, Let us put him to death and take his heritage, for someday he will own this property.

39. »They took him out of the vineyard and killed him.

40. »When the lord of the vineyard returns, what will he do to the workmen?«

41. They all said: »He will put those cruel men to death. Then he will find other workmen who are worthy and who will give him fruit when it is ready.«

42. Jesus said to them: »Have you read the Scriptures, The stone the builders rejected has been made the chief cornerstone of the building. This was Jehovahs doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes. (Isaiah 28:16)

43. »For this reason I tell you, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you. It will be given to a nation producing fruit.

44. »Any man falling on this stone will be broken. Any man having this stone fall on him will be crushed to dust.«

45. When the chief priests and Pharisees heard his illustrations they realized he was talking about them.

46. They wanted to seize him, but feared the people, because the people saw Jesus as a prophet.

## Matthew 22

1. Jesus continued to speak to them with illustrations.

2. »The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.

3. »He sent out his servants to invite guests to the feast, but they would not come.

4. »Again he sent out other servants with orders to say to the guests, I have prepared my feast. Oxen and fat livestock are butchered and everything is ready, so come to the feast.

5. »But they paid no attention and went about their business. One went to his farm and another went to his trade.

6. »The rest violently attacked his servants and put them to death.

7. »The king was angry, and sent his armies to put the evil servants to death and to destroy their town with fire.

8. »He said to his servants, The feast is ready, but the guests were not worthy.

9. »Go then, to the main roads, and invite all those whom you see to come to the feast.

10. »They went to the roads and brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike. And the banquet room was filled with guests.

11. »When the king met the guests he found that one of them was not wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding.

12. »The king asked why did he not wear proper clothes for the wedding? But the guest had no excuse.

13. »The king gave orders for that person to be tied hand and foot and thrown outside into the dark. That is where people will cry and grind their teeth in pain.

14. »Many are called, but few chosen.«

15. The Pharisees took counsel how they might trap him in his talk.

16. They sent their disciples with the Herodians to Jesus. They said: »Teacher we know you are truthful. You teach the way of God in truth. And you are not partial to the influence of men.

17. »Tell us what you think? Is it lawful to pay the poll tax to Caesar, or not?«

18. Jesus perceived their wickedness. He said: »Why do you test me, you hypocrites?

19. »Show me the tribute money.« They brought a penny denarius to him.

20. He asked: »Whose image and superscription is on this coin?«

21. »Caesars,« they said. Then he said: »Pay Caesar the things that are Caesars. Pay God the things that are Gods.«

22. When they heard it, they were amazed and left him.

23. That same day, Sadducees came to him. They believe there is no resurrection. They asked him a question.

24. »Teacher, Moses said if a man dies having no children, his brother should marry his wife, and bring up seed for his brother.

25. »There were seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no children, left his wife to his brother.

26. »The same happened to the second, right on through the seventh.

27. »After that the woman died.

28. »In the resurrection, with which of the seven will she be married? All seven had her.«

29. Jesus answered: »You are mistaken! You do not know the scriptures or the power of God.

30. »In the resurrection they will not marry nor be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.

31. »Concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you read that which was spoken to you by God?

32. »God said: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living!«

33. When many people heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.

34. The Pharisees assembled together when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence.

35. One of them, a lawyer, tested him by asking a question.

36. »Teacher what is the greatest commandment in the law?«

37. Jesus told him: »You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart Greek: kardia: feelings, emotions, and with all your being, and with your entire mind Greek: dianoia: understanding. (Deuteronomy 6:5)

38. »This is the greatest and first commandment.

39. »The second like it is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

40. »The law and the prophets are based on these two commandments.«

41. The Pharisees were gathered together, so Jesus asked them a question.

42. »What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?« They said: »The son of David.«

43. He said: »How then does David, directed by Spirit, call him Lord, saying,

44. »Jehovah said to my Lord, »Sit on my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet.«  (Psalm 110:1)

45. »If David called him Lord, how is he his son?«

46. No one was able to answer him. After that they asked no more questions.

## Matthew 23

## Matthew 25

1. »The kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.

8. »All the foolish virgins said to the wise: Give us your oil, for our lamps are going out.

9. »But the wise answered: There will not be enough for both of us. Go to the dealers and buy oil for yourself.

10. »While they were away, the bridegroom came. They that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut.

11. »Later the other virgins came, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.

12. »But he told them: I do not know you.

13. »Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour.

14. »It is like a man going to another country. He called his servants and put them in charge of his property.

15. »To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one. He assigned according to the servants ability. Then he went on his journey.

16. »Right away the servant who received the five talents traded with them and made another five talents.

17. »In like manner, he who received the two gained another two.

18. »He who received the one dug a hole in the ground and hid his lords money.

19. »After a long time the lord of those servants came back to settle with them.

20. »The servant who received five talents brought another five talents. He said: Lord, here are your five talents, plus the five I gained.

21. »His lord said: Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, so I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.

22. »The one who received two talents said: Lord you gave me two talents and I gained another two talents.

23. »His lord said: Well done, good and faithful servant. You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.

24. »The servant who received one talent said: Lord, I knew you to be a hard man. You reap where you did not sow and gather where you did not scatter.

25. »I was afraid, so I hid your talent in the earth. See, you have what is yours.

26. »But his lord answered: You wicked and lazy servant. You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter.

27. »You should have put my money in the bank. I should have received my money back plus interest.

28. »Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.

31. »When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.

32. »All nations will be gathered before him. He will then separate them one from another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

33. »He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

34. »The King will say to those on his right hand: Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

35. »I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you took me in.

36. »I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.

37. »The righteous will answer him: Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?

38. »When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and dress you?

39. »When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?

40. »The King will answer: To the extent that you did it to one of the least of my brothers, you did it to me.

41. »Then he will tell those on his left: Depart from me, you cursed, into the ever-burning fire that is prepared for the Devil and his fallen angels.

42. »I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.

43. »I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not dress me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.

44. »They will also ask: Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison and not minister to you?

45. »The King will answer: To the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of my brothers, you did not do it to me.

46. »These will go away into ever-burning fire everlasting cutting offdeathtotal destructiondoompunishmenteverlasting penalty, but the righteous to everlasting life.«

## Matthew 26

1. When Jesus had finished talking, he said to his disciples:

2. »As you know, the Passover will be here in two days. At that time the Son of man will be captured and impaled.«

3. The chief priest and the elders of the people assembled at the court of Caiaphas, the high priest.

4. All of them, using deceit, worked together to capture Jesus and kill him.

5. They insisted: »Not during the feast; it could start a riot among the people.«

6. Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper.

7. A woman came to him having an alabaster vase containing very precious ointment. She poured it upon his head while he was eating.

8. The disciples saw it and were indignant. »To what purpose is this waste?

9. »This ointment could have been sold for much and the money given to the poor.«

10. Jesus was aware of this and said: »Why do you trouble the woman? Her expression to me was good.

11. »The poor are always with you, but I am not always with you.

12. »She poured this ointment on my body to prepare me for burial.

13. »I tell you, Everywhere this good news is preached in the entire world, this good deed done by this woman will be spoken of in memory of her.«

14. Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests.

15. He asked them: »What are you willing to give me to deliver him to you?« They paid him thirty pieces of silver.

16. He continued to seek opportunity to turn him over to them.

17. The first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus. They asked: »Where do you wish to eat the Passover?«

18. Jesus told them to go into the city and tell a certain man: »The Teachers time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.«

19. The disciples did as Jesus told them, to get ready for the Passover.

20. When evening arrived, he sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.

21. While they ate, he said: »One of you will betray me.«

22. They were filled with sorrow, and each one asked him: »Is it I, Lord?«

23. He answered: »He who dips his hand with me in the dish is the same one who will betray me.

24. »It is written that the Son of man will depart. The man who betrays him will experience much grief. It would have been better if that man had not been born.«

25. Judas, the man who betrayed him, asked: »Is it I, Rabbi?« Jesus replied: »You said it.«

26. As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed, and broke it; and he gave to the disciples. Then he said: »Take, eat; this is representsmeansexemplifies my body.«

27. Then he took a cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: »Drink it all.«

28. »This is representsmeansexemplifies my blood of the covenant, poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.

29. »I tell you, I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«

30. After they sang a song of praise to God, they went to the Mount of Olives.

31. Jesus said to them: »All of you will fall away because of me tonight. It is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.

32. »When I am raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.«

33. Peter answered: »Even if everyone falls away because of you, I will never fall away.«

34. Jesus said: »I say to you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.«

35. Peter protested: »Even if I must die for you, I would not deny you!« His disciples said the same thing.

36. Jesus went with them to Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«

37. He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. He was sorrowful and very troubled.

38. He told them: »My heart is deeply grieved to the point of death. Stay with me and watch.«

39. Then he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed: »My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«

40. When he came to the disciples, they were sleeping. He said to Peter: »Could you not watch with me one hour?

41. »Watch and pray continually that you do not enter into temptation!«

42. A second time he went away and prayed, saying: »Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be done.«

43. He returned to find them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.

44. He went away to pray a third time, saying the same words.

45. After returning to the disciples, he said: »Do you sleep now and take your rest? The hour is here and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

46. »Arise, let us go; the man who betrays me is here.«

47. As he spoke, Judas, one of the twelve, followed by a crowd carrying swords and spears, approached him. The chief priest and elders of the people had sent them.

48. He that betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them: »The one I kiss is he. Take him.«

49. He went directly to Jesus and said: »Hail, Rabbi,« and kissed him.

50. Jesus told him: »Do that for which you came.« They laid hands on Jesus, and captured him.

51. Look, one of them with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest.

52. Jesus told him: »Put your sword in its place. Those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

53. »Do you think I cannot ask my Father for help? He would send me more than twelve legions of angels.

54. »How then will the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?«

55. That very hour Jesus said to the people, »Have you come out to take me with swords and sticks as if I were a thief? You did not take me when I taught in the Temple daily.

56. »This has taken place so that the writings of the prophets will come true.« Then all his disciples left him.

57. Those who captured Jesus took him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and those in authority also gathered there.

58. But Peter kept his distance. He followed him to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the servants, to see the outcome.

59. The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death.

60. They failed, even though a number of false witnesses came.

61. Later two witnesses came. They said: »This man said, I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.«

62. The high priest stood up and said to him: »Have you no answer? What is it these say against you?«

63. Jesus said nothing. The high priest said to him: »I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«

64. Jesus said to him: »You said it yourself. And I say to you, after this you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.«

65. Then the high priest ripped his robes apart and said: »He has said evil against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard his words of blasphemy!«

66. »What is your opinion?« The crowd answered: »Put him to death!«

67. They spat in his face and hit him, saying:

68. »Prophesy to us, you Christ; tell us who hit you!«

69. Peter was seated in the square outside the house, and a servant-girl came to him. She said: »You were with Jesus the Galilean.«

70. In front of everybody, he replied: »I do not know what you are talking about.«

71. When he reached the gate, another saw him and said: »This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.«

72. Again he denied with an oath: »I have no knowledge of the man.«

73. A few moments later, those who were near approached and said to Peter: »Indeed, you are one of them, because the way you speak gives you away.«

74. Then with curses and oaths he said: »I do not know the man!« And immediately a rooster crowed.

75. Peter remembered what Jesus told him: »Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.« He went out and wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. It was morning. The chief priests and those in authority conspired to put Jesus to death.

2. They tied his hands with cords and led him to the ruler, Pilate.

3. Judas, his betrayer, heard he was to be put to death. Out of regret, he took the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and those in authority.

4. He said: »I have done wrong in giving a righteous man to you.«

5. He left the silver in the Temple. Then he went away and hanged himself.

6. The chief priests took the silver. They said: »It is not right to put it in the Temple treasury, for it is the price of blood.«

7. They decided to use the silver to buy the potters field. This would be a place to bury strangers.

8. This is the reason the field was named »Field of Blood.«

9. Then Jeremiahs prophecy was fulfilled: »They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price he was valued by the children of Israel.

10. »Then they paid for the potters field, just as God directed.«

11. Jesus stood before the governor. He asked him: »Are you the King of the Jews?« Jesus said to him: »It is as you say.«

12. When the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.

13. Pilate said to him: »Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?«

14. Jesus did not answer. Not even a word! The governor was greatly surprised.

15. It was a custom for the governor to set one prisoner free at the time of the feast. The people were to help choose that prisoner.

16. At that time they held an important prisoner named Barabbas.

17. When they assembled, Pilate asked: »What is your choice? Barabbas or Jesus, the one called the Christ?«

18. He knew it was because of envy they gave him up.

19. While he was seated in judgment his wife sent a message to him. She said, »Do not judge that righteous man. I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him.«

20. The chief priests and elders got the people to request Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.

21. The governor responded to them. He asked: »Which of the two do you want me to set free?« They shouted: »Barabbas!«

22. Pilate said to them: »What am I to do with Jesus, the one called Christ?« They all said: »Put him to death. Impale him!«

23. »What evil has he done?« Pilate asked. But they shouted: »Impale him!«

24. Pilate saw that he could do nothing. The people were ready to cause much trouble. He took water and washed his hands in front of the people. He said: »The blood of this man is not on my hands. You are responsible.«

25. The people answered: »Let his blood be on us, and on our children.«

26. He set Barabbas free. He had Jesus whipped. Then he commanded that he be put to death on the stake.

27. Then the palace guard took Jesus into the open square and gathered their squad together.

28. They took off his clothes and dressed him in a scarlet robe.

29. They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They placed a rod in his right hand. Then they bowed down on their knees before him. They mocked him, saying: »Long life to the King of the Jews.«

30. They spat on him and hit him on the head with the rod.

31. After they mocked him, they took off the robe. He was dressed in his garments and he was led away to be impaled.

32. They then found Simon, a man from Cyrene. They forced him to go with them to carry the stake.

33. Golgotha, the Place of the Skull, was to be his final destination.

34. They gave him vinegar bitter wine to drink mixed with poison a druggall. When he tasted it he would not drink. (Psalm 69:21)

35. When they impaled him, they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots.

36. Then they sat and watched him.

37. A sign was placed above his head with an accusation written: »This is Jesus the King of the Jews.«

38. Two robbers were impaled with him. One was on the right hand and one on the left.

39. People passing by spoke evil abuse to him. They wagged their heads

40. and said, »You who would destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God come down from the stake.«

41. In like manner the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked him.

42. They said: »He saved others, but cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the stake and we will believe in him.«

43. He trusts in God. Let him save him now if he wants him. After all he said: »I am the Son of God.«

44. The robbers that were impaled with him also insulted him.

45. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

46. About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« Which translated means: »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«

47. After hearing it some said this man calls Elijah.

48. Suddenly, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.

49. The rest said: »Let it be, and see whether Elijah comes to save him.«

50. Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.

51. The veil curtain of the temple was ripped in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks split.

52. The tombs were split open and many dead bodies were tossed upright on the ground.

53. They came out of the tombs after his resurrection.Manuscript text unclear. Many people saw them.

54. The centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake. Filled with much fear of the things that were done, they proclaimed: »Truly, this was the Son of God!«

55. The women who followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to him watched from a distance.

56. Included among the women were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

57. A disciple of Jesus named Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea,

58. went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate commanded that it be given to him.

59. Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.

60. He laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb, and departed.

61. Mary Magdalene was near the tomb. The other Mary was also there.

62. It was morning, the day after Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate.

63. They said: »Sir, we remember while he was yet alive, the deceiver said, After three days I will rise again.«

64. »Command the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise his disciples could come and steal him away. They could say to the people. He is risen from the dead. The last deception will be worse than the first.«

65. Pilate said to them: »You have a guard; make it as secure as you can.«

66. So they made the tomb secure. They sealed the stone and placed a guard there.

## Matthew 28

1. Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.

2. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, as an angel of God descended from heaven and rolled away the stone and sat on it.

3. His appearance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.

4. The guards shook with fear and became as dead men.

5. The angel spoke to the women: »I know you seek Jesus who has been impaled; do not fear.

6. »He is not here, for he has risen just as he promised. Come; see the place where the Lord lay.

7. »Go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead. See, he goes before you to Galilee. You will see him there, as I have told you.«

8. They departed quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy. They ran to bring his disciples the news.

9. Jesus met them and greeted them. They approached and took hold of his feet and kissed them in adoration.

10. Then Jesus told them: »Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to travel to Galilee. I will see them there.«

11. While they were going, some of the guard came into the city. They told the chief priests all the things that happened.

12. They took counsel with the elders. Then they bribed the soldiers.

13. The soldiers were instructed to say: »His disciples came at night and stole him while we slept.«

14. »If the governor hears about this, we will persuade him so you may be free from worry.«

15. So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.

16. The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus specified.

17. When they saw him, they bowed down in adoration for him. But some doubted were lacking faith.

18. Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying: »All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.

19. »Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

20. »Teach them to observe all the things I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.«
