# Mark

## Mark 1

__(Writer: John Mark) (Hebrew Name: John, means Jehovah has shown favor) (60-65 C.E.) (Rome)__

1. The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

2. The prophet Isaiah wrote: »I am sending my messenger ahead of you to prepare your way.«

3. »The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of Jehovah, make his paths straight.« (Isaiah 40:3)

4. John the Baptist was in the desert wilderness telling people to repent turn away from sin and be baptized for forgiveness of sins.

5. People from the province of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to hear John. They confessed their sins and he baptized them in the Jordan River.

6. John was clothed in camels hair with a leather belt about his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.

7. He told the people: »The man who comes after me is greater than I am. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his shoes.

8. »I baptized immersed you with water, but he will baptize Greek: baptizo: immerse, submerge you with Holy Spirit.«

9. Soon Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee. John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.

10. When Jesus came out of the water he saw the heavens open and the Spirit descended on him like a dove.

11. Then a voice came from heaven: « You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.«

12. At once the Spirit compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness filled with wild animals.

13. Satan tempted Jesus. This lasted forty days. The angels took care of Jesus.

14. After John was locked in prison Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News of God to the people.

15. Jesus said: »The time has come. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news.«

16. Walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two fishermen Simon and Andrew, Simons brother. They were casting a net into the sea.

17. Jesus said: Follow me and I will teach you to catch people.

18. They immediately left the nets and went with him.

19. Jesus then saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat preparing their nets to go fishing.

20. Jesus called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with Jesus.

21. Jesus and his followers traveled to Capernaum. On the day of worship Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.

22. They were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught with authority and not like the scribes.

23. Suddenly in the synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit. He screamed:

24. »What do you want with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!«

25. Jesus rebuked the spirit by saying: »Be quiet, and come out of him!«

26. The evil spirit shook the man hard, gave a loud scream, and came out of him.

27. The people were all amazed and questioned. »What is this? What new doctrine is this? He has authority over the unclean spirits, and they obey him.«

28. His fame spread to the entire country of Galilee.

29. Jesus and his disciples, including James and John, left the synagogue and went directly to the home of Simon and Andrew.

30. Simons mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. At once they told Jesus about her.

31. He took her by the hand and helped her sit up. The fever suddenly left. So she got up and prepared a meal for them.

32. That evening at sunset many sick and demon-possessed people were presented to Jesus.

33. A huge crowd of people from all over Capernaum gathered outside to watch.

34. Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. He cast out many demons. Knowing them he would not permit the demons to speak.

35. Early in the morning, long before daybreak, Jesus awoke and went into the wilderness to pray.

36. Later Simon and the others went out to find him.

37. They informed him: »Everyone is asking for you.«

38. He replied: »We must go to other towns. I will preach to them too. I came for this purpose.«

39. He went to Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits.

40. A man with leprosy knelt in front of Jesus and begged to be healed. »If you want to, you can make me well,« he said.

41. Moved with compassion Jesus touched him. »I want to,« he said. »Be healed!«

42. Instantly the leprosy disappeared and man was healed.

43. Jesus sent him away and warned him. »Go directly to the priest and let him examine you.

44. »Do not talk to anyone along the way. Take the offering the Law of Moses requires for those healed of leprosy. That way everyone will have proof of your healing.«

45. But the man gave a public account of his healing everywhere he went. Soon crowds surrounded Jesus and he could not enter a town publicly. He had to stay in secluded places and people continued to come to him.

## Mark 2

1. Several days later Jesus returned to Capernaum. The word spread that he was home.

2. So many people gathered that there was no room left even by the door. Jesus was speaking Gods word to them.

3. Men came to him carrying a paralyzed man.

4. They could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they removed the roof over the place where Jesus was. Then they lowered the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.

5. When Jesus saw their faith, he told the man: »Friend your sins are forgiven.«

6. Some of the scribes sitting there reasoned in their hearts:

7. »Why does this man speak this way? He blasphemes for only God is the one who can forgive sins.«

8. Jesus immediately discerned in his spirit that they reasoned within themselves. He asked them: »Why reason these things in your hearts?

9. »Which is easier to say to the sick man your sins are forgiven or take your bed and walk?

10. »So you may see that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth,« he said to the man:

11. »Get up and take your bed, and go to your house.«

12. He got up, took the bed and went out before them all. They were all filled with wonder. They gave glory to God and said we have never seen anything like this.

13. Again he went to the seaside and all the people followed him. So he taught them.

14. He saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, seated at the place where taxes were collected. He said to him: »Come with me.« And he got up and went with him.

15. He was reclining at the meal in his house. Several tax collectors and sinners were at the table with Jesus and his disciples. There were a great number of them, and they came after him.

16. When the scribes of the Pharisees saw he was eating with the tax collectors and sinners they asked his disciples: »Why does he take food and drink with such men?«

17. Jesus heard this. He said to them: »Those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill do. I have come to care for sinners not the upright.«

18. Johns disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came to him and asked: »Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not?«

19. Jesus replied: »Will the friends of a newly married man practice fasting while he is with them? As long as they have him with them they will not go without food.

20. »But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.

21. »No man puts a patch of new cloth on an old coat. The new, by pulling away from the old, makes a worse hole.

22. »No man puts new wine into old wineskins. The skins will burst and the wine and the skins will be wasted. New wine has to be put into new wine skins.«

23. Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath day. While they walked his disciples took the heads of grain.

24. The Pharisees said: »Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?«

25. He said: »Do you not know of what David did when he needed food for himself and his companions?

26. »He went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest. David took the holy bread for food and gave to his companions. Only the priests may take the holy bread.

27. »The Sabbath was made for man, said Jesus, and not man for the Sabbath.

28. »The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.«

## Mark 3

1. He entered the Synagogue again. There was a man there whose hand was withered.

2. They watched to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath day. Then they might have something against him.

3. He said to the man: »Get up and come forward.«

4. Then he asked the Pharisees, »Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? Is it right to give life or to put to death?« But they said nothing.

5. He looked at them and was angry. He was also sad on account of their hard hearts. He said to the man: »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out and his hand was healed.

6. The Pharisees went away and immediately conspired with the Herodians. They tried to decide how they might destroy him.

7. Jesus went with his disciples to the sea. A great crowed from Galilee followed. They were also from Judaea,

8. Jerusalem, Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and from Tyre and Sidon. These people heard the great things he did and came to him.

9. He asked his disciples to have a small boat ready because the crowd might press too close to him.

10. He healed many. Others with afflictions pressed close to him that they might touch him.

11. The unclean spirits fell down before him and cried: You are the Son of God.

12. He commanded them not to make him known.

13. He went up on the mountain and invited anyone who wanted to go with him.

14. He appointed twelve to be with him and he sent them out to preach.

15. He gave them authority to cast out demons.

16. The twelve included Simon whom he surnamed Peter,

17. James the son of Zebedee, John the brother of James surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:

18. Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananaean.

19. Also present was Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Then he went into a house.

20. The crowd gathered so close that they did not have time for bread.

21. When his own people heard of this they went to apprehend him. They said: »He has lost his senses.«

22. Scribes that came down from Jerusalem said: »He has Beelzebub. He casts out demons by the prince of the demons.«

23. Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in illustrations. He asked: »How could Satan cast out Satan?

24. »When a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand.

25. »When a house is divided against itself it will not be able to stand.

26. »If Satan has risen up against himself, he is divided, cannot stand and will come to an end.

27. »No one can enter into the house of the strong man and steal his property unless he first captures the strong man. Then he will steal his property.

28. »I tell you sins will be forgiven of the sons of men, and their evil talk will be forgiven.

29. »But whoever speaks evil and defames Holy Spirit will not be forgiven but is guilty of an eternal sin.«

30. They exclaimed: »He has an unclean spirit!«

31. His mother and his brother were standing nearby. They sent for him.

32. A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him: »Look your mother and you brother are outside looking for you.«

33. He answered them: »Who is my mother and who is my brother?«

34. Looking at the people who sat around him he said: »Behold, my mother and my brother!

35. »For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.«

## Mark 4

1. Again he taught a very great crowd by the seaside. He sat in a boat while the crowd was on the land.

2. He taught them many things by illustrations and said to them:

3. »Listen, the sower went out to sow.

4. »As he sowed some seed fell by the road and the birds came and devoured it.

5. »Other seed fell on the rocky ground and did not have good soil. Immediately it sprang up, because it had no good soil

6. it became scorched when the sun came up. Then it withered because it had no root.

7. »Some seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked it so it could yield no fruit.

8. »Others fell on good ground and yielded fruit. It grew up, increased and produced thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold.«

9. He continued: »He who has ears to hear let him hear.«

10. When he was alone his followers including the twelve asked about the illustrations.

11. He told them: »The secret of the kingdom of God is given to you. Illustrations are spoken to outsiders.

12. »So that seeing they may see and not perceive. And hearing they may hear and not understand. Otherwise they might repent and be forgiven.«

13. Then he asked: »Do you not understand this illustration? How will you understand any of the illustrations?

14. »The sower sows the word.

15. »These are they by the wayside where the word is sown. When they have heard; Satan comes and takes away the word that has been sown in them.

16. »The same is so of the word sown upon the rocky places. When they have heard the word and receive it with joy,

17. they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while. They stumble when tribulation or persecution arise.

18. »There is the word sown among the thorns. These have heard the word,

19. but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things enter in and choke the word. So it becomes unfruitful.

20. »Those who represent that sown upon the good soil hear the word and accept it. They bear fruit, thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold.«

21. He asked them: »Is the lamp placed under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on the stand?

22. »There is nothing hidden unless it should be made known. Nothing is made secret that should come to light.

23. »If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.«

24. Then he said: »Be careful what you listen to. That which is portioned out by you might be portioned to you and more.

25. »He who has, to him it will be given. He who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has.«

26. He added: »The kingdom of God is like this. A man plants seed in the earth.

27. »He sleeps and gets up night and day until the plants grow though he has no idea how.

28. »The earth gives fruit by itself. First comes the leaf, then the head, then full grain.

29. »When the grain is ready he immediately sends men to cut it, because the time for cutting has come.«

30. He said: »What illustration should we use to picture the kingdom of God? What story will make it clear?

31. »It is like a grain of mustard seed. When it is planted in the earth it is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.

32. »But when it is planted it grows and becomes taller than all the plants. It grows out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade.«

33. He spoke the word to them with many illustrations as long as they were able to listen.

34. He spoke only with illustrations. However he made all things clear to his disciples in private.

35. When evening arrived Jesus said: Let us go over to the other side.«

36. They took him with them on the boat and left the people. Other boats were with him also.

37. A great windstorm came up and the waves came into the boat.

38. He was in back of the boat sleeping on a cushion. They woke him. They said: »Master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction?«

39. He awoke from sleep and commanded the wind and sea. He commanded the sea to be at peace and rest. And he commanded the wind to go down and there was a great calm.

40. He said: »Why are you full of fear? Do you have no faith?«

41. Their fear was great. They said to themselves: »Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey his orders?«

## Mark 5

1. They traveled to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.

2. Just as he got out of the boat a man with an unclean spirit came to him from the tombs.

3. He was living in the tombs. No man was able to bind him even with a chain.

4. Often he was bound in chains and iron bands but he would break them. No man was strong enough to keep him still.

5. Day and night in the tombs and in the mountains he cried out. He would cut himself with stones.

6. He saw Jesus from far off and quickly approached and bowed down before him.

7. Crying out with a loud voice, he said: »What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the highest God? In Gods name do not torment me!«

8. Jesus commanded: »Come out of the man you unclean spirit!«

9. Then Jesus said: »What is your name?« He answered: »My name is Legion because there are a great number of us.«

10. He earnestly implored him not to send the spirits away out of the country.

11. There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the mountainside.

12. They pleaded with Jesus: »Send us into the pigs!«

13. He let them do it. Then the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea. About two thousand of them died in the sea.

14. Their keepers ran off to the town to tell others what happened. People came to see what had taken place.

15. When they came to Jesus they saw the man who had been demon possessed. He was fully clothed and in full use of his senses. So they were afraid.

16. Those who saw the event gave a full account of what happened to the man, the evil spirits and the pigs.

17. They asked Jesus to leave their country.

18. Entering the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons asked that he might be allowed to travel with him.

19. Jesus told him: »Go to your house and to your friends and tell them about the great things God did for you and how he had mercy on you.«

20. He went away and told others in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him. They all marveled.

21. Again Jesus crossed over in the boat to the other side. A great crowd gathered to him while he was by the sea.

22. Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, saw Jesus and fell at his feet.

23. He pleaded with him saying: »My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her that she will be healed and live.«

24. Jesus went with him. A great crowd followed him and they pressed very close to him.

25. There was a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years.

26. She suffered treatment from many physicians but did not become better. She spent all her money and grew worse.

27. Hearing about Jesus she came though the crowd and touched his garment.

28. She said: »If I touch his garments I shall be made whole.«

29. Immediately the flow of her blood dried up. She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.

30. Suddenly Jesus recognized that power issued from him. He turned to the crowd and asked: »Who touched my garments?«

31. His disciples said to him: »You see all these people around you and you ask who touched me?«

32. He looked around to see the woman who had done this thing.

33. The woman was afraid and trembled. Knowing what happened she fell down before him, and told him the truth.

34. He said: »Daughter your faith has made you whole. Go in peace and be healed of your affliction.«

35. While he yet spoke they came from the ruler of the synagogues house. They said: »Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher.«

36. But Jesus did not listen. He said to the ruler of the synagogue believe and do not fear.

37. He allowed only Peter, James, and John the brother of James to follow him.

38. The house of the ruler of the synagogue was filled with commotion. Many were weeping and wailing.

39. He entered and said: »Why all the commotion and why do you weep. The child is not dead but sleeps.«

40. They laughed him to scorn. He sent them all out of the house. Then he took the father, mother and his companions and went to the child.

41. He took the child by the hand and said to her: »Talitha cumi.« Which means when interpreted, »little girl I say to you arise.«

42. Immediately the twelve-year old girl rose up and walked. And they were promptly amazed with a great amazement.

43. He gave them firm orders not to tell any man about this. Then he commanded that she be given something to eat.

## Mark 6

1. He left there and went to his own country. His disciples followed him.

2. Jesus taught in the synagogue on the Sabbath. Many were astonished when they heard him. They asked: »Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to this man and how did he perform these mighty works by his hands?

3. »Is this the carpenter, the son of Mary, brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« He offended them.

4. Jesus said to them: »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own people and in his own house.«

5. He laid his hands upon a few sick and healed them. Otherwise he did no mighty work there.

6. He wondered at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages teaching.

7. He summoned the twelve and sent them forth in pairs. They were given authority over the unclean spirits.

8. They were instructed to take nothing for their journey, with the exception of a walking staff.

9. They were to take no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse and no extra sandals or coat.

10. He said: »When someone invites you to enter into a house, stay there until you leave.

11. »When someone will not listen to you leave that house and shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to the householder.«

12. They went out to preach that men should repent.

13. They cast out many demons. They anointed the sick with oil and healed them.

14. John the Baptist had become well known. King Herod heard that John had risen from the dead. Therefore he was doing these powerful works.

15. But others said: »It is Elijah.« And others said: »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets.«

16. Herod said: »It is John whom I beheaded, raised from the dead.«

17. For Herod captured John and locked him in prison for the sake of Herodias his wife. She was his brother Philips wife before he married her.

18. John said to Herod: »It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife.«

19. Herodias had a grudge against John and was determined to have him killed.

20. But Herod feared John. He knew he was a righteous and holy man so he kept him safe. That is why he listened to John but was perplexed.

21. It was Herods birthday. He invited his lords, the military commanders, and the prominent men of Galilee to supper.

22. When the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests, she pleased him so much he promised her anything she desired.

23. He pledged to her, »Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half of my kingdom.«

24. She asked her mother, »What should I ask?« And the mother said: »The head of John the Baptist.«

25. At once she went to the king and asked: »Will you give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«

26. The king was very sorry. Even so he kept his promise to her. He did not turn her down. This also showed his dinner guests he was a man of his word.

27. He immediately commanded his guard to behead John the Baptist and bring his head to him.

28. He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young lady. In turn she gave it to her mother.

29. When his disciples heard this they took his corpse and laid it in a tomb.

30. The apostles gathered together with Jesus. They told him all things they had done and taught.

31. He told them come into a secluded place and rest a while. For there were many people coming and going and they had no leisure time.

32. They went away in the boat to a secluded place.

33. The people from all the cities knew they were going and they ran together on foot to arrive ahead of them.

34. When he arrived and saw the great crowd he had compassion on them. They were as sheep without a shepherd. He taught them many things.

35. Late in the day his disciples approached him. They said: »The day is almost over and we are in a secluded place.

36. »Send them away that they may go to the country and villages nearby and buy themselves something to eat.«

37. He replied: »You give them food to eat.« They asked: »Should we buy two hundred shillings worth of bread to feed them?«

38. He said« »Find out how many loaves you have? When they knew they said« »Five loaves and two fishes.«

39. He commanded them to sit down by groups upon the green grass.

40. They sat down in groups of hundreds, and fifties.

41. Then he looked up to heaven and blessed the food. He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to his disciples. He also divided the two fishes. He gave the food to his disciples to serve to the people.

42. They all ate and were filled.

43. They collected twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and fishes.

44. Five thousand men ate.

45. Jesus made his disciples hurry into a boat to cross to Bethsaida ahead of him. Then he sent the crowd away.

46. After he left he went to the mountain to pray.

47. He was on the shore at the beginning of evening and the boat was in the midst of the sea.

48. He saw that they were tired of rowing for the wind was against them. It was the fourth watch of the night. He walked on the sea and was about to pass them.

49. When they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a spirit an illusion and screamed.

50. They all saw him and were troubled. Suddenly he spoke to them: »Be of good cheer. It is I do not fear.«

51. He entered the boat and the wind ceased. They were truly amazed.

52. They had not understood the loaves of bread. Their minds were closed.

53. They completed the crossing to the land of Gennesaret and anchored by the shore.

54. The people saw him as soon as they left the boat.

55. They were wherever he was in the whole region. They carried the sick on their beds to him.

56. When he entered a village or city in the marketplaces or the country the sick tried to touch the border of his garment and be healed.

## Mark 7

1. The Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem to gather around Jesus.

2. They saw that some of his disciples ate their bread with unwashed defiled hands.

3. For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat until they wash their hands. They practice the tradition of the elders.

4. When they come from the marketplace they wash themselves before they eat. They follow many other rules. They wash their cups, and brass pots, and other vessels.

5. The Pharisees and the scribes asked: »Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders. Instead they eat their bread with defiled hands?«

6. He told them: »Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites. It is written: This people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me.

7. They worship me in vain teaching as doctrines the commands of men.«

8. Speaking to the Pharisees and scribes He said: »You abandon the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.

9. »You totally reject the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition.

10. »Moses said: Honor your father and your mother. He also said: He that speaks evil of father or mother must die.

11. »But you say: If a man says to his father or his mother that which would benefit you is a gift to God,

12. he no longer has to do anything for his father or mother.

13. »You make the word of God invalid by your tradition.«

14. He called the crowd again and said: »Listen and understand!

15. »Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. That which comes from inside of a man can make him unclean.

16. »If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.«

17. When he entered the house away from the crowd his disciples asked him to explain.

18. He replied: »Do you not understand? Do you not know that which goes into the man from the outside cannot defile him?

19. »It is because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach and is eliminated? All foods are clean.

20. »That which comes out of the man defiles the man.

21. »It is from the heart that evil thoughts come such as: fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,

22. coveting, wickedness, deceit, loose conduct, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.

23. »All these evil things come from within and defile the man.«

24. Jesus went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He did not want anyone to know that he was staying in a house there. However it could not be kept a secret.

25. A woman whose little daughter had an evil spirit heard about Jesus. She went to him and bowed down.

26. The woman was a Greek Syrophoenician by race. She wanted him to drive out the demon out of her daughter.

27. He said to her: »Let the children be fed first. It is not proper to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs.«

28. She answered: »Yes Lord, even the dogs under the table eat from the childrens crumbs.«

29. Then he replied: »Thanks to your answer you may leave for the demon has gone out of your daughter.«

30. She went to her house and found the child on the bed with the demon gone.

31. He left the borders of Tyre through Sidon, through the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee.

32. They brought a deaf man with an impediment in his speech to him and asked him to lay his hands on him.

33. Jesus took him aside from the crowd privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.

34. Looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him: »Ephphatha, that is, be opened.«

35. His ears were opened. His tongue was freed and he spoke plainly.

36. Jesus told them not to tell anyone. The more he told them not to talk the more they talked.

37. They were beside themselves with amazement saying: He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak.

## Mark 8

1. It was one of those days when there was a great crowd of people. They had nothing to eat so he called his disciples.

2. Jesus said: »I am concerned for these people because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.

3. »If I send them away to their houses with no food they will be weak and faint. Some of them have a long way to go.«

4. His disciples answered, »How could we get enough bread in this desolate place?«

5. Jesus responded: »How much bread do you have?« They said: »Seven loaves.«

6. He made the people sit on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He gave the broken bread to his disciples and they served the people.

7. They had some small fish. After blessing them he had them serve the people in the same way.

8. After eating they picked up seven baskets full of food.

9. About four thousand ate. Then he sent them away.

10. Immediately he entered a boat and he and his disciples traveled to Dalmanutha.

11. The Pharisees came to question him. They were testing him and seeking a sign from heaven.

12. He sighed deeply in his spirit and said: »Why does this generation seek a sign? I tell you truly no sign will be given to this generation.«

13. He left them and boarded the boat and departed to the other side.

14. They forgot to take bread and they only had one loaf with them in the boat.

15. He ordered them to be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.

16. They reasoned with one another saying: »We have no bread.«

17. Hearing this Jesus said: »Why do you reason about having no bread? Do you not understand? Are your hearts dull of understanding?

18. »Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?

19. »When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you up bring back?« They answered: »Twelve.«

20. And the seven loaves among the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you bring back? And they told him: »Seven.«

21. He said: Do you not yet understand?

22. They arrived at Bethsaida. A blind man was brought to him with the request to touch him.

23. He held the blind mans hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him. He asked him: »Do you see?«

24. He answered: »I see men. They look like trees walking.«

25. He laid his hands on his eyes again and his vision was fully restored, he saw everything clearly.

26. He sent him to his home saying: »Do not enter into the village.«

27. Jesus and his disciples went into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples: »Who do men say I am?«

28. They told him: »John the Baptist and others say Elijah. Some say you are one of the prophets.«

29. »Who do you say I am,« Jesus asked. They told him: »You are the Christ.«

30. He commanded them not to tell any man.

31. Then he taught them that the Son of man must suffer many things. The elders, chief priests, and the scribes will reject him. He will be killed and after three days he will rise from the dead.

32. Jesus spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and rebuked him.

33. He turned around and looked at his disciples. Then he rebuked Peter saying: »Get behind me Satan for you do not pay attention to the things of God. You tend to the things of men.«

34. He then spoke to both his disciples and the crowd. He said: »If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his stake and follow me.

35. »Whoever would save his life will lose it. Whoever would lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.

36. »What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?

37. »What should a man give in exchange for his life?

38. »For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.«

## Mark 9

1. He continued: »Truly I tell you there are some here who will in no way experience death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power.«

2. Six days later Jesus took Peter, James and John up on a high mountain completely alone. He was transfigured in front of them.

3. His garments became brilliant white. Nothing on earth could make them this white.

4. Elijah and Moses appeared before them. They were talking with Jesus.

5. Peter said to Jesus: »Teacher it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«

6. Peter and the others were afraid and they did not know what to say.

7. A cloud hovered over them and a voice came out of the cloud: »This is my Son the beloved listen to him!«

8. Suddenly they saw no one near them except Jesus.

9. They came down the mountain. He warned them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead.

10. They kept questioning among themselves what the rising from the dead means.

11. Then they asked him how is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?

12. He said: »Elijah does come first and restores all things. It is written that the Son of man should suffer and be treated with contempt?

13. »But I say to you that Elijah has come. They have done to him what ever they wished just as it is written about him.«

14. When they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd with them and scribes questioning them.

15. Suddenly the crowd saw him and ran to him to greet him.

16. He asked them: »What are you talking about?«

17. One of the people answered him: »Teacher I brought my son who is unable to talk because of a spirit.

18. »The spirit seizes him and slams him down. He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. I asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do it.«

19. Jesus then said: »O faithless generation. How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.«

20. They brought the boy to him. Suddenly the spirit threw him into convulsions. He fell on the ground rolled around and foamed at the mouth.

21. Jesus asked his father: »How long has this been going on?« He said: »Since he was a child.«

22. Often it casts him into the fire and into the water to destroy him. If you can do anything have compassion on us and help us.

23. Jesus said to him: »All things are possible to him who has faith.«

24. Both father and child immediately shouted: »I have faith make my faith stronger.«

25. When Jesus saw the people he ordered the unclean spirit to come out of him. He commanded the spirit that caused the loss of voice and hearing to leave and never return to him.

26. The spirit cried out and shook the child violently. It came out and the child became like a dead person. Most of them said: »He is dead.«

27. Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up.

28. When the child went into the house his disciples asked him privately: »Why were we unable to send it out?«

29. He replied: Only prayer will make this sort come out.

30. He desired that no man know about it. Therefore they left there through Galilee.

31. He taught his disciples: »The Son of man will be handed over to men who will put him to death. After three days he will come back from the dead.«

32. They did not understand and they were afraid to ask him about it.

33. They traveled to Capernaum. When they were in the house he asked them: »What were you talking about on the way?«

34. They said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves about who was the greatest.

35. He sat down and the twelve came to him. He said: »If any man has the desire to be first, he would be last of all and servant of all.«

36. He put a little child in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them:

37. »Whoever receives a little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.«

38. John spoke up: »Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your name. We tried to stop him because he does not follow us.«

39. But Jesus said: »Do not stop him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.

40. »For whoever is not against us is on our side.

41. »Whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christs, most assuredly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.

42. »Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.

43. »If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better to enter into life maimed then, having two hands to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the Valley of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna

44. spurious, but included in King James Version, »Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.« 

45. »If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life with only one foot, rather than having two feet to be cast into the ever-burning fires of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna: symbolic of total destruction

46. The same wording as verse 44, spurious: Tischendorfs Spurious Passages

47. »If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom.

48. »For the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.« Questionable passage.

49. »For every one will be salted with fire.

50. »Salt is good. If it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again? Have the salt or seasoning of friendship among yourselves, and live in peace with one another.«

## Mark 10

1. Jesus crossed the Jordan River when he went to the province of Judea. Crowds gathered all around him just as they always did.

2. Some Pharisees came to him and tried to trap him. »Does our Law allow a man to divorce his wife?« They asked.

3. »What did Moses command you?« Jesus asked.

4. They said: »Moses allowed us to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.«

5. »He wrote this commandment because of your hard hearts,« Jesus replied.

6. »God made male and female from the beginning of creation.

7. »For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife.

8. »The two shall become one flesh. They are no longer two, but one flesh.

9. »That which God has joined together let not man take apart separate.«

10. In the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.

11. He said: »He who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.

12. »If she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.

13. People were bringing little children to him so he could touch them. His disciples turned them away.

14. But when Jesus saw it he was moved with indignation. He said: »Allow the little children to come to me! Do not turn them away for they belong to the kingdom of God.

15. »Truly I tell you, he who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall not enter it.«

16. He took them in his arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them.

17. As he traveled someone ran to him, kneeled and asked him: »Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life?«

18. Jesus asked him: »Why do you call me good? None is good except God.

19. »You know the commandments, do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.«

20. »Teacher,« he said: »I have observed all of these from my youth.«

21. Jesus lovingly looked at him and said: »You lack one thing. Go, sell your possessions and give to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.«

22. He was very sad when he heard this for he had many possessions. Then he went away.

23. Looking around Jesus said to his disciples: »It is hard for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!«

24. The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus repeated it again: »Children, it is hard to enter into the kingdom of God!

25. »It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.«

26. They were greatly astonished! So they asked him: »Who can be saved?«

27. Jesus looked at them: »With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.«

28. Peter said to him: »We have left all and followed you.«

29. Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, a man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the sake of the good news,

30. will receive a hundred times as much now in this time, and in the age to come everlasting life.

31. »Many that are first will be last and the last first.«

32. Jesus went to Jerusalem. The disciples followed him. They were amazed at what Jesus did. Others followed and were afraid. He met with the twelve to tell them the things that were to happen to him.

33. »When we go to Jerusalem the Son of man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the people of the nations.

34. »They will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him. Then they will kill him. After three days he will rise again.«

35. James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him saying: »Teacher, we want you to do for us what we ask of you.«

36. He asked: »What do you want me to do for you?

37. They said to him: »Allow us to sit next to you in your glory. One could sit on your right hand, and one on your left hand.«

38. »You do not know what you ask,« Jesus replied. »Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?«

39. They said: »We are able.« Jesus replied: »The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized you will be baptized.

40. »But to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give. It is for them for whom it has been prepared.«

41. When the ten heard it they were indignant with James and John.

42. Jesus called them together and said: »You know that those who rule over the nations lord it over them. Their great ones exercise authority over them.

43. »It is not so among you. Whoever would become great among you, shall be your minister servantattendant.

44. »Whoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.

45. »For the Son of man also came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.«

46. They arrived at Jericho. He left there with his disciples and a large crowd. A blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the side of the road.

47. When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he cried: »Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!«

48. Many rebuked him that he should keep quiet. However he cried out even more: »You son of David have mercy on me.«

49. Jesus stood still and said: »You call him.« They called the blind man saying to him, »Be of good cheer: rise, he calls you.«

50. Setting aside his garment, he sprang up, and came to Jesus.

51. Jesus responded to him: »What do you want me to do for you?« The blind man said to him: »Teacher I want to receive my sight!«

52. Jesus told him: »Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way.«

## Mark 11

1. They came close to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives. He appointed two of his disciples to

2. go into the village that is nearby. »As soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied there. No man has ever sat on that colt. Untie him and bring him.

3. »If any one questions why you do this say: The Lord has need of him. Immediately he will send it here.«

4. They found a colt tied at the door in the open street and they untied it.

5. Those who stood there asked why are you untying the colt?

6. They told them what Jesus said and they let them go.

7. The colt was brought to Jesus. They laid their garments on him and Jesus sat on him.

8. Many spread their garments along the way. Others spread branches, which they cut from the fields.

9. Those who led the way and those who followed cried: »Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in Jehovahs name!

10. »Blessed is the coming kingdom, the kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest!«

11. He entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. When evening came he went with the twelve to Bethany.

12. The next day they left Bethany. He was hungry.

13. He saw a fig tree far off. When he got closer he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season of figs.

14. He spoke about the tree that no man would ever eat fruit from it from that day forward.

15. When in Jerusalem he entered the temple and turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the people who sold doves.

16. He would not allow any man to carry merchandise through the temple.

17. When he taught, he said: »Is it not written, my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers.«

18. The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. They feared him because the crowd was astonished at his teaching.

19. And every evening he left the city.

20. They passed by in the morning and saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.

21. Peter remembered and said: »Teacher look, the fig tree that you cursed is withered away.«

22. Jesus answered: »Have faith in God.

23. »Truly I say faithful ones shall say to this mountain, be cast into the sea and it will happen. There must be no doubt in his heart and he must believe that what he says will come to pass.

24. »I tell you, believe that you receive what you pray for and you shall have it.

25. »When you say a prayer have forgiveness in your heart. Forgive anything you have against anyone so that your Heavenly Father will forgive you your sins.«

26. omitted text

27. Chief priests and scribes approached him at the Temple in Jerusalem.

28. They said to him: »By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you authority to do these things?«

29. Jesus said: »I will ask you one question. Give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things.«

30. »The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men?« Give me an answer.

31. They thought about it among themselves saying: »If we say from heaven he will say why did you not have faith in him?«

32. They feared the people. »If we say from men the people would not like it because they all thought John was a true prophet.«

33. They told Jesus« »We have no idea.« Jesus said to them: »I should not say to you by what authority I do these things.«

## Mark 12

1. He taught them with illustrations: »A man had a vineyard planted. He built a wall around it. He prepared a place for crushing out the wine and put up a tower. Then he rented it out to field workers, and went into another country.

2. »During the season he sent a servant to the field workers that he might receive the fruits of the vineyard.

3. »They beat him and sent him away empty.

4. »Again he sent another servant and they treated him shamefully and wounded him in the head.

5. »He sent another and they killed him. He sent many others and some were beaten and some were killed.

6. »Last of all he sent his son saying: They will respect my son.

7. »But those field workers said among themselves: This is the heir let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.

8. »They captured him and killed him. Then they cast his body out of the vineyard.

9. »What will the lord of the vineyard do? He will destroy the field workers and give the vineyard to others.

10. »Have you not read this Scripture: The stone the builders rejected was made the chief corner stone. (Psalm 118:22, 23)

11. »This was from Jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes?« (Psalm 118:23)

12. They tried to capture him but feared the crowd. They perceived that he spoke the illustration against them. So they left him and went away.

13. Pharisees and Herodians went to him that they might catch him in talk.

14. »Teacher,« they said, »we know that you are truthful, and not concerned about what other people think. You truthfully teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?

15. »Should we pay or should we not pay?« Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them:« Why do you test me? Show me a denarius.«

16. And they brought it. He said to them: »Whose is this image and superscription?« They said: »Caesars.«

17. Jesus said: »Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.« They greatly marveled at him.

18. Sadducees say that there is no resurrection. They came to him to ask a question:

19. »Teacher, Moses wrote that if a mans brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.

20. »There were seven brothers the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.

21. »The second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him. The third also died without leaving a seed.

22. »The seven left no seed. The woman also died.

23. »In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? For each of the seven had her as wife.«

24. Jesus replied: »Is it not for this cause that you err? You do not know the scriptures or the power of God.

25. »For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.

26. »It is a fact that the dead will be raised again. Have you not read the account of the burning bush in the book of Moses? Did you notice how God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

27. »He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are greatly mistaken.«

28. One of the other scribes came to him with a question: »What commandment is the first of all?«

29. Jesus answered: »The first is, Hear, O Israel; Jehovah our God is one God Jehovah.

30. »You should love Jehovah your God with all your heart, and with all your being with every breath you takeyour life, with your entire mind and with all your strength. (Deuteronomy 6:4)

31. »The second is you should love your neighbor as yourself. No other commandment is greater than these.« (Leviticus 19:18)

32. The scribe said to him: »It is true teacher youve said it well that he is one and there is no one else besides him.

33. »To love him with all the heart, and with all understanding, and with total strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.«

34. When Jesus saw that he answered intelligently he said to him: »You are not far from the kingdom of God. No man dared ask any questions after that.«

35. Still teaching in the temple Jesus said: »Do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?

36. »Inspired by Holy Spirit David said: Jehovah said to my Lord sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. (Psalm 110:1)

37. »David called him Lord. How is it that he is his son?« The people were pleased with what he said.

38. He said: »Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and to have greetings in the marketplaces.

39. »They demand the front seats in the synagogues and prominent places at feasts.

40. »They devour widows houses and for pretence make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.«

41. He sat down near the collection boxes and observed how the crowd dropped money into the boxes. Many that were rich dropped in much.

42. A poor widow came along and dropped in two mites.

43. He told his disciples: »Truly I tell you this poor widow gave more then all the others who gave to the collection box.

44. »They all gave out of their surplus. She gave out of her poverty. She gave all that she owned, all her living.«

## Mark 13

1. As he left the temple one of his disciples said to him: »Teacher look at these stones and the great buildings!«

2. Jesus said: »See these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another. They will all be thrown down.«

3. He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple. Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately:

4. »Tell us when will these things be? What will be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished?«

5. Jesus warned them: »Take heed that no man lead you astray.

6. »Many will come in my name Greek: onoma: claiming my authority, saying, I am he; and will lead many astray.

7. »When you hear of wars and rumors reports of wars do not be troubled. These things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.

8. »Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines. These things are the beginning of pain sorrowtrouble.

9. »Be on guard for they will deliver you up to courts. You will be beaten in the meeting places. You will be taken before governors and kings for a testimony to them for my sake.

10. »And the good news must first be preached to all the nations.

11. »When they deliver you up to judgment, do not worry before hand what you shall speak. Holy Spirit will give it to you at that time.

12. »Brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.

13. »All men will hate you because of my name. He who endures to the end will be saved.

14. »When you see the unclean thing that makes desolation standing where he ought not let the reader use discernment, then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains.

15. »He who is on the housetop should not go down to enter and take anything out his house.

16. »He who is in the field should not return to take his clothes.

17. »Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!

18. »Pray that this not be in the winter.

19. »The tribulation in these days will be greater then there has ever been from the beginning of Gods creation until now, and never shall be.

20. »Unless Jehovah shortened the days no flesh would be saved. For the sake of his chosen anointed he will shorten the days.

21. »If any man will say to you here is the Christ or there is the Christ do not believe it.

22. »There will arise false Christs and false prophets. They show signs and wonders that will mislead many, even the anointed.

23. »Be alert for I have told you all things beforehand.

24. »In those days after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light.

25. »The stars will fall from heaven and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.

26. »They will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.

27. »He will send the angels to gather together his anointed from the four winds, from one end of the earth to the other end of heaven.

28. »Learn the illustration of the fig tree. When her branch is tender and she sprouts leaves you know summer is near.

29. »So when you see these things happening you know that he is near, even at the doors.

30. »Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.

31. »Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away.

32. »No one knows the day or hour. The angels in heaven do not know. The Son of God does not know. Only the Father knows!

33. »Be awake bewarebe cautious and active, watch perceive and pray, for you do not know the time.

34. »It is similar to a man traveling to another country. He leaves his house and gives authority to his servants to do the work. He commands them to watch.

35. »Watch therefore for you do not know when the lord of the house comes. It could be in the evening, at midnight or in the morning when the cock crows.

36. »He could come suddenly and find you sleeping.

37. »What I say to you I say to all, be on the watch be vigilantstay awakebe circumspectattentive and ready!«

## Mark 14

1. It was just two days until the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might quietly capture and kill him.

2. They said: »Not during the feast for it might cause the people to riot.«

3. He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper. While he was dining a woman with an alabaster vase filled with costly perfume, of pure nard spikenard, brake it open and poured it over his head.

4. Some were very indignant over this. They asked, »What was the purpose of this waste of ointment?

5. »This ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii. And the money could have been given to the poor. They scolded her.«

6. Jesus said: »Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She did a good thing to me.

7. »You always have the poor with you and you can do them good. You do not always have me.

8. »She did what she could! She anointed my body beforehand for burying.

9. »Truly I tell you everywhere the good news is preached through out the whole world, that which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her.«

10. Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might betray Jesus to them.

11. They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money. He looked for ways how he might conveniently deliver Jesus to them.

12. Now it was the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover. His disciples said to him: »Where do you want to go to prepare to eat the Passover?«

13. He sent two of his disciples into the city. He said: »Meet a man bearing a pitcher of water and follow him.

14. »Where he leads you say to the master of the house: The Teacher says where is my guest-chamber? Where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

15. »He will show you a large upper room. It is furnished and ready. Prepare it for us.«

16. The disciples went to the city and found everything as he described and they prepared for the Passover.

17. When it was evening he came with the twelve.

18. While they sat and ate Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, even he that eats with me.«

19. They were sorrowful and said to him one by one: »Is it I?«

20. He said to them: »It is one of the twelve, he that dips with me in the dish.

21. »The Son of man goes even as it is written of him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better if he had not been born.«

22. While they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said: »Take it, this means represents my body.«

23. He took a cup, and when he had given praise, he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it.

24. He said: »This means represents my blood of the covenant given for men.

25. »Truly I say to you, I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God.«

26. After a song of praise to God they went to the Mount of Olives.

27. Jesus told them: »You would all be turned away from me. It is written, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight.

28. »After I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.«

29. Peter declared to him: »Even though all shall leave you I will not.«

30. Jesus said to Peter: »I tell you that before the rooster crows twice tonight, you will say three times that you do not know me.«

31. Peter answered even more strongly: »I will never say that, even if I have to die with you!« All the other disciples said the same thing.

32. They came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: »Sit here while I pray.«

33. He took Peter, James and John with him. He was very distressed and troubled.

34. He said to them: »I am very sorrowful to the point of death. Stay here with me and watch.«

35. He went forward a little ways and fell on the ground to pray. He prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.

36. He said: »Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Take this cup from me. Even so not what I will, but what you will.«

37. He returned to find them sleeping. He said to Peter, »Simon why do you sleep? Could you not watch for one hour?

38. »To avoid temptation watch and pray. The spirit truly is willing but the flesh is weak.«

39. Again he went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.

40. He came and found them asleep again. They did not know what to say to him.

41. He came a third time and said to them: »Sleep and take your rest. It is enough the hour has come. Look, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners!

42. »Rise up and let us go. He that betrays me is near.«

43. Suddenly, as he spoke, Judas one of the twelve arrived. A great crowd with swords and spears were with him. They were from the chief priests, scribes and elders.

44. He who betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them the one I kiss is the one to capture and take away safely.

45. When he arrived he went straight to him and said: »Master« and kissed him.

46. They grabbed him and took him away.

47. One of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.

48. Jesus said: »Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me?

49. »I was with you every day in the Temple teaching and you did not take me. This is done so that the scriptures will be fulfilled.«

50. They all left him, and fled.

51. A young man followed him. He was wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. They tried to grab him.

52. But they got a hold of the linen cloth and he fled naked.

53. They led Jesus away to the high priest. The chief priests, elders and scribes came together with him.

54. Peter followed him at a distance. He followed into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers staying warm by the fire.

55. Now the chief priests and the whole council looked for witness against Jesus to put him to death. They found none.

56. Many gave false witness against him. But their witness was not in agreement.

57. One person falsely witnessed against him by saying:

58. »We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.«

59. Even so their witness did not agree.

60. The high priest stood in the middle of them, and said to Jesus: »Do you not answer? What is it these say against you?«

61. But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioned him: »Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One?«

62. Jesus said: »I am and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.«

63. Violently parting his robes, the high priest said: »What need do we have for more witnesses?«

64. We have heard his words against God. What is your opinion? They all said he should be put to death.

65. Some spit on him and covering his face they gave him blows. Guess who hit you, they said. The leaders took him and beat him with their hands.

66. Peter was still in the courtyard when one of the High Priests servant women came by.

67. When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said: »You were with Jesus of Nazareth.«

68. He denied it. »I do not know and I do not understand what you are talking about,« he answered. He went out into the passageway.

69. The servant woman saw him there and told bystanders, »He is one of them!«

70. Peter denied it again. Later the bystanders accused Peter again saying: »You cannot deny that you are one of them, because you, too, are from Galilee.«

71. Then Peter said: »I swear I am telling the truth! May God punish me if I lie! I do not know the man you are talking about!«

72. Then a rooster crowed. Peter remembered what Jesus said: »Before the rooster crows two times, you will deny me three times.« He broke down and cried.

## Mark 15

1. Early in the morning the chief priests met hurriedly with the elders, the teachers of the Law, and the entire Council. They made their plans. They led Jesus away in chains and handed him over to Pilate.

2. Pilate questioned him: »Are you the king of the Jews?« Jesus answered: »You say so.«

3. The chief priests accused him of many things.

4. Pilate again asked him: »Do you not answer? See how many things they testify against you!«

5. But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate wondered.

6. He used to release one prisoner at the feast. This was done by request.

7. Barabbas, a rebel and a murderer was available for this purpose.

8. The crowd cried aloud and asked him to do as he always did for them.

9. Pilate answered them, saying: »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«

10. For he knew that it was out of envy the chief priests delivered him up.

11. The chief priests influenced the crowd, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.

12. »What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?« Pilate asked.

13. They cried out: »Impale him!«

14. Pilate said: »Why, what evil has he done?« But they cried out exceedingly, »Impale him!«

15. Wishing to please the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. Then he handed over Jesus. He was flogged and impaled.

16. The soldiers led him away to the court in the Praetorium building governors palace. They assembled together all of the troops.

17. They clothed him with purple. After weaving a crown of thorns they put it on him.

18. »Hail King of the Jews!« They shouted at him.

19. They struck his head with a reed and spat on him. They bowed their knees in false adoration to him.

20. After they mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to impale him.

21. Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus was passing by on the road. They compelled forced him to go with them, that he might carry his stake.

22. They brought him to the place called Golgotha. This means the place of a skull.

23. They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it.

24. After impaling him, they divided his garments among themselves, casting lots for them.

25. It was the third hour. They impaled him.

26. The superscription of his accusation was written on a board above his head, »THE KING OF THE JEWS.«

27. They impaled two robbers with him, one on his right hand, and one on his left.

28. The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, »He was numbered with transgressors.«

29. Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, »ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,

30. save yourself, and come down from the stake!«

31. Likewise, also the chief priests mocked among themselves with the scribes said, »He saved others. He cannot save himself.

32. »Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down from the stake that we may see and believe him.« Those who were impaled with him also mocked him.

33. It was the sixth hour and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

34. At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: »Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?« Interpreted it means, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«

35. Some of those who stood by said: »He is calling Elijah.«

36. They filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. Then they said let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down.

37. Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed his last breath of life.

38. The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.

39. The centurion who stood nearby heard him cry out his last breath. Then he said: »Truly this man was the Son of God!«

40. The women watching from afar included: Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome,

41. who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him. Many other women came up with him to Jerusalem.

42. Evening arrived. It was the Preparation Day (Exodus 16:22-27), the day before the Sabbath.

43. Joseph of Arimathaea was a prominent council member who also was looking for the Kingdom of God. He boldly approached Pilate and asked for Jesus body.

44. Pilate wondered if he were already dead. So he summoned the centurion and asked him about the death.

45. When the centurion confirmed it he granted the body to Joseph.

46. He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth. Then he laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.

47. Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.

## Mark 16

1. After Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices so they could anoint him.

2. They went to the tomb when the sun had risen. It was very early.

3. They asked each other who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb?

4. The stone was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.

5. They entered the tomb. They were amazed at what they saw. A young man dressed in a white robe was sitting on the right side of the tomb.

6. He said to them: »Do not be amazed. Jesus the Nazarene, who has been impaled, is not here. He has risen. Behold, the place where they laid him!

7. »Go tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him just as he told you.«

8. They fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone for they were afraid.

9. Verses 9 through 20 not in some older manuscripts After he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene. She was the one who had the seven demons that he cast out.

10. She told those who had been with him, for they mourned and wept.

11. When they heard that he was alive and she had seen him they did not believe it.

12. After this two of them saw him in another form as they walked, on their way into the country.

13. They went to tell the rest. They didnt believe them, either.

14. Afterward he was revealed to the eleven as they sat at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.

15. He said to them, »Go into the entire world, and preach the good news to the whole creation.

16. »He who believes and is baptized will be saved. He who does not believe will be condemned.

17. »These signs will accompany those who believe. They will cast out demons in my name. They will speak with new languages.

18. »They will pick up and handle serpents. Deadly drink will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.«

19. After he had spoken to them the Lord Jesus, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.

20. They went out and preached everywhere. The Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
