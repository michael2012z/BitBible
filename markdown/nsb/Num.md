3. »Send all of these unclean men and women outside the camp. They must not make this camp where I live among you unclean.«

4. Thus the Israelites did as Jehovah told Moses. They sent these unclean people outside the camp.

5. Jehovah said to Moses:

6. »Tell the Israelites: If you do something wrong to another person, you have been unfaithful to Jehovah. When you realize your guilt,

7. you must confess your sin, pay in full for what you did wrong, add one-fifth to it, and give it to the person who was wronged.

8. »There may be no heir to whom the payment can be made. In that case, the payment for what you did wrong must be given to Jehovah for the priest to use. This payment is in addition to the ram that is used to pay compensation for the wrongdoing makes peace with Jehovah.

10. »Each persons holy offerings will belong to that person. Everything given to the priest will belong to the priest.«

11. Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:

12. »Speak to the Israelites and say: A mans wife may have been unfaithful to him

13. and may have had sexual intercourse with another man without her husbands knowledge. She may have kept it secret if there were no witnesses to accuse her and she was not caught in the act.

14. »A husband may have a fit of jealousy and suspect his wife, whether she was actually unfaithful or not.

15. »He must then take his wife to the priest along with eight cups of barley flour as an offering for her. He must not pour olive oil on the flour or put frankincense on it, since it is a grain offering brought because of the husbands jealousy. It is an offering used for a confession, to remind someone of a sin that was committed.

16. »The priest will have the woman come forward and stand in Jehovahs presence.

17. »The priest will then take holy water in a piece of pottery and put some dust from the floor of the tent into the water.

18. »The priest will bring the woman into Jehovahs presence and loosen her hair. In her hands he will put the offering used for a confession, that is, the grain offering brought because of the husbands jealousy. The priest will hold the bitter water that can bring a curse in his hands.

19. »The priest will say to her: If no other man has had sexual intercourse with you and you have not been unfaithful to your husband, you are not guilty. This bitter water that can bring a curse will not harm you.

20. »If you have indeed been unfaithful and have had sexual intercourse with another man,

21. »Jehovah will make you an example for your people to see what happens when the curse of this oath comes true: Jehovah will make your uterus drop and your stomach swell. Then the priest will administer the oath and the curse by saying:

22. »May this water that can bring a curse go into your body and make your stomach swell and your uterus drop!« Then the woman will say: »Amen!« »Amen!«

23. »The priest will write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water.

24. »He will have the woman drink the bitter water that can bring the curse. This water will go into her and become bitter.

25. »The priest will take the grain offering she was holding. He will present it to Jehovah, and bring it to the altar.

26. »The priest will take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar. Then he will have the woman drink the water.

27. »If she has become unclean by being unfaithful to her husband, the water that can bring the curse will go into her and become bitter. Her stomach will swell, her uterus will drop, and she will become cursed among her people.

28. »However if the woman is not unclean and is pure, she is not guilty and will be able to have children.

29. »These are the instructions for how to deal with jealousy. They tell you what to do when a woman is unfaithful to her husband and becomes unclean.

30. »They also tell you what to do when a husband has a fit of jealousy and is suspicious of his wife. He will make his wife stand in Jehovahs presence. The priest will do everything these instructions tell him to do.

31. »The husband is not guilty of doing anything wrong. But the woman will suffer the consequences of her sin.«

## Numbers 6

2. »Tell the Israelites: A man or a woman may make a special vow to live as a Nazirite dedicated to Jehovah.

3. »Nazirites must never drink wine, liquor, vinegar made from wine or liquor, or any kind of grape juice. They must never eat fresh grapes or raisins.

4. »As long as they are Nazirites they must never eat anything that comes from a grapevine, not even grape seeds or skins.

5. »As long as they are under the Nazirite vow no razor may touch their heads. During the entire time that they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites, they will be holy. They must let their hair grow long.

6. »While they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites, they must never go near a dead body.

7. »Even if their own father, mother, brother, or sister dies, they must not make themselves unclean by going near them. Nazarites show their vow to God with their long hair.

8. »As long as they are Nazirites, they will be holy to Jehovah.

9. »Someone might suddenly drop dead next to a Nazirite and make the Nazirites hair unclean. Seven days later he must shave his head in order to be declared clean.

10. »The eighth day he must bring two mourning doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

11. »The priest will sacrifice one as an offering for sin and the other one as a burnt offering. The priest will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the person who touched the dead body. That same day the person must dedicate his head again.

12. »Once again he will dedicate himself to Jehovah as a Nazirite for the same length of time as before. He must bring a one-year-old male lamb as an offering for guilt. The first time period will not count. He has to start over from when he became unclean.

13. »These are the instructions for Nazirites to complete their vows: They must come to the entrance of the tent of meeting.

14. »They are to bring these offerings to Jehovah: a one-year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, a one-year-old female lamb as an offering for sin, and a ram as a fellowship offering. All of these animals must have no defects.

15. »They must also bring a basket of unleavened bread containing some rings of bread made with olive oil and wafers of unleavened bread brushed with olive oil, along with other grain offerings and wine offerings.

16. »The priest will bring these offerings to Jehovah. He will make the offering for sin and the burnt offering.

17. »He will sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to Jehovah. He will offer the basket of unleavened bread along with it, and make the grain offerings and wine offerings.

18. »The Nazirites will shave their heads at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then they will take the hair as proof that they had made this vow, and put it on the fire under the fellowship offering.

19. »The priest will take one of the shoulders from a boiled ram, one ring of unleavened bread from the basket, and one wafer of unleavened bread and hand them to the Nazirites after they have shaved off their hair.

20. »The priest will present them as an offering to Jehovah. They are holy and belong to the priest, along with the rams breast that is presented and the thigh that is given. After that, the Nazirites may drink wine.«

21. »These are the instructions for those who have vowed to bring their offerings to Jehovah as Nazirites. They must bring these offerings in addition to anything else they can afford. They must fulfill the requirements of these instructions for Nazirites and finish whatever they vowed to do.«

22. Jehovah said to Moses:

23. »Tell Aaron and his sons: This is how you will bless the Israelites. Say to them:

24. »»Jehovah will bless you and watch over you.« «

25. »»Jehovah will smile on you and be kind to you.

26. »»Jehovah will look on you with favor and give you peace!

27. »»Whenever they use my name to bless the Israelites, I will bless them.« «

2. The leaders of Israel, the heads of the households, those tribal leaders who helped in the census came to give their offerings.

3. They brought these gifts to Jehovah: six freight wagons and twelve oxen, one wagon from every two leaders and one ox from each leader. They brought them in front of the tent.

4. Jehovah said to Moses:

5. »Accept these gifts from them to use in the work done for the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites to use where they need them for their work.«

6. Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.

7. He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites for the work they had to do.

8. He gave four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites for the work they had to do under the direction of Ithamar, son of the priest Aaron.

9. However Moses gave none of these gifts to the Kohathites, because they took care of the holy things. They had to carry the holy things on their own shoulders.

89. When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Jehovah, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the throne of mercy on the Ark containing the words of Gods Covenant, from between the two cherubim. This is how Jehovah spoke with Moses.

## Numbers 8

1. Jehovah said to Moses:

2. »Speak to Aaron and tell him: When you set up the seven lamps on the lamp stand, they should illuminate the area in front of it.«

3. So Aaron set up the lamps on the lamp stand to illuminate the area in front of it, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

4. This is how the lamp stand was made: The whole lamp stand, from top to bottom, was hammered out of gold. It was made exactly like the one Jehovah had shown Moses.

5. Jehovah said to Moses:

6. »Separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites. Make them clean.

7. »This is what you must do to make them clean: Sprinkle them with water to take away their sins. Make them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. Then they will be clean.

8. »They must take a young bull and the grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil that is offered with it. You must take a second young bull as an offering for sin.

9. »Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting. Assemble the whole congregation of Israel.

10. »Then bring the Levites into Jehovahs presence, and the Israelites will place their hands on them.

11. »Aaron will present the Levites to Jehovah as an offering from the Israelites. Then they will be ready to do Jehovahs work.

12. »The Levites will place their hands on the heads of the young bulls. Sacrifice one of them as an offering for sin and the other one as a burnt offering to Jehovah. These sacrifices will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the Levites.

13. »Make the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons, and present them as an offering to Jehovah.

14. »In this way you will separate the Levites from the other Israelites. The Levites will be mine.

15. »Once you have made them clean and presented them as an offering, the Levites may come and do their work at the tent of meeting.

16. »They will be the only Israelites given to me. I have taken them to be mine as substitutes for every firstborn male offspring of the Israelites.

17. »When I killed all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated as my own the oldest son of each Israelite family and the first-born of every animal.

18. »I am now taking the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites.

19. »I assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, as a gift from the Israelites. They are to work in the tent for the people of Israel and to protect the Israelites from the disaster that would strike them if they came too near the Holy Place.«

20. Moses, Aaron, and all the people of Israel dedicated the Levites, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

21. So the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Aaron dedicated them as a special gift to Jehovah. He also performed the ritual of purification for them.

22. The people did everything Jehovah commanded Moses concerning the Levites. Thus the Levites were qualified to work in the tent under Aaron and his sons.

23. Jehovah said to Moses:

24. »From the age of twenty-five each Levite shall perform his duties in the tent of my presence,

25. »They must retire from active service when they are fifty years old.

26. »They may assist the other Levites in their duties at the tent of meeting. But they may not do any regular work. This is how you will handle the Levites duties.«

## Numbers 9

1. Jehovah spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after the Israelites left Egypt. He said:

2. »The Israelites should celebrate the Passover at the same time every year.

3. »You must celebrate it on the fourteenth day of this month at dusk. Follow all the rules and regulations for the celebration of the Passover.«

4. So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover.

5. They celebrated it on the fourteenth day of the first month at dusk while they were in the Desert of Sinai. The Israelites did everything as Jehovah commanded Moses.

6. There were some men who had become unclean from touching a dead body. They could not celebrate the Passover that day. They went to Moses and Aaron.

7. They said: »We are unclean because we touched a dead body. Why are we prevented from making our offerings to Jehovah at the same time the rest of the Israelites bring their offerings?«

8. Moses answered: »Wait here until I find out what Jehovah commands you to do.«

9. Jehovah said to Moses, »Tell the Israelites:

10. »Should you or any of your descendants be unclean from touching a dead body or away on a long trip. You may still celebrate the Passover.

11. »You will celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month at dusk. Eat the Passover animal along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

12. »Never leave any of the meat until morning or break any of the animals bones. Follow all the rules for the Passover when you celebrate it.

13. »If you are clean and not on a trip and yet do not bother to celebrate the Passover, you must be excluded from the people. You did not bring your offering to Jehovah at the right time. You must suffer the consequences for your sin.

14. »Foreigners living with you may want to celebrate Jehovahs Passover. They must follow these same rules and regulations. The same rules will apply to foreigners and native-born Israelites.«

15. That day the tent of the words of Gods Covenant was set up. The column of smoke covered it. The smoke over the tent glowed like fire from evening until morning.

16. The smoke always glowed this way. At night the smoke that covered the tent glowed like fire.

17. When the smoke moved from the tent the Israelites would break camp. Wherever it stopped the Israelites would set up camp.

18. The Israelites would break camp or set up camp at Jehovahs command. They stayed at the place where the column of smoke stayed over the tent.

19. When the smoke stayed over the tent for a long time, the Israelites obeyed Jehovahs command and did not break camp.

20. The same thing happened when the smoke stayed only a few days over the tent: At Jehovahs command they would set up camp, and at his command they would break camp.

21. Sometimes the column of smoke stayed only from evening until morning. They broke camp when the smoke moved in the morning. Day or night, when the smoke moved, they broke camp.

22. Whether it was two days, a month, or a year, as long as the column of smoke stayed over the tent, the Israelites stayed in the same place. But when the smoke moved, they would break camp and move.

23. At Jehovahs command they set up camp, and at his command they broke camp. They obeyed the command Jehovah gave through Moses.

## Numbers 10

1. Jehovah said to Moses:

2. »Make two trumpets of hammered silver to use for calling the people together and for breaking camp.

3. »When long blasts are sounded on both trumpets, the whole community is to gather around you at the entrance to the tent of my presence.

4. »When only one trumpet is sounded, then only the leaders of the clans are to gather around you.

5. »When short blasts are sounded, the tribes camped on the east will move out.

6. »When short blasts are sounded a second time, the tribes on the south will move out. So short blasts are to be sounded to break camp,

7. »Long blasts are to be sounded to call the congregation together.

8. »Aarons sons the priests are to blow the trumpets. The following rule is to be observed for all time to come.

9. »When there is war in your land and you defend yourselves against an enemy attack, sound the signal for battle on these trumpets. I, Jehovah your God, will help you and save you from your enemies.

10. »Joyful occasions such as your New Moon Festivals and your other religious festivals, you are to blow the trumpets when you present your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings. Then I will help you. I AM JEHOVAH YOUR GOD!«

11. The cloud over the tent of Jehovahs presence lifted the twentieth day of the second month in the second year after the people left Egypt.

12. At last the Israelites started on their journey out of the Sinai Desert. The cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran.

13. Jehovah gave the command through Moses for them to march.

14. They were in the same order each time they moved. Those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Judah started out first, company by company, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command.

15. Nethanel son of Zuar was in command of the tribe of Issachar.

16. Eliab son of Helon was in command of the tribe of Zebulun.

17. Then the tent would be taken down. The clans of Gershon and Merari carried it.

18. Next, the banner of the division led by the tribe of Reuben would start out, company by company. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.

19. Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was in command of the tribe of Simeon,

20. and Eliasaph son of Deuel was in command of the tribe of Gad.

21. The Levite clan of Kohath started the march. They carried the sacred objects. By the time they arrived at the next camp, the tent had been set up again.

22. Next, the banner of the division led by the tribe of Ephraim would start out, company by company, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command.

23. Gamaliel son of Pedahzur commanded the tribe of Manasseh.

24. Abidan son of Gideoni commanded the tribe of Benjamin.

25. Finally, the banner of the division led by the tribe of Dan, serving as the rear guard of all the divisions, started out, company by company. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.

26. Pagiel son of Ochran commanded the tribe of Asher.

27. Ahira son of Enan commanded the tribe of Naphtali.

28. This was the order of march, company by company, when the Israelites broke camp and set out.

29. Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab son of Jethro the Midianite: We are about to start out for the place Jehovah said he would give us. He promised to make Israel prosperous, so come with us, and we will share our prosperity with you.

30. Hobab answered: »No, I am going back to my native land.«

31. « Please do not leave us,« Moses said. »You know where we can camp in the desert. You can be our guide.

32. »If you come with us, we will share with you all the blessings that Jehovah gives us.«

33. The people left Sinai, the holy mountain. They traveled three days. Jehovahs Ark of the Covenant always went ahead of them to find a place for them to camp.

34. They moved camp to camp with the cloud of Jehovah over them by day.

35. When the Ark of the Covenant started out, Moses would say: »ARISE, JEHOVAH; scatter your enemies and put to flight those who hate you!«

36. And when it stopped, he would say: »RETURN, O JEHOVAH, to the countless thousands of Israel!«

## Numbers 11

1. The people complained out loud to Jehovah about their troubles. Jehovah heard them and he became angry. Fire from Jehovah burned among them. It destroyed some people on the outskirts of the camp.

2. The people cried out to Moses. Moses prayed to Jehovah! And the fire died down.

3. That place was called Taberah Fire because fire from Jehovah burned among them there.

4. Some foreigners among the Israelites had a strong craving for other kinds of food. Even the Israelites cried again and said: »If only we had meat to eat!

5. »Remember all the free fish we ate in Egypt and the cucumbers, watermelons, leeks, onions, and garlic we had?

6. »Now we have lost our appetite! Everywhere we look there is nothing but manna!«

7. Manna was small like coriander seeds and looked like resin.

8. The people would gather it and then grind it in a hand mill or crush it in a mortar. They would cook it in a pot or make round loaves of bread out of it. It tasted like rich sweet pastry made with oil.

9. When dew fell on the camp at night, manna fell with it.

10. Moses heard people from every family cry at the entrance to their tents. Jehovah became very angry. Moses did not like it either.

11. So he asked: »Jehovah, why have you brought me this trouble? How have I displeased you that you put the burden of all these people on me?

12. »Am I their mother? Did I give birth to them? Are you really asking me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries a baby, all the way to the land you promised their ancestors with an oath?

13. »Where can I get meat for all these people? They continually cry for me to give them meat to eat.

14. »I am not able to take care of all these people by myself. This is too much work for me!

15. »If you treat me like this have pity on me and kill me. That way I will not have to endure my shame any longer.«

16. Jehovah replied to Moses: »Assemble seventy respected men who are recognized as elders of the people. Bring them to me at the tent of my presence, and tell them to stand there beside you.

17. »I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the spirit I have given and give it to them. Then they can help you bear the responsibility for these people. You will not have to bear it alone.

18. »Tell the people: Purify yourselves for tomorrow. You will have meat to eat! Jehovah has heard you whining and saying that you wished you had some meat and that you were better off in Egypt. Jehovah will now give you meat, and you will have to eat it.

19. »You will have to eat it not just for one or two days, or five, or ten, or even twenty days.

20. »You will eat it for a whole month, until it comes out of your nose, until you are sick of it. This will happen because you have rejected Jehovah who is here among you and have complained to him that you should not have left Egypt.«

21. Moses said to Jehovah: »Here I am leading six hundred thousand people, and you say that you will give them enough meat for a month?«

22. »Could enough cattle and sheep even be killed to satisfy them? Are all the fish in the sea enough for them?

23. »Is there a limit to my power?« Jehovah answered. »You will soon see whether what I have said will happen or not!«

24. Thus Moses went out and told the people what Jehovah said. He assembled seventy of the leaders and placed them around the tent.

25. Jehovah came down in the cloud and spoke to him. He took some of the spirit he had given to Moses and gave it to the seventy elders. When the Spirit came on them, they began to shout like prophets, but not for long.

26. Two of the seventy elders, Eldad and Medad, stayed in the camp and did not go out to the tent. There in the camp the Spirit came on them, and they too began to shout like prophets.

27. A young man ran out to tell Moses what Eldad and Medad were doing.

28. Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses helper since he was a young man, spoke up and said to Moses: »Stop them, sir!«

29. Moses asked him: »Do you think you need to stand up for me? I wish all Jehovahs people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his Spirit on them!«

30. Then Moses and the elders of Israel went back to the camp.

31. Jehovah sent a wind from the sea that brought quails and dropped them all around the camp. There were quails on the ground about three feet deep as far as you could walk in a day in any direction.

32. All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered the quails. No one gathered less than sixty bushels. Then they spread the quails out all around the camp.

33. While the meat was still in their mouths, before they had even had a chance to chew it, Jehovah became angry with the people and struck them with a severe plague.

34. That place was called Kibroth Hattaavah Graves of Those Who Craved Meat because they buried the people who had a strong craving for meat there.

35. From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth, where they stayed.

## Numbers 12

1. Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because he was married to a Cushite woman from Sudan.

2. They asked: »Did Jehovah speak only through Moses? Did he not also speak through us? Jehovah heard their complaint.

3. Moses was a very humble meek man. He was more humble than anyone else on earth.

4. Suddenly, Jehovah said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam: »All three of you come to the tent of meeting.« So all three of them went to the tent.

5. Then Jehovah came down in the column of smoke and stood at the entrance to the tent. He called to Aaron and Miriam. They both came forward.

6. He said: »Listen to my words: When there are prophets of Jehovah among you, I make myself known to them in visions or speak to them in dreams.

7. »But this is not the way I treat my servant Moses. He is the most faithful person in my household.

8. »I speak with him face to face. I speak plainly and not in riddles. He even sees the form of Jehovah. Why were you not afraid to criticize my servant Moses?«

9. Jehovah was angry with them, so he left.

10. After the smoke left the tent, Miriam was covered with an infectious skin disease. She was as white as snow. Aaron turned to her and saw she was covered with the disease.

11. He said to Moses: »Please, do not make us suffer this punishment for our foolish sin.

12. »Do not let her become like something born dead with half its flesh eaten away.«

13. Therefore Moses cried out to Jehovah: »O God, heal her!«

14. Jehovah answered: »If her father had spit in her face, she would have to bear her disgrace for seven days. So let her be shut out of the camp for a week, and after that she can be brought back in.«

15. Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days. The people did not move on until she was brought back in.

16. Then they left Hazeroth and set up camp in the wilderness of Paran.

## Numbers 13

1. Jehovah said to Moses:

2. »Choose one of the leaders from each of the twelve tribes and send them as spies to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites.«

3. According to Jehovahs command, Moses sent these men from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.

4. These are their names: Shammua, son of Zaccur, from the tribe of Reuben,

5. Shaphat, son of Hori, from the tribe of Simeon;

6. Caleb, son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;

7. Igal, son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar;

8. Hoshea, son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim;

9. Palti, son of Raphu, from the tribe of Benjamin;

10. Gaddiel, son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulun;

11. Gaddi, son of Susi, from the tribe of Joseph, that is, the tribe of Manasseh;

12. Ammiel, son of Gemalli, from the tribe of Dan;

13. Sethur, son of Michael, from the tribe of Asher;

14. Nahbi, son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali;

15. and Geuel, son of Machi, from the tribe of Gad.

16. These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. But Moses gave Hoshea, son of Nun, the name Joshua.

17. When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he told them: »Go through the Negev and then into the mountain region.

18. »See what the land is like and whether the people there are strong or weak, few or many.

19. »Is the land they live in good or bad? Do their cities have walls around them or not?

20. »Is the soil rich or poor? Does the land have trees or not? Do your best to bring back some fruit from the land.« It was the season when grapes were beginning to ripen.

21. So they spied on the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath.

22. When they went to the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.

23. At Eshcol Valley they cut off a branch with only one bunch of grapes on it. They carried it on a pole between two of them. They also brought some pomegranates and figs.

24. So they called that valley Eshcol Bunch of Grapes because of the bunch of grapes the Israelites cut off there.

25. Forty days later they returned from exploring the land.

26. They returned to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. They gave their report and showed them the fruit from the land.

27. This is their report to Moses: »We went to the land where you sent us. It really is a land flowing with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit.

28. »The people who live there are strong. The cities have walls and are very large. We even saw the descendants of Anak there.

29. »The Amalekites live in the Negev. The Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the mountain region. The Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and all along the Jordan River.«

30. Caleb told the people to be quiet and listen to Moses. Caleb said: »Let us go now and take possession of the land. We should be more than able to conquer it.«

31. The men who had gone with him said: »We cannot attack those people! They are too strong for us!

32. »They spread lies among the Israelites about the land they had explored. They said: The land we explored is one that devours those who live there. All the people we saw there are very tall.

33. »We saw Nephilim there. The descendants of Anak are Nephilim. We felt as small as grasshoppers. That is no doubt how we must have looked to them.«

## Numbers 14

1. All the Israelite congregation raised their voices and cried out loud all that night.

2. They complained to Moses and Aaron: »If only we had died in Egypt or in this desert!

3. »Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land? Is it just to have us die in battle? Our wives and children will be taken as prisoners of war! Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?«

4. They said to each other: »Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt.«

5. Immediately, Moses and Aaron bowed with their faces touching the ground in front of the whole congregation of Israel assembled there.

6. At the same time, two of those who had explored the land, Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, tore their clothes in despair.

7. They said to the entire congregation of Israel: »The land we explored is very good.

8. »If Jehovah is pleased with us, he will take us there and give us that rich and fertile land.

9. »Do not rebel against Jehovah. Do not be afraid of the people who live there. We will conquer them easily. Jehovah is with us and has defeated the gods who protected them. Do not be afraid.«

10. The whole congregation threatened to stone them to death. Then suddenly the people saw the dazzling light of Jehovahs presence glorysplendor appear over the tent.

11. Jehovah said to Moses: »How much longer will these people reject me? How much longer will they refuse to trust in me, even though I have performed many miracles among them?

12. »I will send an epidemic and destroy them. I will make you the father of a nation that is larger and more powerful than they are!«

13. Moses said to Jehovah: »You brought these people out of Egypt by your power. When the Egyptians hear what you have done to your people,

14. they will tell it to the people who live in this land. These people have already heard that you, Jehovah, are with us, that you appear in plain sight when your cloud stops over us, and that you go before us in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.

15. »But if you kill all these people at the same time the nations who have heard these reports about you will say,

16. »Jehovah was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them, so he slaughtered them in the desert.

17. »Jehovah, let your power be as great as when you said,

18. »Jehovah is patient, forever loving; He forgives wrongdoing and disobedience. He never lets the guilty go unpunished. In fact he punishes children for their parents sins to the third and fourth generation.

19. »By your great love, please forgive these peoples sins, as you have forgiven them from the time they left Egypt until now.«

20. Jehovah said: »I forgive them, as you have asked.

21. »But as I live and as the glory of Jehovah fills the whole earth, I solemnly swear that

22. none of the people who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I did in Egypt and in the desert will see the land I promised their ancestors. They have tested me now ten times and refused to obey me.

23. »None of those who treat me with contempt will see it!

24. »My servant Caleb has a different attitude and has wholeheartedly followed me, I will bring him to the land he already explored. His descendants will possess it.

25. »The Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys. Tomorrow you must turn around, go back into the desert. Follow the road that goes to the Red Sea.«

26. Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:

27. »How long must I put up with this wicked congregation that keeps complaining about me? I have heard the complaints the Israelites are making about me.

28. »Therefore tell them: As I live, declares Jehovah, I solemnly swear I will do everything to you that you said I would do.

29. »Your bodies will drop dead in this desert. All of you who are at least twenty years old, who were registered and listed, and who complained about me will die.

30. »I raised my hand and swore an oath to give you this land to live in. But none of you will enter it except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.

31. »You said your children would be taken as prisoners of war. Instead, I will bring them into the land you rejected, and they will enjoy it.

32. »But your bodies will drop dead in this desert.

33. »Your children will be shepherds in the desert for forty years. They will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies dead in the desert.

34. »You explored the land for forty days. So for forty years, one year for each day, you will suffer for your sins and know what it means for me to be against you.

35. »I, Jehovah, have spoken. I swear I will do these things to all the people in this whole wicked congregation. For they have joined forces against me. They will meet their end in this desert. Here they will die!«

36. The men Moses sent to explore the land died in front of Jehovah from a plague.

37. They died because they had returned and made the whole community complain about Moses. They spread lies about the land.

38. Of all the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.

39. Moses told these things to all the Israelites. The people mourned bitterly, as if someone had died.

40. Early the next morning they headed into the mountains. They said: »We have sinned. Now we will go to the place Jehovah promised.«

41. Moses asked: »Why are you disobeying Jehovahs command? Your plan will not work!

42. »Do not go! Your enemies will defeat you because Jehovah is not with you.

43. »The Amalekites and Canaanites are there. You will die in battle. Now that you have turned away from Jehovah, he will not be with you.«

44. But they headed into the mountains anyway. The Ark of the Jehovahs promise and Moses stayed in the camp.

45. The Amalekites and Canaanites who lived there came down from those mountains, attacked the Israelites, and defeated them at Hormah.

## Numbers 15

1. Jehovah said to Moses:

2. Speak to the Israelites and tell them: »Once you are settled in the land I am giving you,

3. you must bring offerings by fire to Jehovah. They may be burnt offerings or any other kind of sacrifice. They may be offered to fulfill a vow, as a freewill offering, or as one of your festival offerings. They may be cattle, sheep, or goats. These are offerings that are a soothing pleasantrestful aroma to Jehovah.

4. »Whoever presents the offering must also give Jehovah a grain offering of eight cups of flour mixed with one quart of oil.

5. »With each sheep or goat for the burnt offering or any other sacrifice, also give an offering of one quart of wine.

6. »With a ram, give a grain offering of sixteen cups of flour mixed with one and one quarter quarts of oil

7. and an offering of one and one quarter quarts of wine. Offer them as a soothing aroma to Jehovah.

8. »When you sacrifice a young bull as a burnt offering to Jehovah or make any other kind of sacrifice to keep a vow or as a fellowship offering.

9. »Offer with the young bull a grain offering of twenty-four cups of flour mixed with two quarts of oil.

10. »Also give an offering of two quarts of wine. It is an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.

11. »Do this for each bull, each ram, and each sheep or goat.

12. »Do it for each animal, however many you sacrifice.

13. »All native-born Israelites must do it this way when they bring an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.

14. »Make a food offering, an odor that pleases Jehovah. If foreigners live among you, whether on a temporary or a permanent basis, they are to observe the same regulations.

15. »For all time to come, the same rules are binding on you and on the foreigners who live among you. You and they are alike in Jehovahs sight.

16. »The same laws and regulations apply to you and to them.«

17. Jehovah gave Moses

18. the following regulations for the people of Israel. They are to observe them in the land he was going to give them.

19. »When any food produced there is eaten, some of it is to be set aside as a special contribution to Jehovah.

20. »When you bake bread, the first loaf of the first bread made from the new grain is to be presented as a special contribution to Jehovah. This is to be presented in the same way as the special contribution you make from the grain you thresh.

21. »For all time to come, this special gift is to be given to Jehovah from the bread you bake.

22. »Suppose someone unintentionally fails to keep some of these regulations Jehovah gave Moses.

23. »Also suppose that in the future the congregation fails to do everything Jehovah commanded through Moses.

24. »If the mistake was made because of the ignorance of the congregation, they are to offer a bull as a burnt offering, an odor that pleases Jehovah. Use the proper grain offering and wine offering. In addition, they are to offer a male goat as a sin offering.

25. »The priest will perform the ritual of purification for the congregation. They will be forgiven since the mistake was unintentional and they brought their sin offering as a food offering to Jehovah

26. »The whole congregation of Israel and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven, because everyone was involved in the mistake.

27. »If any of you sin unintentionally, you should offer a one-year-old female goat as a sin offering.

28. »The priest shall perform the ritual of purification at the altar to purify you from your sin. You will be forgiven.

29. »The same regulation applies to all who unintentionally commit a sin, whether they are native Israelites or resident foreigners.

30. »Any who sin deliberately, natives or foreigners, are guilty of treating Jehovah with contempt. They shall be put to death.

31. »They have rejected what Jehovah said and have deliberately broken one of his commandments. They are responsible for their own death.«

32. One time, while the Israelites were still in the wilderness, a man was found gathering firewood on the Sabbath.

33. He was taken to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation.

34. They held him in custody until they decided what to do with him.

35. Jehovah said to Moses: »This man must be put to death. The whole congregation must take him outside the camp and stone him.«

36. So the whole congregation took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

37. Jehovah said to Moses:

38. Speak to the Israelites and tell them: »For generations to come they must wear tassels on the corners of their clothes. Each tassel should have violet threads.

39. »When you look at the threads in the tassel, you will remember all Jehovahs commandments and obey them. Then you will not do whatever you want and go after whatever you see, as if you were chasing after prostitutes.

40. »You will remember to obey all my commandments. You will be holy to your God.

41. »I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am Jehovah your God!«

## Numbers 16

1. Korah son of Izhar, Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth dared to challenge Moses. Korah was a descendant of Kohath and Levi. Dathan, Abiram, and On were descendants of Reuben.

2. These four men were joined by two hundred and fifty Israelite men, well known leaders of the congregation. The assembly chose them.

3. They came together to confront Moses and Aaron. They said: »You have gone far enough! Everyone in the whole congregation is holy. Jehovah is among them. Why do you set yourselves above Jehovahs assembly?«

4. When Moses heard this, he bowed with his face touching the ground.

5. Then he said to Korah and all his followers: »In the morning Jehovah will show who belongs to him, who is holy. He will have that person come near him. Only the person Jehovah chooses will be allowed to come near him.

6. »Korah, you and all your followers must do this tomorrow: Take incense burners,

7. »Put burning coals and incense in them in Jehovahs presence. Jehovah will choose the man who is holy. You have gone far enough!«

8. Moses also said to Korah: »Listen, you sons of Levi!

9. »Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel? Jehovah has brought you near to do the work for his tent and stand in front of the community to serve them.

10. »He brought you and all the other Levites near. But now you demand to be priests.

11. »You and all your followers have joined forces against Jehovah! Who is Aaron that you should complain about him?«

12. Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab. But they said: »We will not come!

13. »Is it not enough that you brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey only to kill us in the desert? Do you also have to order us around?

14. »You have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us any fields and vineyards to own. Do you think you can still pull the wool over our eyes? We will not come.«

15. Moses became angry and said to Jehovah: »Do not accept their offering. I have not taken anything from them, not even a donkey. And I have not mistreated any of them.«

16. Moses said to Korah: »Tomorrow you and all your followers must come into Jehovahs presence. Aaron will also be there with you.

17. »Each man will take his incense burner and put incense in it. They will offer all two hundred and fifty incense burners to Jehovah. Then you and Aaron offer your incense burners.«

18. So each man took his incense burner. He put burning coals and incense in it and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

19. Korah assembled all his followers who opposed Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting. The glory of Jehovah appeared to the entire group.

20. Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:

21. »Move away from these men. I will destroy them instantly.«

22. Immediately, they bowed with their faces touching the ground and said: »O God, you are the God who gives the breath of life to everyone! If one man sins, will you be angry with the entire congregation?«

23. Then Jehovah said to Moses:

24. »Tell the congregation: Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.«

25. Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.

26. He said to the congregation: »Move away from the tents of these wicked men. Do not touch anything that belongs to them, or youll be swept away because of all their sins.«

27. So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came out and were standing at the entrances to their tents with their wives and children.

28. Moses said: »This is how you will know that Jehovah sent me to do all these things and that it wasnt my idea:

29. »If these men die a natural death like all other people Jehovah has not sent me.

30. »But if Jehovah does something totally new, if the ground opens up, swallows them and everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive to their graves; then you will know that these men have treated Jehovah with contempt.«

31. When he finished speaking, the ground under them split,

32. and the earth opened up to swallow them, their families, the followers of Korah, and all their property.

33. They went down alive to their graves with everything that belonged to them. The ground covered them. They disappeared from the assembly.

34. All the Israelites around them ran away when they heard their screams. They thought the ground would swallow them, also.

35. Fire came from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.

36. Then Jehovah said to Moses:

37. »Tell Eleazar, son of the priest Aaron, to take the incense burners out of the fire and scatter the coals and incense somewhere else. This is because the incense burners have become holy.

38. »The incense burners of these men who sinned and lost their lives are holy, because they were offered to Jehovah. Hammer them into thin metal sheets to cover the altar. This will be a sign to the Israelites.«

39. The priest Eleazar took the copper incense burners that had been brought by those who had been burned to death. The incense burners were then hammered into thin metal sheets to cover the altar.

40. He followed Jehovahs command given through Moses. The copper-covered altar will remind Israel that no one but a descendant of Aaron may come near to burn incense to Jehovah. Everyone else will die like Korah and his followers.

41. The next day the whole congregation of Israel complained to Moses and Aaron. They said: »You have killed Jehovahs people.«

42. The congregation came together to confront Moses and Aaron. When they turned toward the tent of meeting, they saw the smoke covering it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.

43. Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting.

44. Jehovah said to Moses:

45. »Get away from these people, and let me destroy them in an instant! Immediately, they bowed with their faces touching the ground.«

46. Moses said to Aaron: »Take your incense burner, put burning coals from the altar and incense in it, and go quickly into the congregation to make peace with Jehovah for the people. Jehovah shows his anger! A plague has started.«

47. Aaron took his incense burner, as Moses told him. He ran into the middle of the assembly, because the plague had already begun among the people. He put incense on the incense burner to make peace with Jehovah for the people.

48. He stood between those who had died and those who were still alive. The plague stopped.

49. Fourteen thousand seven hundred died from the plague in addition to those who died because of Korah.

50. By the time Aaron came back to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the plague had stopped.

## Numbers 17

1. Jehovah said to Moses:

2. »Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them. Get one from the leader of each of their tribes. Write each mans name on his staff.

3. »Write Aarons name on the staff for Levi because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe.

4. »Put them in the tent of meeting where I meet with you, in front of the testimony of my promise.

5. »The staff from the man I choose will begin to grow. In this way I will silence the frequent complaints the Israelites make against you and Aaron.«

6. Thus Moses spoke to the Israelites. Their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one from the leader of each of their tribes. Aarons staff was among them.

7. Moses put the staffs in Jehovahs presence in the tent of the testimony.

8. The next day Moses went into the tent. He found that Aarons staff for the tribe of Levi had not only begun to grow, but it had also blossomed and produced ripe almonds.

9. Moses brought out the staffs from Jehovahs presence and showed them to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his staff.

10. Jehovah said to Moses: »Put Aarons staff in front of the testimony. Keep it there as a sign to warn any other rebels. Then you will stop their complaints about me, and they will not die.«

11. Moses did exactly what Jehovah commanded him to do.

12. The Israelites said to Moses: Now we are going to die! We will perish! We are all lost!

13. Anyone who comes near Jehovahs tent will die! Are we all going to die?

## Numbers 18

1. Jehovah said to Aaron: »You, your sons, and your family will be responsible for any sins against the holy place. You and your sons will also be responsible for any sins you commit when you work as priests.

2. »Bring the other Levites from your ancestors tribe to join you and help you and your sons serve in front of the tent of the words of my promise.

3. »They are to fulfill their duties to you and their responsibilities for the tent. However they must not have any contact with sacred objects in the Holy Place or with the altar. If they do, both they and you will be put to death.

4. »They are to work with you and fulfill their responsibilities for all the service in the tent. No unqualified person may work with you.

5. »You and your sons alone must fulfill the responsibilities for the Holy Place and the altar. That way my anger will not again break out against the people of Israel.

6. »I chose the other Levites from among the Israelites to help you. They are a gift given to Jehovah to do the necessary work at the tent of meeting.

7. »Only you and your sons may do the work of priests, everything done at the altar and under the canopy. This is my gift to you: You may serve me as priests. Anyone else who comes near the holy place to do this work must die.«

8. Jehovah said to Aaron: »I have placed you in charge of all the contributions given to me. I have given you and your descendants all the holy gifts from the Israelites as your share. These contributions will be yours from generation to generation.

9. »That part of the most holy offerings that is not burned belongs to you. It may come from a grain offering, an offering for sin, or a guilt offering. Whatever is brought to me, as a most holy offering will belong to you and your sons.

10. »Eat it in a most holy place. Any male may eat it. You must consider it holy.

11. »The contributions that come as gifts taken from the offerings presented by the Israelites are also yours. I give these to you, your sons, and your daughters. They will be yours from generation to generation. Anyone in your household who is clean may eat them.

12. »I also give you the first of the produce they give Jehovah. It is the best of all the olive oil and the best of the new wine and fresh grain.

13. »The first of all produce harvested in their land that they bring to Jehovah are yours. Anyone in your household who is clean may eat it.

14. »Anything in Israel that is claimed by Jehovah is yours.

15. »Every firstborn male, human or animal that is brought to Jehovah is yours. But you must buy back every firstborn son and the firstborn male of any unclean animal.

16. »When they are one month old, you must buy them back at the fixed price of two ounces of silver using the standard weight of the holy place.

17. »You must never buy back a firstborn bull, sheep, or goat. They are holy. Throw the blood from these animals against the altar. Burn the fat as an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.

18. »The meat is yours, like the breast and the right thigh that are presented.

19. »I have given you, your sons, and your daughters all the holy contributions which the Israelites offer to Jehovah. These contributions will be yours from generation to generation. It is an everlasting promise of salt in Jehovahs presence for you and your descendants.«

20. Jehovah said to Aaron: »You will have no land or property of your own as the other Israelites will have. I am your possession and your property among the Israelites.

21. »I have given the Levites one-tenth of every Israelites income. This is in return for the work they do at the tent of meeting.

22. »The other Israelites must never again come near the tent of meeting. Otherwise, they will suffer the consequences of their sin and die.

23. »Only the Levites will do the work at the tent of meeting. They are responsible for their own sins. This is a long lasting law for future generations. They will own no property, as the other Israelites will.

24. »Instead, I will give the Levites what the Israelites contribute to Jehovah, one-tenth of the Israelites income. This is why I said about them: They will own no property as the other Israelites do.«

25. Jehovah said to Moses:

26. »Speak to the Levites and say to them: You will take one-tenth of the Israelites income that I am giving you as your property. When you do, you must contribute one-tenth of that income as your contribution to Jehovah.

27. »Your contribution will be considered to be grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.

28. »You will also contribute one-tenth of your income to Jehovah out of all that you receive from the Israelites income. You will give Jehovahs contribution to the priest Aaron.

29. »Out of all the gifts you receive, you must contribute the best and holiest parts to Jehovah.

30. »Also tell them: When you contribute the best part, your contribution will be considered to be produce from the threshing floor or winepress.

31. »You and your households may eat it anywhere. This is because it is the wages you receive for your work at the tent of meeting.

32. »When you contribute the best part, you will not suffer the consequences of any sin. You will not be dishonoring the holy offerings given by the Israelites, and you will not die.«

## Numbers 19

1. Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:

2. »This is a requirement of the law Jehovah has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red cow that is perfect, with no defects. Also, it must never have worn a yoke.

3. »Give it to Eleazar the priest. It must be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.

4. »Eleazar the priest will take some of the blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.

5. »Then the entire cow, the skin, meat, blood, and excrement, will be burned while he watches.

6. »The priest will take some cedar wood, a hyssop sprig, and some red yarn and throw them onto the burning cow.

7. »The priest must then wash his clothes and his body. After that, he may go into the camp. But he will be unclean until evening.

8. »The person who burned the calf must also wash his clothes and his body. He will be unclean until evening.

9. »A man who is clean will collect the ashes from the cow and put them in a clean place outside the camp. They will be kept by the congregation of Israel and used in the water that takes away uncleanness. The cow is an offering for sin.

10. »The one who collected the ashes must wash his clothes. He remains unclean until evening. This regulation is valid for all time to come, both for the Israelites and for the foreigners living among them.

11. »Those who touch a corpse are ritually unclean for seven days.

12. »They must purify themselves with the water for purification on the third day and on the seventh day. Then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on both the third and the seventh day, they will not be clean.

13. »Those who touch a corpse and do not purify themselves remain unclean. This is because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile Jehovahs tent, and they will no longer be considered Gods people.

14. »Here are your instructions for when a person dies in a tent: Everyone who goes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent will be unclean for seven days.

15. »Every container without a lid fastened on it is unclean.

16. »Whoever is outdoors and touches someone who was killed or has died naturally or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave will be unclean for seven days.

17. »Do this for people who become unclean from touching a dead body. Put some of the ashes from the red cow that was burned as an offering for sin into a container. Then pour fresh water on them.

18. »A person who is clean will take a sprig of hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and all the people who were in the tent with the dead body. He must also sprinkle any person who has touched a human bone or a grave and any person who has touched someone who has been killed or who has died naturally.

19. »A person who is clean will sprinkle these types of unclean people on the third day and the seventh day. On the seventh day the clean person will finish taking away their sins. Then they must wash their clothes and bodies. In the evening they will be clean.

20. »If the person who becomes unclean does not have his sin taken away, that person must be excluded from the assembly. He has made the holy place of Jehovah unclean. The water to take away uncleanness was not sprinkled on him. He is unclean.

21. »This will be a long lasting law for them. He who sprinkles the water to take away uncleanness must wash his clothes. He who touches this water will be unclean until evening.

22. »Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean. The person who touches it will be unclean until evening.«

## Numbers 20

1. In the first month the whole congregation of Israel came into the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.

2. The congregation was without water. So they gathered to confront Moses and Aaron.

3. The people complained to Moses. They said: »If only we had died when the other Israelites died in Jehovahs presence!

4. »Did you bring Jehovahs assembly into this desert just to have us all die and our animals?

5. »Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us into this terrible place? This is no place to plant crops. Even figs, grapes, and pomegranates will not grow here. And there is no water to drink!«

6. Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting. They bowed with their faces touching the ground. The glory of Jehovah appeared to them.

7. Jehovah said to Moses:

8. »Take your staff and you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation. Right before their eyes, tell the rock to give up its water. In this way you will give the congregation water from the rock for them and their animals to drink.«

9. Moses took his staff out of the tent in Jehovahs presence as he had been commanded.

10. Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation in front of the rock and said to them: »Listen, you rebels, must we bring water out of this rock for you?«

11. Moses raised his hand and hit the rock twice with the staff. Water came pouring out! All the people and their animals drank.

12. Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: »You did not trust me! You did not show the Israelites how holy I am! So you will not bring this congregation into the land I am giving them.«

13. This was the oasis of Meribah Complaining, where the Israelites complained about Jehovah and where he showed them he was holy.

14. Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. He said: »This is what your brother Israel says: You know all the hardships we have had.

15. »Our ancestors went to Egypt. We lived there for many years. The Egyptians mistreated our ancestors and us.

16. »We cried to Jehovah for help. He heard our cry and sent an angel, who led us out of Egypt. Now we are at Kadesh, a town at the border of your territory.

17. »Please permit us to pass through your land. We, including our cattle, will not leave the road or go into your fields or vineyards. We will not drink from your wells. We will stay on the main kings road until we are out of your territory.«

18. But the Edomites answered: »We refuse to let you pass through our country! If you try, we will march out and attack you.«

19. The people of Israel said: »We will stay on the main road. If we, or our animals, drink any of your water we will pay for it. All we want is to pass through.«

20. The Edomites repeated: »We refuse!« Then they marched out with a powerful army to attack the people of Israel.

21. The Edomites would not let the Israelites pass through their territory. So the Israelites turned and went another way.

22. The whole congregation of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor,

23. on the border of Edom. There Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:

24. »Aaron is not going to enter the land I promised to give to Israel. He is going to die, because the two of you rebelled against my command at Meribah.

25. »Take Aaron and his son Eleazar to Mount Hor.

26. »Remove Aarons priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. Aaron is going to die there.«

27. Moses did what Jehovah commanded. They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the entire congregation.

28. Moses removed Aarons priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. There on the top of the mountain Aaron died, and Moses and Eleazar came back down.

29. The entire congregation learned that Aaron had died. They all mourned for him for thirty days.

## Numbers 21

1. The Canaanite king of Arad in the southern part of Canaan heard that the Israelites were coming by way of Atharim. So he attacked them and captured some of them.

2. Then the Israelites made a vow to Jehovah: »If you will let us conquer these people, we will unconditionally dedicate them and their cities to you and will destroy them.«

3. Jehovah heard them and helped them conquer the Canaanites. The Israelites completely destroyed them and their cities, and named the place Hormah.

4. They moved from Mount Hor following the road that goes to the Red Sea. That way they could go around Edom. The people became impatient on the trip

5. and criticized God and Moses. They said: »Why did you make us leave Egypt only to let us die in the desert? There is no bread or water, and we cannot stand this awful food!«

6. Jehovah sent poisonous snakes among the people. They bit the people, and many of the Israelites died.

7. The people came to Moses and said: »We sinned when we criticized Jehovah and you. Pray to Jehovah so that he will take the snakes away from us. So Moses prayed for the people.«

8. Jehovah said to Moses: »Make a snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.«

9. Moses made a copper snake and put it on a pole. People looked at the copper snake after they were bitten and lived.

10. The Israelites moved and set up camp at Oboth.

11. After leaving that place, they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory.

12. Then they camped in Zered Valley.

13. They moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River, in the desert that extends into Amorite territory. The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.

14. That is why The Book of Jehovahs Battles speaks of the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the valleys; the Arnon River,

15. and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border of Moab.

16. From there they went on to a place called Wells, where Jehovah said to Moses: Bring the people together, and I will give them water.

17. The people of Israel sang this song: »Wells, produce your water; And we will greet it with a song.

18. »The well dug by princes and by leaders of the people, dug with a royal scepter and with their walking sticks. They moved from the wilderness to Mattanah,

19. and from there they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,

20. and from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of the Moabites, below the top of Mount Pisgah, looking out over the desert.

21. »The people of Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon to say:

22. »Let us go through your country. We will not go through any of your fields or vineyards or drink any of the water from your wells. We will stay on the kings highway until we have passed through your territory.«

23. Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his troops and came out into the desert to attack Israel. When Sihons troops came to Jahaz, they fought against Israel.

24. Israel defeated them in battle and took possession of their land from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River. They stopped at the border of the Ammon because it was fortified.

25. The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns. They settled in the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages.

26. King Sihon ruled from Heshbon after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon River gorge.

27. That is why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon: »Come and rebuild Heshbon, King Sihons capital city!

28. »His armies marched out like fiery flames, burning down the town of Ar and destroying the hills along the Arnon River.

29. »You Moabites are done for! Your god Chemosh deserted your people. They were captured, taken away by King Sihon the Amorite.

30. »We completely defeated Moab. The towns of Heshbon and Dibon, of Nophah and Medeba are ruined and gone.«

31. After the Israelites settled in the Amorite territory,

32. Moses sent some men to explore the town of Jazer. Some time later, the Israelites captured the villages surrounding it and forced out the Amorites who lived there.

33. They turned around and went by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people for battle at Edrei.

34. Jehovah said to Moses: »Do not fear him for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land. You will do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.«

35. The Israelites defeated him, his sons, and all his troops, leaving no survivors. They took possession of his land.

## Numbers 22

1. The Israelites moved and set up camp across from Jericho. They were on the plains of Moab east of the Jordan River.

2. Balak, son of Zippor, saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

3. The Moabites were very afraid because there were so many Israelites. Also, the Moabites did not like these people.

4. So the Moabites said to the leaders of Midian: »All those people will eventually eat up everything around us the same way cattle eat up the grass in a field. At that time Balak, son of Zippor, was king of Moab.«

5. He sent messengers to summon Balaam, son of Beor, who was at Pethor, on the Euphrates River, in the land where his people lived. Balaks message was: »A nation has just come here from Egypt. They have spread out all over the countryside and are setting up their camp here in front of me.

6. »They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then maybe we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that when you pronounce a blessing, people are blessed, and when you pronounce a curse, they are placed under a curse.«

7. The elders of Moab and Midian left. They took money with them to pay for Balaams services. They came to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.

8. »Spend the night here,« Balaam said to them, »and I will report to you what Jehovah tells me.« So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.

9. God came to Balaam and asked: »Who are these men with you?«

10. Balaam answered: »Balak, son of King Zippor of Moab, sent them with this message:

11. »Some people came from Egypt and are spreading out all over the countryside. Now come and curse them for me. Maybe I will be able to fight them and force them out.«

12. God said to Balaam: »Do not go with them! Do not curse these people. They are blessed!«

13. When Balaam got up in the morning, he said to Balaks princes: »Go back to your own country. Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.«

14. The Moabite princes went back to Balak and said: »Balaam refused to come with us.«

15. Balak sent a larger group of more highly respected princes.

16. When they came to Balaam they said to him: »This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me.

17. »I will make sure you are richly rewarded. I will do whatever you ask. Please, come and curse execrate these people for me.«

18. Balaam answered Balaks servants: »Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not disobey the command of Jehovah my God no matter whether the request was important or not.

19. »Now, please stay here tonight, as the others did, and I will find out what else Jehovah may have to tell me.«

20. That night God came to Balaam and said: »If these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.«

21. Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and left with the Moabite princes.

22. God became angry that he was going. So the angel of Jehovah stood in the road to stop him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants.

23. The donkey saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the road with his sword drawn. The donkey turned off the road into a field. Balaam hit the donkey to get it back on the road.

24. Where the road went through the vineyards, it was narrow, with stonewalls on both sides. Now the angel of Jehovah stood there.

25. The donkey saw the angel and it moved over against the wall and crushed Balaams foot against it. Again Balaam beat the donkey.

26. Once more the angel moved ahead. He stood in a narrow place where there was no room at all to pass on either side.

27. This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down. Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick.

28. Jehovah gave the donkey the power of speech. The donkey said to Balaam: »What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times?«

29. Balaam answered: »It is because you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you.«

30. The donkey replied: »Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?« »No,« he answered.

31. Then Jehovah let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword. Balaam threw himself face down on the ground.

32. The angel demanded: »Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey.

33. »But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it had not, I would have killed you and spared the donkey.«

34. Balaam replied: »I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you think it is wrong for me to go on I will return home.«

35. But the angel said: »Go on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say.« Thus Balaam went on with them.

36. Balak heard that Balaam was coming. He went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab.

37. Balak said to him: »Why did you not come when I sent for you the first time? Did you think I was not able to reward you enough?«

38. Balaam answered: »I am here now. But now, what power do I have? I can say only what God tells me to say.«

39. Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth.

40. Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.

41. The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel.

## Numbers 23

1. He said to Balak: »Build seven altars here for me. Then bring me seven bulls and seven rams.«

2. Balak did as he was told. He and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

3. Then Balaam said to Balak: »Stand here by your burnt offering. I will go to see whether or not Jehovah will meet me. I will tell you what he reveals to me.« So he went alone to the top of a hill.

4. God met him and Balaam said to God: »I have built the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.«

5. Jehovah told Balaam: »Go back to Balak and give him my message.«

6. He went back to Balak and found him standing beside his burnt offering with all the princes of Moab.

7. Balaam delivered this message: »Balak brought me from Aram. The king of Moab summoned me from the eastern mountains. Come and curse Jacob for me,« he said. Come and condemn Israel.

8. »How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I condemn those whom Jehovah has not condemned?

9. »I see them from the top of rocky cliffs. I look at them from the hills. I see a nation that lives by itself! These are people who do not consider themselves to be like other nations.

10. »The descendants of Jacob are like specks of dust. Who can count them or number even one-fourth of the people of Israel? Let me die the death of innocent people. Let my end be like theirs.«

11. Balak responded to Balaam: »What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but all you have done is bless them!«

12. Balaam answered: »I must say what Jehovah tells me to say.«

13. Balak said: »Please come with me to another place, where you can see the Israelites. You will see only some of them, not all of them. Curse them for me from there.«

14. So he took him to the Field of Zophim on top of Mount Pisgah. He built seven altars there. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

15. Then Balaam said to Balak: »Stay here beside your burnt offering while I meet with God over there.«

16. Jehovah met Balaam and told him what to say. He sent him back to Balak to give him his message.

17. So he returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering. He was with the leaders of Moab. Balak asked what Jehovah said.

18. Balaam uttered this prophecy: »Come, Balak son of Zippor, and listen to what I have to say.

19. »God is a not man that he should lie. He is not a son of man who changes his mind. Does he ever promise and not fulfill? Does he ever speak and not act?

20. »I have been instructed to bless. And when God blesses, I cannot call it back.

21. »He has not observed wickedness in Jacob. Nor has he seen trouble in Israel! Jehovah his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them.

22. »God brings them out of Egypt. He is for them like the horns of the wild bull.

23. »For there is omen spell against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel. At the proper time it will be said to Jacob and Israel: What God has done!

24. »Behold, the nation of Israel! It is like a mighty lion: It will rise and not lie down again until it has torn and devoured its pray. It will drink the blood of those it has killed.«

25. Balak said to Balaam: »You refuse to curse malign the people of Israel, but at least do not bless them!«

26. Balaam answered: »Did I not tell you that I must do everything Jehovah tells me?«

27. Balak replied: »Come with me. I will take you to another place. Perhaps God will be willing to let you curse them for me from there.«

28. So he took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor overlooking the desert.

29. Balaam said to him: »Build seven altars for me here and bring me seven bulls and seven rams.«

30. Balak did as he was told. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

## Numbers 24

1. Balaam knew that Jehovah wanted him to bless the people of Israel. So he did not go to look for omens, as he had done before. He turned toward the desert.

2. There he saw the people of Israel camped tribe by tribe. The Spirit of God took control of him.

3. He uttered this prophecy: The message of Balaam son of Beor. These are the words of the man who can see clearly.

4. The oracle of him who hears the words of God and who sees the vision of the Almighty. Falling down, yet having his eyes open.

5. How good are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel!

6. »They are like valleys that stretch out, like gardens beside the river, like aloes planted by Jehovah, like cedars beside the waters.

7. »Water will flow from his buckets and his seed will be by many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. And his kingdom shall be exalted.

8. »God brings him out of Egypt. He is for him like the horns of the wild bull. He will devour the nations who are his adversaries. He will crush their bones in pieces and shatter them with his arrows.

9. »He bows down and he lies down like a lion. Like a lion, who dares rouse him? Blessed is everyone who blesses you! Cursed is everyone who curses you!«

10. Balaks anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and Balak said to Balaam: I called you to curse my enemies! But you have persisted in blessing them three times!

11. Therefore, run away to your place now. I said: »I will honor you greatly, but Jehovah has held you back from honor.«

12. Balaam replied to Balak: »Did I not tell the messengers whom you sent to me:

13. »Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything contrary to the command of Jehovah either good or bad, of my own accord. What Jehovah speaks, that I will speak!

14. »Now I am going to my people. Come along and I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the days to come.«

15. He began his discourse by saying: »The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor. The oracle of the man, whose eye is opened,

16. »The oracle of him who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and sees the vision of the Almighty. Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered.

17. »I see him, but not now! I behold him, but not near! A star shall come forth from Jacob. A scepter shall rise from Israel and shall crush through the forehead of Moab. It will tear down all the sons of Sheth.

18. »Edom shall be a possession. Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession. This while Israel performs valiantly.

19. »One from Jacob will have dominion and will destroy the remnant from the city.«

20. He looked at Amalek and continued his discourse. He said: Amalek was the first of the nations but he will end in destruction.

21. And he looked at the Kenite and continued his discourse. He said: »Your dwelling place is enduring and your nest is set in the cliff.

22. »Nevertheless Kain will be consumed! How long will Asshur keep you captive?«

23. He again offered his discourse and said: »Alas, who can live except God ordain it?

24. »Ships will come from the coast of Kittim. They will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber. They will also come to destruction.«

25. Balaam got up and went back home. Balak also went his way.

## Numbers 25

1. While Israel remained at Shittim, the people indulged in sexual immorality with the Moabite women.

2. The Moabites invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods.

3. So Israel joined itself to Baal of Peor. Jehovah was angry against Israel.

4. Jehovah said to Moses: »Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before Jehovah so that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.«

5. Moses said to the judges of Israel: »Each of you put to death those men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.«

6. One of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman to his brothers. He did this right in front of Moses and the entire congregation of Israel while they were crying at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

7. Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron, saw this. He left the assembly and grabbed a spear in his hand.

8. He went into the tent after the Israelite man. He drove the spear through the man and into the womans body. Because of this, the plague that the Israelites were experiencing stopped.

9. Twenty-four thousand people died from that plague.

10. Jehovah continued speaking to Moses:

11. Jehovah said to Moses: »Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron, turned my fury away from the Israelites. Since he stood up for me, I did not have to stand up for myself and destroy them.

12. »Tell Phinehas that I now make a promise of peace to him.

13. »My promise is that he and his descendants will be priests for a very long time because he stood up for his God. He made peace with Jehovah for the Israelites.«

14. The name of the Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri, son of Salu. Salu was the leader of a family from Simeon.

15. The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi, daughter of Zur. Zur was the head of a family from the Midianite tribes.

16. Jehovah said to Moses:

17. »Treat the Midianites as your enemies, and kill them!

18. »This is because they treated you as enemies. They plotted to trick you in the incident that took place at Peor. They used their sister Cozbi, daughter of a Midianite leader, who was killed on the day of the plague caused by the incident at Peor.«

## Numbers 26

1. After the plague Jehovah said to Moses and Eleazar son of the priest Aaron:

2. »Take a census of the entire congregation of Israel by households. List those who are at least twenty years old and eligible for military duty.«

3. Moses and the priest Eleazar spoke to the Israelites on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho. They said:

4. »Take a census of those at least twenty years old, as Jehovah commanded Moses.« These are the Israelites who came from Egypt:

52. Jehovah said to Moses:

53. »Use the list of names from the census to divide the land these people will possess.

54. »Give more land to larger tribes and less land to smaller ones. Use the totals from the census in giving land to each tribe.

55. »The land must also be divided by drawing lots. The tribes will receive their land based on the names of their ancestors.

56. »Whether the tribes are large or small, the land must be divided by drawing lots.«

57. The families descended from Levi were listed as the family of Gershon, the family of Kohath, and the family of Merari.

59. The name of Amrams wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born in Egypt. She gave birth to Amrams children: Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.

60. Aaron was the father of Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

61. Nadab and Abihu died because they offered unauthorized fire in Jehovahs presence.

62. The total number of all the Levite males at least one month old was twenty-three thousand. They were not counted along with the other Israelites, because they were given no land of their own.

63. Moses and the priest Eleazar added up the total number of Israelites on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho.

64. Not a single one of the Israelites Moses and the priest Aaron had counted in the Desert of Sinai were there.

65. Jehovah said: »They must all die in the desert wilderness.« The only ones left were Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.

## Numbers 27

1. Zelophehad, son of Hepher, grandson of Gilead, descendant of Machir, whose father was Manasseh, belonged to the families of Manasseh, son of Joseph. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

2. They came to Moses and stood in front of him, the priest Eleazar, the leaders, and the entire congregation at the entrance to the tent of meeting. They said:

3. »Our father died in the desert. He was not a part of Korahs followers who joined forces against Jehovah. He died for his own sin and left no sons.

4. »Why should our fathers name be allowed to die out in his family because he had no son? Give us property among our fathers relatives.«

5. So Moses brought their case to Jehovah.

6. Jehovah said to him:

7. »Zelophehads daughters are right. You must give them property of their own among their fathers relatives. Turn their fathers property over to them.

8. »Tell the Israelites: If a man dies and leaves no sons, turn his property over to his daughters.

9. »If he has no daughters give his property to his brothers.

10. »If he has no brothers give his property to his uncles on his fathers side of the family.

11. »If he has no uncles, give his property to the nearest relative in his family. That relative will take possession of it. This will be a rule for the Israelites, as Jehovah commanded Moses.«

12. Jehovah said to Moses: »Go up into the Abarim Mountains, and take a look at the land I will give the Israelites.

13. »After you see it, you, too, will join your ancestors in death, as your brother Aaron did.

14. »You both rebelled against my command in the Desert of Zin. You did not show the people how holy I am when they were complaining at the oasis. »This was the oasis of Meribah at Kadesh in the Desert of Zin.

15. Moses prayed:

16. »O Jehovah our God, source of all life, appoint, I pray, a man who can lead the people

17. and can command them in battle. Do not allow your congregation to be like sheep without a shepherd.«

18. Jehovah said to Moses: »Take Joshua son of Nun, a capable man, and place your hands on his head.

19. »Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the entire congregation, and there before them all proclaim him as your successor.

20. »Give him some of your authority, so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him.

21. »He will depend on Eleazar the priest, who will learn my will by using the Urim and Thummim. In this way Eleazar will direct Joshua and the whole congregation of Israel in all their affairs.«

22. Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. He had Joshua stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation.

23. Moses put his hands on Joshuas head and proclaimed him as his successor, just as Jehovah proclaimed.

## Numbers 28

1. Jehovah commanded Moses:

2. »Instruct the Israelites to present to God at the appointed time the required food offerings that are pleasing to him.

4. »Offer the first lamb in the morning, and the second in the evening,

5. each with a grain offering of two pounds of flour, mixed with two pints of the best olive oil.

6. »This is the daily offering that is completely burned. It was first offered at Mount Sinai as a food offering, an odor pleasing to Jehovah.

7. »As the wine offering with the first lamb, pour out at the altar two pints of wine.

8. »Offer the second lamb in the evening in the same way as the morning offering, together with its wine offering. It also is a food offering, an odor pleasing to Jehovah.

9. »On the Sabbath day offer two one-year-old male lambs without any defects, four pounds of flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering, and the wine offering.

10. »This burnt offering is to be offered every Sabbath in addition to the daily offering with its wine offering.

11. »At the beginning of each of your months you shall present a burnt offering to Jehovah: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without defect.

12. »With each bull there will be a grain offering of twenty-four cups of flour mixed with olive oil, with each ram a grain offering of sixteen cups of flour mixed with olive oil.

13. »With each one-year-old lamb a grain offering of eight cups of flour mixed with olive oil. This is a burnt offering, a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to Jehovah.

14. »The wine offering that goes with each bull will be two quarts of wine, with each ram one and one half quarts of wine, and with each lamb one quart of wine. This will be the monthly burnt offering for every month of the year.

18. »There will be a holy assembly on the first day. Do not do any regular work.

19. »Instead, bring Jehovah an offering by fire, a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven one-year-old lambs, all of them without defects.

20. »In addition to them bring grain offerings of flour mixed with olive oil. Bring twenty-four cups for each bull, sixteen cups for each ram,

21. and eight cups for each of the seven lambs.

22. »Also bring one male goat as an offering for sin to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah.

23. »Offer these in addition to the morning burnt offering.

25. »On the seventh day you must have a holy assembly. You must not do any regular work.

26. »During the Festival of Weeks, you must have a holy assembly. On that day you must not do any regular work. Bring Jehovah your new grain offering, the first produce harvested from your fields.

28. »Offer the proper grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil: six pounds with each bull, four pounds with the ram,

29. and two pounds with each lamb.

40. Moses told the Israelites everything Jehovah had commanded him.

## Numbers 30

1. Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel: This is what Jehovah has commanded about vows:

2. »If a man makes a vow to Jehovah that he will do something or swears an oath that he will not do something, he must not break his word. He must do everything he said he would do.

3. »A young girl, who still lives in her fathers house, might make a vow to Jehovah that she will do something or swear an oath that she will not do something.

4. »She must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her father raises an objection when he hears about it.

5. »If her father forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. Jehovah will forgive her, because her father refused to let her keep it.

6. »If an unmarried woman makes a vow, whether deliberately or carelessly, or promises to abstain from something, and then marries,

7. she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it.

8. »If her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. Jehovah will forgive her.

9. »A widow or a divorced woman must keep every vow she makes and every promise to abstain from something.

10. »If a married woman makes a vow or promises to abstain from something,

11. her husband may hear about it but may say nothing and not object. Then her vow or oath must be kept.

12. »But if her husband cancels it when he hears about it, nothing she said in her vow or oath has to be kept. Her husband has canceled it. Jehovah will free her from this vow or oath.

13. »A husband decides whether or not his wife has to keep any vow to do something or any oath to do without something.

14. »If he says nothing to her about it day after day, this means he decided that she must keep her vow or oath. She must keep it because he said nothing to her when he heard about it.

15. »If he cancels it later, he will suffer the consequences.«

16. These are the laws Jehovah gave Moses for husbands and wives, and for fathers with young daughters still living at home.

## Numbers 31

1. Jehovah said to Moses:

2. »Get even with the Midianites for what they did to the Israelites. After that you will join your ancestors in death.«

3. Moses said to the people: »Your men must get ready to go to war against the Midianites. Jehovah will use them to get even with Midian.

4. »Send one thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.«

5. Thus one thousand men from each tribe were supplied from the divisions of Israel, twelve thousand men ready for war.

6. Moses sent them off to war. There were one thousand men from each tribe along with Phinehas, son of the priest Eleazar. Phinehas took with him the holy articles and the trumpets for the fanfare.

7. They went to war against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses, and killed every man.

8. Included in those killed were the five kings of Midian-Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam, son of Beor, in battle.

9. The Israelites took the Midianite women and children as prisoners of war. They also took all their animals, their livestock, and their valuables as loot.

10. They burned the cities where the Midianites lived and all their settlements.

11. They took everything as loot including all the people and animals,

12. and brought the prisoners of war, the loot, and everything to Moses, the priest Eleazar, and the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho.

13. Moses, the priest Eleazar, and all the leaders of the congregation went outside the camp to meet them.

14. Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of the companies and battalions, who were returning from battle.

15. Moses asked them: »Have you spared all the women?

16. »Look, these women caused the Israelites, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor. Thus the congregation of Jehovah experienced the plague.

17. »So kill all the Midianite boys and every Midianite woman who has gone to bed with a man.

18. »But keep alive for yourselves every girl who has never gone to bed with a man.

19. »Everyone who killed a person or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp seven days. You and your prisoners of war must use the ritual water on the third and seventh days in order to take away your sin.

20. »You must do the same for all the clothes and everything made of leather, goats hair, or wood.«

21. Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle: »This is what Jehovahs Law told Moses to do:

22. »Only the gold and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin and the lead,

23. everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it will be clean. It must be purified with water for impurity. Anything that cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water.

24. »You must wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean. After that you may enter the camp.«

25. Jehovah spoke to Moses:

26. »You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the families of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured, both of man and of animal.

27. »Divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and the entire congregation.

28. »Levy a tax for Jehovah from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep.

29. »Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as an offering to Jehovah.

30. »From the sons of Israels half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.«

31. Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah commanded Moses.

32. The booty that remained from the spoil the men of war had plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,

33. and seventy-two thousand cattle,

34. and sixty-one thousand donkeys,

35. and of human beings, of the women who had not known man intimately, all the persons were thirty-two thousand.

36. The half, the portion of those who went out to war, was as follows: the number of sheep was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred.

37. Jehovahs levy of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.

38. There were thirty-six thousand cattle, from which Jehovahs levy was seventy-two.

39. There were thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, from which Jehovahs levy was sixty-one.

40. There were sixteen thousand human beings, from whom Jehovahs levy was thirty-two persons.

41. Moses gave the levy that was Jehovahs offering to Eleazar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

42. And from the Israelites half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war.

43. The congregations half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,

44. and thirty-six thousand cattle,

45. and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,

46. and the human beings were sixteen thousand.

47. Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals from the Israelites half. He gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, just as Jehovah commanded Moses.

48. Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses.

49. They said to Moses: »Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing.

50. »So we brought as an offering to Jehovah what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and ankle bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah.«

51. Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of molded articles.

52. All the gold of the offering they gave to Jehovah, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

53. Each of the men of war had taken booty.

54. So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before Jehovah.

## Numbers 32

1. The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a large number of livestock. They saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead was indeed a place suitable for livestock.

2. They approached Moses, the priest Eleazar, and the leaders of the congregation and said:

3. »Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,

4. the land Jehovah won for the congregation of Israel, is a good place for livestock. Gentlemen, we have livestock.«

5. »Please give us this land as our property. Do not make us cross the Jordan River.«

6. Moses asked the tribes of Gad and Reuben: Are you going to stay here while the rest of the Israelites go to war?

7. That might discourage them from entering the land Jehovah has given them.

8. That is what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look at the land.

9. They went as far as the Eshcol Valley. They saw the land. But then they discouraged the rest of the Israelites from entering the land Jehovah had given them.

10. That day Jehovah became angry and swore this oath:

11. »None of the people twenty years old or older, who came from Egypt, will see the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with an oath. This is because they did not wholeheartedly follow me.

12. »Only Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun will get to see the land. This is because they wholeheartedly followed Jehovah.

13. »Jehovahs anger blazed against the Israelites. Therefore he made them wander in the desert for forty years until the whole generation of those who had done evil in Jehovahs presence was gone.

14. »You are just like your parents! You are a bunch of sinners trying to make Jehovah angry at Israel again.

15. »If you turn away from him he will abandon all these people in the desert. You would be responsible for their destruction.«

16. The tribes of Gad and Reuben came to Moses and said: »Allow us to build stone fences for our livestock and cities for our families here.

17. »Then we will be ready to march in battle formation ahead of the other Israelites until we have brought them to their land. Meanwhile our families will live in walled cities. They will be safe from the other people who live here.

18. »We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his own land.

19. »We will not take possession of any land on the other side of the Jordan River, to the west and beyond. We already have our land here, east of the Jordan.«

20. Moses answered: »If you really mean what you say, then here in the presence of Jehovah get ready to go into battle.

21. »All your fighting men are to cross the Jordan and under Jehovahs command they are to attack our enemies until Jehovah defeats them

22. and takes possession of the land. You may return after that, because you will have fulfilled your obligation to Jehovah and to the other Israelites. Then Jehovah will acknowledge that this land east of the Jordan is yours.

23. »If you do not keep your promise, I warn you that you will be sinning against Jehovah. Do not doubt this, you will be punished for your sin.

24. »So build your towns and the enclosures for your sheep, but do what you have promised!«

25. The men from Reuben and Gad answered Moses: »Sir, we will do just what you have said.

26. »Our wives, children, sheep and cattle will stay here in the towns in Gilead.

27. »However those of us prepared for battle will cross the Jordan and fight for Jehovah.«

28. Moses said to Eleazar, Joshua, and the family leaders:

29. »Make sure the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you. If they do, then after the land is in your control, give them the region of Gilead as their tribal land.

30. »But if they break their promise, they will receive land on the other side of the Jordan, like the rest of the tribes.«

31. The tribes of Gad and Reuben replied: »We are your servants and will do whatever Jehovah has commanded.

32. »We will enter Canaan as armed troops in Jehovahs presence. The land we will take possession of is here, east of the Jordan.«

33. So Moses gave the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph, the kingdoms of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan. It was the whole land with its cities and its surrounding territory.

34. The tribe of Gad rebuilt the cities of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,

35. Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,

36. Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran as walled cities. They also built stone fences for their flocks.

37. The tribe of Reuben rebuilt the cities of Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,

38. Nebo, Baal Meon whose names were changed, and Sibmah. These are the names they gave the cities they rebuilt.

39. The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead. They captured it and forced out the Amorites who were there.

40. So Moses gave Gilead to the people of Machir the descendants of Manasseh, and they lived there.

41. Then Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured the settlements in Gilead. He called them Havvoth Jair.

42. Nobah captured Kenath and its villages. He named it Nobah after himself.

4. »It will turn southward toward Akrabbim Pass and continue on through Zin as far south as Kadesh Barnea. It will turn northwest to Hazar Addar and on to Azmon,

4. »The land around the cities that you give the Levites will extend fifteen hundred feet from the city wall.

5. »Outside the city measure off three thousand feet on the east side, three thousand feet on the south side, three thousand feet on the west side, and three thousand feet on the north side, with the city in the center. This will be their pastureland around the city.

6. »Six of the cities you give the Levites will be cities of refuge. You must allow murderers to escape to these cities. In addition, you must also give the Levites forty-two other cities.

7. »You will give a total of forty-eight cities with pastureland to the Levites.

8. »The cities you give the Levites from the property of the other Israelites must be given based on the amount of land each tribe owns. Take more cities from larger tribes and fewer from smaller tribes.«

9. Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:

10. »Tell the Israelites: When you cross the Jordan River and enter Canaan,

11. select certain cities to be places of refuge. Anyone who unintentionally kills another person may run to them.

12. »These cities will be places of refuge from any relative who can avenge the death. So anyone accused of murder will not have to die until he has had a trial in front of the community.

13. »There will be six cities you select as places of refuge.

14. »Three will be on the east side of the Jordan River and three in Canaan.

15. »These six cities will be places of refuge for Israelites, foreigners, and strangers among you. Anyone who unintentionally kills another person may flee to these cities.

16. »If any of you uses an iron weapon to kill another person, you are a murderer. Murderers must be put to death.

17. »If any of you picks up a stone as a weapon and uses it to kill another person, you are a murderer. Murderers must be put to death.

18. »And if any of you picks up a piece of wood as a weapon and uses it to kill another person, you are a murderer. Murderers must be put to death.

19. »The relative who can avenge the death must make sure a murderer is put to death. When he catches up with the murderer, he must kill him.

20. »If any of you kills someone you hate by shoving him or by deliberately throwing something at him,

21. or if you beat your enemy to death with your bare hands, you must be put to death. You are a murderer. The relative who can avenge the death must kill you when he catches up with you, because you are a murderer.

22. »Should you accidentally kill someone who was not your enemy. Maybe you shoved him or threw something at him but did not mean to kill him.

23. »Or if you drop a big stone, and someone is killed. However, you did not know the person was there, he was not your enemy, and you were not trying to harm him.

24. »Then the community must use these rules in order to decide if you are innocent or if the dead persons relative can avenge the death.

25. »If you are innocent, the community must protect you from that relative. They must take you back to the city of refuge you fled to. You must live there until the death of the chief priest who was anointed with the holy oil.

26. »But do not go outside the city of refuge you fled to.

27. »If the relative who can avenge the death finds you outside the city of refuge and kills you, the relative is not guilty of murder.

28. »Accused murderers must stay in their city of refuge until the death of the chief priest. They may go back to their own property only after his death.

29. »These rules apply to you and your descendants wherever you may live.

30. »Those accused of murder may be found guilty and put to death only on the evidence of two or more witnesses. The evidence of one witness is not sufficient to support an accusation of murder.

31. »Murderers must be put to death. They cannot escape this penalty by the payment of money.

32. »If they have fled to a city of refuge, do not allow them to make a payment in order to return home before the death of the High Priest.

33. »If you did this, you would defile the land where you are living. Murder defiles the land, and except by the death of the murderer there is no way to perform the ritual of purification for the land where someone has been murdered.

34. »Do not defile the land where you are living! I am Jehovah and I live among the people of Israel.«

## Numbers 36

1. The heads of the families in the clan of Gilead the son of Machir and grandson of Manasseh son of Joseph, went to Moses and the other leaders.

2. They said: »Jehovah commanded you to distribute the land to the people of Israel by drawing lots. He also commanded you to give the property of our relative Zelophehad to his daughters.

3. »Remember, if they marry men of another tribe, their property will then belong to that tribe, and the total allotted to us will be reduced.

4. »During the Year of Restoration, when all property that has been sold is restored to its original owners, the property of Zelophehads daughters will be permanently added to the tribe into which they marry and will be lost to our tribe.«

5. So Moses gave the people of Israel the following command from Jehovah. He said: »What the tribe of Manasseh says is right,

6. and so Jehovah says that the daughters of Zelophehad are free to marry anyone they wish but only within their own tribe.

7. »The property of every Israelite will remain attached to his tribe.

8. »Every woman who inherits property in an Israelite tribe must marry a man belonging to that tribe. In this way all Israelites will inherit the property of their ancestors,

9. and the property will not pass from one tribe to another. Each tribe will continue to possess its own property.«

10. Zelophehads daughters did as Jehovah commanded Moses.

11. Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah married their cousins on their fathers side of the family.

12. They married within the families of the descendants of Manasseh, son of Joseph. So their land stayed in the tribe of their fathers family.

13. These are the commandments and rules Jehovah gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho.
