## Joshua 1

__(Writer: Joshua) (1450 B.C.E.)__

1. Moses the servant of Jehovah died. After his death Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying:

2. »Moses my servant is dead. Arise and cross over the Jordan River. Take the people into the land given to them, even to the children of Israel.

3. »I give you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon just as I promised Moses.

4. »From the wilderness and nearby Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun to the west, shall be your coast.

5. »No man will be able to resist you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.

6. »Be strong and courageous for you will help this people inherit the land. This is the land I swore to give to their fathers.

7. »Be strong and very courageous, that you may be careful to do according to all the Law, which Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.

8. »This Book of the Law will not depart out of your mouth. You must meditate intensely studythink deeply on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. Then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.

9. »Have I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage. Do not be afraid, neither be dismayed; for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.«

10. Joshua commanded the officers of the people. He said:

11. »Pass through the middle of the camp and command the people, say: Prepare your provisions. In three days you will pass over this Jordan. You will go in to possess the land that Jehovah your God gave you to possess.«

12. And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said:

13. »Remember the word Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you: Jehovah your God has given you rest, and has given you this land.«

14. »Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them.

15. »Your brothers will possess the land Jehovah gave them until Jehovah gives your brothers rest. Then you will return to the land you possess and enjoy it. This is the land Jehovahs servant Moses gave you on this side of Jordan toward the sunrise to the east.«

16. They answered Joshua: »All that you command us we will do. Wherever you send us we will go.

17. »Just as we listened to Moses in all things, we will listen to you in all things. May Jehovah your God be with you, as he was with Moses.

18. »Whoever rebels against your commandment, and does not listen to your words in all that you command him must be put to death. Be strong and of a good courage.«

## Joshua 2

1. Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly. He said: »Go view the land of Jericho.« They went to a prostitute named Rahab, and stayed at her house.

2. The king of Jericho was told: »Men of the children of Israel came here tonight to search out the country.«

3. The king of Jericho sent for Rahab, saying: »Bring the men that came to you and stayed at your house. They came to spy on all the country.«

4. The woman took the two men, and hid them. She said: »Men came to me but I did not know where they came from.«

5. When it was dark and they shut the gate the men went out. I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly and you will overtake them.

6. She hid them on the rooftop of the house. She covered them with stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.

7. The men pursued them by the road to Jordan to the fords. As soon the pursuers went out they shut the gate.

8. Before they laid down to sleep she came up to them on the roof.

9. She said to the men: »I know Jehovah has given you the land and the terror of you has fallen on us. All the inhabitants of the land are afraid of you.

10. »We heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red sea for you when you came out of Egypt. And what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

11. »As soon as we heard these things we became discouraged. No man had courage because of you. Jehovah your God is God in heaven above and on earth below.

12. »I pray that you will swear to me by Jehovah, since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness to my fathers house, and give me a true tokensignpledge of truth;

13. »That you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers and sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.«

14. The men answered her: »Our life for yours, if you do not reveal our business. It will be, when Jehovah has given us the land. We will deal kindly and truly with you.«

15. Then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall. She lived on the wall.

16. She said: »Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers return and afterward go your way.«

17. The men said to her: »We will be free from this oath you made us swear.

18. »When we come into the land, tie this scarlet cord in the window from which you let us down. Bring your father, mother, brothers and sisters and your fathers entire household into your home.

19. »Whoever goes out of your house into the street will be responsible for his own life. We will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is laid on him.

20. »If you tell what we are doing we will be released from the oath you made us swear.«

21. She said: »Let it be according to your words.« They departed and she tied the scarlet line in the window.

22. They went to the mountain and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers looked for them everywhere but did not find them.

23. So the two men descended from the mountain. They returned to Joshua the son of Nun and told him all the things that happened to them.

24. They said to Joshua: »Truly Jehovah has delivered into our hands all of the land. The inhabitants of the country are afraid of us.«

## Joshua 3

1. Joshua rose early in the morning. They left Shittim for Jordan. He and all the children of Israel lodged there before they crossed over.

2. After three days the officers went through the camp.

3. They commanded the people, saying: »When you see the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, you should leave here and follow it.

4. »You should keep a space of a thousand yards between you and the ark. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go: for you have not passed this way before.«

5. Joshua said to the people: »Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow Jehovah will do amazing things among you.«

6. Joshua spoke to the priests: »Take up the Ark of the Covenant, and pass over before the people.« So they took the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people.

7. Jehovah said to Joshua: »This day will I begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel. Now they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.

8. »You will command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant, saying: When you come to the shore of the Jordan River you will stand still in the Jordan.«

9. Joshua said to the children of Israel: »Come here and hear the words of Jehovah your God.«

10. Joshua said: »By this you shall know the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

11. »The Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah the God of all the earth passed over before you into Jordan.

12. »Take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel.

13. »As soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, set foot in the Jordan the waters of Jordan shall be cut off and they shall stand in a heap.«

14. When the people set out from their camp to cross the Jordan, and the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and

15. As they carried the ark into the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped into the water, for Jordan is at food stage at the time of harvest.

16. The waters stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city Adam that is beside Zaretan. The waters that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off. The people passed over the Jericho.

17. The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River. All the Israelites passed over the Jordan River on dry ground.

## Joshua 4

1. All the people finished crossing the Jordan River. Then Jehovah spoke to Joshua:

2. Take twelve men out of the people. Take a man out of every tribe.

3. Command them by saying: »Take twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests feet stood firm. Carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you stay tonight.«

4. Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared from the children of Israel, a man from every tribe.

5. Joshua said to them: »Pass over before the Ark of Jehovah your God to the middle of the Jordan River. Let every man take a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel.

6. »This may be a sign among you when your children ask their fathers what is the meaning of these stones?

7. »You will answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah. When it passed over Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will be for a memorial to the children of Israel for as long as they live.«

8. The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan. This was just as Jehovah spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel. They carried them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there.

9. Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River, in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant stood, and they are there to this day.

10. The priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan River. They stood there until every thing that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people was carried out, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. During this time the people hurried to the other side of the river.

11. All the people crossed over. Then the priests, in the presence of the people, carried the Ark of Jehovah across.

12. The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.

13. About forty thousand, prepared for war, passed over before Jehovah to do battle in the plains of Jericho.

14. On that day Jehovah exulted Joshua in the sight of all Israel. They feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.

15. Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying:

16. »Command the priests who carry the Ark of the Testimony that they come up from the Jordan.«

17. Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying: »Come up from the Jordan.«

18. When the priests that carried the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah were up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up onto the dry land that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before.

19. The people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

20. Joshua set up the twelve stones they took out of the Jordan River, in Gilgal.

21. He spoke to the children of Israel: »When your children will ask their fathers in time to come, what these stones mean?

22. »Then you will let your children know, saying: Israel came over this Jordan River on dry land.

23. »For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you, until you all crossed over. As Jehovah your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we crossed over.

24. »That all the people of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah is mighty: that you might reverence Jehovah your God forever.«

## Joshua 5

1. When all the kings of the Amorites, on the west side of the Jordan River and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we passed over, their hearts grew faint with fear. They were discouraged because of the children of Israel.

2. Jehovah said to Joshua: »Make sharp knives, and circumcise the men of Israel.«

3. Joshua made sharp knives, and circumcised the men of Israel at the Hill of Circumcision.

4. This is why Joshua circumcised: All the men who came out of Egypt including all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

5. Now all the people that came out were circumcised. But all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt were not circumcised.

6. The children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah. Jehovah swore that he would not show them the land, which he swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.

7. Joshua circumcised their children, whom he raised up in their place. They had not circumcised them in the wilderness.

8. When they were done circumcising all the people they stayed in the camp till they were healed.

9. Jehovah said to Joshua: »This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.« So the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.

10. The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.

11. After the Passover they ate the old corn of the land, unleavened cakes, and parched corn.

12. The manna ceased the morning after they ate the old corn of the land. The children of Israel had no more manna. But they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

13. When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, there stood a man in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said: »Are you on our side or our adversaries?«

14. He said: »No, but as captain of the camp of Jehovah I now come.« And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down and said: »What does my lord say to his servant?«

15. The captain commander of Jehovahs host army said to Joshua: »Take your shoes from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy.« And at once Joshua did so.

## Joshua 6

__BATTLE OF JERICHO__

1. Now Jericho was tightly shut up because the people were afraid of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.

2. Jehovah said to Joshua: »See, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king there, and the mighty men of valor.

3. »March around the city with all your armed men. Go around the city once per day for six days.

4. »Seven priests will carry before you seven trumpets of rams horns along with the Ark. On the seventh day march around the city seven times. The priests shall blow the trumpets.

5. »When you hear a long blast with the rams horn, all the people will shout with a great shout. The wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up, every man straight in to the city.«

6. Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them: »Take up the Ark of the Covenant. Seven priests should carry seven trumpets of rams horns before the Ark of Jehovah.«

7. He said to the people: »Pass on, and circle the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the Ark of Jehovah.«

8. As soon as Joshua spoke to the people the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams horns passed before Jehovah. They blew the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah followed them.

9. The armed men marched ahead of the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the Ark. All the time the priests kept blowing the trumpets.

10. Joshua commanded the people, saying: »You will not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither will any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout. Then you will shout.«

11. So the Ark of Jehovah went around the city one time. They came to the camp, and stayed in the camp.

12. Joshua rose early in the morning. The priests picked up the Ark of Jehovah.

13. Seven priests carrying seven trumpets of rams horns before the Ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew with the trumpets. The armed men went before them. The rear guard followed the Ark of Jehovah. The priests were blowing the trumpet.

14. And the second day they went around the city once, and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.

15. They rose early at dawn on the seventh day. They circled the city in the same manner. Only on that day they went around the city seven times.

16. On the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people: »Shout for Jehovah has given you the city.

17. »The city and everything in it will be destroyed. It belongs to Jehovah. Only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in her house will live. Because she hid the messengers we sent.

18. »You people must stay away from anything devoted to destruction. You should not take things from the city. You will cause trouble for the camp of Israel is you take of the accursed things.

19. »All the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to Jehovah. They must come into the treasury of Jehovah.«

20. So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, the wall fell down flat. The people went into the city, every man straight ahead. They captured the city.

21. They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

22. Joshua said to the two men that had spied out the country: »Go into the harlots house, and bring the woman out as you swore to her.«

23. The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, mother, and her brothers and all that she had. They brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel.

24. They burned the city and all its contents. They put the silver, gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.

25. Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her fathers household, and all that she had. She dwells in Israel even to this day because she hid the messengers Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

26. Joshua pronounced an oath at that time, saying: »Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that rises up and builds this city Jericho. He will lay the foundation at the cost of his firstborn. He will set up the gates at the cost of his youngest son.«

27. Jehovah was with Joshua and his fame spread throughout all the country.

## Joshua 7

1. The children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.

2. Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel. He spoke to them: »Go up and spy on the country.« And the men went up and spied on Ai.

3. They returned to Joshua, and said: »Do not send all the people. Send about two or three thousand men to Ai to go up and capture Ai. Do not bother all the people for there are only a few there.«

4. So about three thousand men left the people. The men of Ai routed them.

5. The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them: for they chased them going down from before the gate to Shebarim. The heart of the people melted, and became as water. The Israelites lost their courage and were afraid

6. And Joshua ripped his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark of Jehovah until evening. He threw dust on his head. The elders of Israel did the same.

7. Joshua said: »Alas, Sovereign Lord Jehovah, why did you bring this people across the Jordan. Was it to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would to God we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan!

8. »O Jehovah, what shall I say, when Israel turned their backs before its enemies!

9. »For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear about it, and will surround us and cut our name off from the earth. What will you do for your great name?«

10. Jehovah said to Joshua: »You get up! Why are you on your face?

11. »Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things and put them in their own possessions.

12. »Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies. They ran from their enemies, because they were accursed. I will not be with you any more until you destroy the devoted things you have among you.

13. »Get up and sanctify the people. Say: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: »There is an accursed thing in the midst of you, O Israel: You cannot stand before you enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.«

14. »»In the morning assemble by tribe. The tribe Jehovah picks will come forward family by family and man by man.

15. »»He that has take the devoted things shall be burned in the fire, along with all that he owns. He has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah. He has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.« «

16. So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

17. He brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:

18. And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.

19. Joshua said to Achan: »My son, give glory to Jehovah God of Israel and confess to him. Tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me.«

20. Achan answered Joshua: »Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel. This I have done.

21. »When I saw among the spoils a quality Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them. I hid them in the earth in the middle of my tent.«

22. So Joshua sent messengers to the tent and found it and the silver.

23. They took them out of the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before Jehovah.

24. And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.

25. Joshua said: »Why have you troubled us? Jehovah will trouble you this day.« All Israel stoned them with stones. After they stoned them they burned them with fire.

26. They raised over them a great heap of stones that is there to this day. So Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. The name of that place was called, the Valley of Achor, to this day.

## Joshua 8

1. Jehovah said to Joshua: »Do not fear and do not be discouraged troubledconfused. Take all the people of war with you and go up to Ai. I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.

2. »Do to Ai and her king what you did to Jericho and her king. Take the spoil and the cattle for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.«

3. Joshua and all the people of war went up against Ai. Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.

4. He commanded them, saying: »You shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city. Do not go very far from the city and be ready.

5. »I, and all the people that are with me, will approach the city. When they come out against us we will run away from them.

6. »They will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city. They will say: They run from us. Therefore we will run before them.

7. »Then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.

8. »When you have taken the city you will set the city on fire according to the commandment of Jehovah. See, I have commanded you.«

9. Joshua sent them forth. They went to lie in ambush, and stay between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai. Joshua lodged that night among the people.

10. Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered his men. He and the elders of Israel went in front of the people to Ai.

11. And all the people, even the people of war that were with him went to the city. They set up camp on the north side of Ai. There was a valley between them and Ai.

12. He took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

13. They had the solders take up their positions those in camp to the north and the ambush to the west. Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

14. When the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed headed for the plain. He did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.

15. Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten in front of them and ran away to the wilderness.

16. All the people in Ai were called together to chase after them. They chased after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.

17. There was no man left in Ai or Bethel. They all went after Israel: and they left the city open.

18. Jehovah said to Joshua: »Stretch out the spear javelin that is in your hand toward Ai.« I will give it to your hand. Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.

19. The ambush began quickly. They ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand. They entered into the city, captured it and quickly set the city on fire.

20. The men of Ai looked behind and saw the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven. They had no power to run this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

21. When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended they turned and killed the men of Ai.

22. The men of the ambush came out of the city against them. They were caught in the middle with Israel on both sides. Israel killed them all. No one remained or escaped.

23. They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.

24. When Israel finished slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and killed it with the edge of the sword.

25. Twelve thousand men and women of Ai were killed that day.

26. Joshua did not withdraw his hand. He stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

27. Israel took the cattle and the spoil of that city for preys for themselves, according to the word Jehovah commanded Joshua.

28. Joshua burnt Ai and made it a heap forever, even desolation to this day.

29. He hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening. As soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they take his carcass down from the tree and throw it at the entering gate of the city. They raised a large pile of rocks over it that is there to this day.

30. Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel on mount Ebal,

31. As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses, an altar of whole stones that have not been cut by any iron tool. They offered offerings to Jehovah, and sacrificed peace offerings.

32. He wrote upon the stones a copy of the Law of Moses. He did this in the presence of the children of Israel.

33. All Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on both sides of the Ark before the priests. The Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; Half of the people stood on Mount Gerizim. And half of them stood on Mount Ebal. As Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

34. Afterward he read all the words of the Law, the blessings and cursing, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.

35. There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

## Joshua 9

1. All the kings west of Jordan heard these things; the kings in the hills, and in the valleys, in all the coasts of the Great Mediterraean Sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite heard these things.

2. They gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord unanimouslyone purpose.

3. When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,

4. They resorted to a ruse schemetrick. They acted as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, worn out, torn, and mended.

5. They had worn out and patched shoes on their feet, they wore old garments; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.

6. They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel: »We come from a distant country, make a treaty with us.«

7. The men of Israel said to the Hivites: »Perhaps you live near us. How can we make a treaty with you?«

8. They said: »We are your servants.« Joshua said to them: »Who are you? Where do you come from?«

9. They said: »From a very far country, your servants came because of the name of Jehovah your God, for we have heard about him and all he did in Egypt;

10. »and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

11. »Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying: Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them: »We are your servants. Therefore make a treaty with us.« «

12. »We took hot fresh bread for our provision out of our houses on the day we came to you. Now it is dry, and it is moldy:

13. »These bottles of wine, which we filled, were new and now they are cracked. Our garments and shoes have become old by reason of the very long journey.«

14. The men sampled their provisions but did not ask for counsel from Jehovah.

15. Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live. The leaders of the congregation ratified it by an oath.

16. At the end of three days after they had made a treaty with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.

17. The children of Israel journeyed to their cities on the third day. Their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.

18. The children of Israel did not kill them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Jehovah God of Israel. The entire congregation murmured against the princes.

19. But all the leaders said to the entire congregation: »We have sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.

20. »This we will do to them. We will even let them live in case we become angry. This is because of the oath we swore to them.«

21. The leaders said to them: »Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to the entire congregation as the leaders had promised them.

22. Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying: »Why did you deceive us, saying: We are very far from you when you dwell among us?

23. Now you are cursed, and none of you will be freed from being slaves, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.«

24. They answered Joshua: »For the reason that it was absolutely told to your servants, how Jehovah your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and destroy all the inhabitants of the land. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you. So we did this thing.

25. »Now we are in your hands. Do to us what seems good and right to you.«

26. Joshua saved them from the children of Israel. They did not kill them.

27. Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah, even to this day, in the place he should choose.

## Joshua 10

1. When Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king. The inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Israel and were living near them.

2. They were very afraid because Gibeon was a great royal city. It was larger than Ai and all the men there were great fighters.

3. Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying:

4. »Come to me and help me, that we may strike Gibeon: for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.«

5. Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon gathered together. They and all their hosts came before Gibeon and camped. Then they made war against it.

6. The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal saying: Do not abandon your servants. Come to us quickly and save us. Help us for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.

7. So Joshua and all the people of war, the mighty warriors, ascended from Gilgal.

8. Jehovah said to Joshua: »Do not fear them. I have delivered them into your hands. Not one man of them will stand before you.«

9. Joshua came against them suddenly by surprise at night.

10. Jehovah threw them into confusion before Israel. They were killed in a great battle at Gibeon. They were chased along the road that goes up to Beth-horon. They were slaughtered all the way to Azekah, and Makkedah.

11. As they fled from Israel, and were going down to Beth-horon, Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them all the way to Azekah and they died. In fact hailstones killed more than the children of Israel killed using their swords.

12. Joshua spoke to Jehovah the day when Jehovah delivered the Amorites to the children of Israel. He said in sight of Israel: »Sun, stand still upon Gibeon; and Moon, stand still in the valley of Ajalon.«

13. The sun stood still, and the moon stood still, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not go down for a whole day.

14. There was no day like that before or after it, that Jehovah listened to the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.

15. All Israel returned with Joshua to the camp at Gilgal.

16. These five kings ran away and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.

17. Joshua was told: »The five kings are found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.«

18. Joshua said: »Roll large stones in front of the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.

19. »Do not stay there but pursue after your enemies and strike the rear guard. Do not enter their cities for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.«

20. When Joshua and the children of Israel finished slaying them those who escaped entered the fortified cities.

21. All the people returned in peace to Joshuas at Makkedah. No one spoke against any of the children of Israel.

22. Then Joshua said: »Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me.«

23. They did so, and brought the five kings to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

24. When they brought out the kings to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him: »Come near, put your feet on the back of the necks of humiliateabase these kings.« They came near, and put their feet upon their necks.

25. Joshua said: »Do not be afraid. Do not be terrified! Be strong and have courage: for this is what Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.«

26. Afterward Joshua struck and killed them. He hanged them on five trees: and they hung on the trees until evening.

27. At sunset Joshua commanded that they remove them. They took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave where they had been hidden. They laid large stones in the mouth of the cave. Even today the stones are there.

28. That day Joshua struck Makkedah with the edge of the sword. The king was destroyed all the people who lived there. He let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah the same as he did to the king of Jericho.

29. Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel went with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

30. Jehovah delivered it and the king into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the persons who lived there. He let none remain: and he did to the king of Libnah as he did to the king of Jericho.

31. Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

32. Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel on the second day. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the persons who lived there according to all that he had done to Libnah.

33. Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. Joshua killed him and his people, until he had left none remaining.

34. From Lachish Joshua went to Eglon, and all Israel with him. They encamped against it, and fought against it:

35. They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword. All that were there were destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

36. Joshua and all Israel with him went from Eglon to Hebron; and they fought against it:

37. They capture it and destroyed it with the edge of the sword. This included the king and all the cities, and all the people who were there. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and destroyed all the people there.

38. Joshua and all Israel returned with him to Debir and fought against it:

39. He took it, and the king and all the cities there. They killed them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all people there. He left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.

40. So Joshua struck all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah God of Israel commanded.

41. And Joshua conquered them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

42. All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.

43. Joshua returned, and all Israel returned with him to the camp at Gilgal.

## Joshua 11

1. Jabin king of Hazor heard about this. So he sent a message to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

2. and to the kings north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,

3. and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

4. They came out with all their troops and many horses and chariots. Their army was more numerous than the sand of the seashore.

5. All the kings met at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.

6. Jehovah said to Joshua: »Do not be afraid because of them! About this time tomorrow I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. You must hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.«

7. So Joshua and all the people of war with him came up against them. Suddenly they attacked them by the waters of Merom.

8. Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, who killed them. They chased them unto great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they killed them. They did not leave any survivor remain.

9. Joshua did to them what Jehovah told him to do. He hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.

10. Joshua then turned back, and captured Hazor. He killed the king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms.

11. They killed all the people there with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them. None were left alive. He burned Hazor with fire.

12. Joshua took all the cities and all the kings and struck them with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them. Just as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.

13. Israel did not burn the cities that stood on their own mounds with the exception of Hazor, which Joshua burned.

14. Israel took all the spoil of these cities including the cattle. They killed every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them all. None were left alive.

15. Jehovah commanded Moses his servant and so Moses commands Joshua and Joshua complied. He left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.

16. Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same.

17. Even from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He captured and killed all their kings.

18. Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings.

19. Not one city made peace with the children of Israel except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all the others in battle.

20. It was Jehovah who hardened their hearts to make war against Israel. That way he could completely destroy them. That they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

21. Joshua cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel. Joshua destroyed them utterly along with their cities.

22. There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel. Some of them remained in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.

23. So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah said to Moses. Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions, by their tribes. The land rested from war.

## Joshua 12

1. These are the kings of the land that the children of Israel defeated and whos territory they captured. It was on the other side of Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east.

2. Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the Arnon River, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the children of Ammon;

3. And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah:

4. The coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

5. And reigned in Mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

6. Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel killed them. Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

7. These are the kings of the country that Joshua and the children of Israel conquered on this side of the Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

8. In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

9. The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;

10. The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

11. The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

23. The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;

24. The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings being thirty-one.

## Joshua 13

1. Jehovah said to Joshua: You are old and advanced in years. There still remains much land to be possessed.

2. This is the land that yet remains: »All the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,

3. »from Shihor, which is near Egypt, to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:

4. »from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:

5. »The land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, to the east, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon to the Hamath border.

6. »All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the children of Israel. Divide it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.

7. »Divide this land for an inheritance among the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh.«

8. With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.

9. From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon

10. All the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;

11. And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salcah;

12. The kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants. Moses defeated them and took over their land.

13. Nevertheless the children of Israel did not expel the Geshurites, or the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

14. He gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The sacrifices of Jehovah God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said to them.

15. Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.

16. Their coast was from Aroer that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba,

17. Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,

18. And Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

19. And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley,

20. And Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,

21. All the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses killed with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, who were dukes of Sihon, living in the country.

22. Balaam was also the son of Beor, the soothsayer. The children of Israel slayed him along with all who were slain with the sword.

23. The border of the children of Reuben was Jordan and its border. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages there.

24. Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad according to their families.

25. Their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is near Rabbah;

26. From Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

27. In the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

28. This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.

29. Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh. This was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by families.

30. Their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities:

31. Half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.

32. These are the countries that Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.

33. But he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. Jehovah God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said to them.

## Joshua 14

1. These are the countries that the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for their inheritance.

2. Their inheritance was by lot. Jehovah commanded the hand of Moses to distribute to the nine tribes and the half tribe.

3. Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half tribe on the other side of the Jordan. He gave no inheritance to the Levites.

4. The children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. No part of the land was given to the Levites. They were given cities in which to live and a place for their cattle and personally property.

5. The people of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses. They divided the land.

6. Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him: »You know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea.

7. »I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.

8. »Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people dissolve. But I wholly followed Jehovah my God.

9. »Moses swore on that day, saying: Surely the land where your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance, and your childrens from generation to generation, because you have completely followed Jehovah my God.

10. »Jehovah has kept me alive, as he said, these forty-five years, even since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. Now I am this day eighty-five years old.

11. »So far I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength is now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.

12. »Now therefore give me this mountain. This is where Jehovah spoke that day. You heard about the Anakims that day. Their cities were large and fortified and Jehovah helped me drive them out just as Jehovah said.«

13. Joshua blessed Caleb the son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron for an inheritance.

14. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day, because that he wholly followed Jehovah the God of Israel.

15. Hebron was previously named Kirjath-arba. Arba was a great man among the Anakims. The land and its people had rest from war.

## Joshua 15

1. This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families: The border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the farthest part of the south coast.

2. The shore of the salt sea was their south border, from the bay that looks southward:

3. From there it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side to Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and went around to Karka:

4. From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the river of Egypt and ended at the south coast at the sea.

5. The east border was the salt sea to the end of Jordan. Their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

6. Their border continued to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah. The border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:

7. The border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river. Then the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh and came out at En-rogel:

8. The border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the Valley of the Giants northward:

9. Then the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim:

10. The border circled Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:

11. And the border went out to the north side of Ekron: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to Mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel to the sea.

12. The west border was to the coast of the great sea. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.

13. To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.

14. From Hebron Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

15. He went to the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir previously was Kirjath-sepher.

16. Caleb said: »I will give Achsah my daughter in marriage to the man who captures it and kills Kirjath-sepher.«

17. Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

18. She came to him and convinced him to ask of her father for a field. She dismounted her donkey and Caleb said to her: »What do you wish?«

19. She answered: »Give me a blessing. For you have given me a land in the south which includes springs of water.« He gave her the upper springs, and the lower springs.

20. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.

21. The cities at the limits of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

22. Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

23. Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

24. Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

25. Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

30. Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

31. Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

32. Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty- nine, with their villages:

33. In the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

34. Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

35. Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

39. Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

40. Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

42. Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

43. Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

44. Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:

45. Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

46. From Ekron even to the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages:

47. Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, to the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border there.

48. In the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

49. Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah, which is Debir,

50. Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

51. Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:

52. Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

53. Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,

54. Humtah, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages:

55. Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

56. Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

57. Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

58. Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,

59. Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:

60. Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:

61. In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,

62. Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.

63. As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out. The Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.

## Joshua 16

1. The lot was for the children of Joseph. It fell from the Jordan by Jericho, to the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel.

2. It goes out from Bethel to Luz, and passes along to the borders of Archi to Ataroth,

3. It goes down westward to the coast of Japhleti, to the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: ending at the sea.

4. So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.

5. The border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar, to Beth-horon the upper;

6. The border went toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

7. It went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

8. The border went out from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah; and from there to the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.

9. The separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.

10. They did not drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and have become forced laborers.

## Joshua 17

1. There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh. He was the firstborn of Joseph. Machir was the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

2. There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families. For the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

3. But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

4. They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying: »Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.« Therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.

5. Ten shares fell to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, on the other side of Jordan

6. Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manassehs sons had the land of Gilead.

7. The coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah. It lies before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.

8. Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.

9. The coast descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and it ended at the sea.

10. Southward it was Ephraims, and northward it was Manassehs, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

11. Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

12. Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

13. When the children of Israel were very strong they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor. They did not completely drive them out.

14. The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying: »Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as Jehovah has blessed us abundantly.«

15. Joshua answered: »If you are a great people, then get to the wood country, and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for you.«

16. The children of Joseph said: »The hill is not enough for us. All the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.«

17. Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying: »You are a great people. You have great power. You will not have only one lot.

18. »The mountain will be yours. For it is a wood, and you will cut it down. The farthest limits will be yours. You will drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong.«

## Joshua 18

1. The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh. They set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. The land was subdued before them.

2. There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes that had not yet received their inheritance.

3. Joshua said to the children of Israel: »How long will you neglect to go to possess the land, which Jehovah the God of your fathers has given you?

4. »Appoint three men from each tribe: and I will send them, and they will rise, and go through the land, and write a description of it according to their inheritance. Then they will return to me.

5. »They will divide it into seven parts: Judah will abide in their border on the south, and the house of Joseph will abide in their border on the north.

6. »You will write a description of the land divided into seven parts, and bring the description to me, that I may cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.

7. »The Levites have no part among you. The priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance. Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the Jehovah gave them.«

8. The men stood up and went away. Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying: »Go and walk through the land, and write a description of it, and come again to me, that I may cast lots for you before Jehovah in Shiloh.«

9. The men went and passed through the land, and wrote a description of it by cities into seven parts in a book, and returned to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.

10. Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah. Then Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.

11. The lot for the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the boundary of their lot came between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

12. And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and it ended at the wilderness of Bethaven.

13. The border went from there to Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lies on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.

14. From the hill that lies before Beth-horon southward; and it ended at Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.

15. And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah.

16. The border came down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,

17. And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,

18. It passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah:

19. The border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.

20. Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the border according to their families.

21. Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

22. Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

23. Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,

28. And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.

## Joshua 19

1. The second lot came for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.

2. Their inheritance included: Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,

3. Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

8. And all the villages that were near these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.

9. Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance.

10. The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was to Sarid:

11. Their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam.

12. It turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising to the border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goes out to Daberath, and goes up to Japhia,

13. From there it passed on along on the east to Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goes out to Remmon-methoar to Neah.

14. And the border goes around it on the north side to Hannathon: and it ends in the valley of Jipthah-el:

15. Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

16. This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.

17. The fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.

18. Their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

19. Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,

20. Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

21. Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez;

22. The coast reaches to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Beth-shemesh; and the border ended at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.

23. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.

24. The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.

25. Their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,

26. Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;

27. It turned toward the sun rising to Beth-dagon, and reached Zebulun, and to the valley of Jipthah-el toward the north side of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,

28. Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, to great Zidon;

29. The boundary turned to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and then the boundary turned to Hosah; it ended at the sea near Achzib.

30. Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.

31. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.

32. The sixth lot came to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.

33. Their boundary was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum; and it ended at Jordan.

34. Then the boundary turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goes from there to Hukkok, and reaches to Zebulun on the south side, and reaches to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

35. The fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

36. Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

37. Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,

38. Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

39. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.

40. The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.

41. The boundary of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,

42. Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

43. Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

44. Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

45. Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,

46. And Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

47. The boundary of the children of Dan went too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, put it to the sword and occupied it. They lived there and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.

48. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.

49. When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their boundaries, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:

50. According to the word of Jehovah they gave him the city that he requested, Timnathserah on mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and lived there.

51. These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they finished dividing the country.

## Joshua 20

1. Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying:

2. Speak to the children of Israel and say: »Designate cities of refuge just as Moses directed.

3. »Anyone who kills someone accidentally and unintentionally may go there for a refuge from the avenger of blood.

4. »When you flee to one of these cities you must go to the place of judgment at the entrance to the city, and explain to the leaders what happened. Then they will let you into the city and give you a place to live in, so that you can stay there.

5. »If the one looking for revenge follows you there, the people of the city must not hand you over to that one. They must protect you because you killed the person accidentally and not out of anger.

6. »You may stay in the city until you have received a public trial and until the death of the man who is then the High Priest. Then you may go back home to your own town, from which you had run away.«

7. So, on the west side of the Jordan River they set aside Kedesh in Galilee, in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim and Hebron, in the hill country of Judah.

8. East of the Jordan, on the desert plateau east of Jericho, they chose Bezer in the territory of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead, in the territory of Gad; and Golan in Bashan, in the territory of Manasseh.

9. These were the cities of refuge chosen for all the people of Israel and for any foreigner living among them. Any who killed a person accidentally could find protection there from the one looking for revenge. They could not be killed unless they had first received a public trial.

## Joshua 21

1. The leaders of the Levite families went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of all the tribes of Israel.

2. There at Shiloh in the land of Canaan they said to them: »Jehovah commanded through Moses that we were to be given cities to live in, as well as pasture land around them for our livestock.«

3. So in accordance with Jehovahs command the people of Israel gave the Levites cities and pasturelands out of their own territories.

4. The families of the Levite clan of Kohath were the first to be assigned cities. The families who were descended from Aaron the priest were assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.

5. The rest of the clan of Kohath was assigned ten cities from the territories of Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh.

6. The clan of Gershon was assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and East Manasseh in Bashan.

7. The families of the clan of Merari were assigned twelve cities from the territories of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.

8. By drawing lots, the people of Israel assigned these cities and their pasturelands to the Levites, as Jehovah commanded through Moses.

9. These are the names of the cities from the territories of Judah and Simeon.

10. These were given to the descendants of Aaron who were of the clan of Kohath and who were descended from Levi. Their assignment was the first to be made.

11. They were given the city of Arba. Arba was Anaks father. Arba is now called Hebron. It is in the hill country of Judah, along with the pastureland surrounding it.

12. The fields that were in the city and its towns had already been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.

13. In addition to Hebron, one of the cities of refuge, the following cities were assigned to the descendants of Aaron the priest: Libnah,

14. Jattir, Eshtemoa,

15. Holon, Debir,

16. Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh, with their pasturelands: nine cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon.

17. From the territory of Benjamin they were given four cities: Gibeon, Geba,

18. Anathoth, and Almon, with their pasturelands.

19. Thirteen cities in all, with pasturelands, were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.

20. The other families of the Levite clan of Kohath were assigned some cities from the territory of Ephraim.

21. They were given four cities: Shechem and its pasture lands in the hill country of Ephraim, one of the cities of refuge, Gezer,

22. Kibzaim, and Beth Horon, with their pasturelands.

23. From the territory of Dan they were given four cities: Eltekeh, Gibbethon,

24. Aijalon, and Gathrimmon, with pasturelands.

25. From the territory of West Manasseh they were given two cities: Taanach and Gathrimmon, with pasturelands.

26. These families of the clan of Kohath received ten cities in all, with pasturelands.

27. Another group of Levites, the clan of Gershon, received from the territory of East Manasseh two cities: Golan in Bashan, one of the cities of refuge, and Beeshterah, with pasturelands.

28. From the territory of Issachar they received four cities: Kishion, Daberath,

29. Jarmuth, and Engannim, with pasturelands.

30. From the territory of Asher they received four cities: Mishal, Abdon,

31. Helkath, and Rehob, with pasturelands.

32. From the territory of Naphtali they received three cities: Kedesh in Galilee, with pasture lands, one of the cities of refuge, Hammoth-Dor, and Kartan, with pasturelands.

33. The families of the clan of Gershon received a total of thirteen cities with pasturelands.

34. The rest of the Levites, the clan of Merari, received from the territory of Zebulun four cities: Jokneam, Kartah,

35. Dimnah, and Nahalal, with pasturelands.

36. From the territory of Reuben they received four cities: Bezer, Jahaz,

37. Kedemoth, and Mephaath, with pasturelands.

38. From the tribe of Gad they received four cities: Ramoth in Gilead, with pasturelands, one of the cities of refuge, Mahanaim,

39. Heshbon, and Jazer, with pasturelands.

40. The clan of Merari was assigned a total of twelve cities.

41. From the land that the people of Israel possessed, a total of forty-eight cities, with the pasturelands around them, was given to the Levites.

42. Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it.

43. Jehovah gave to Israel all the land that he had solemnly promised their ancestors he would give them. They took possession of it and settled down there.

44. Jehovah granted them peace throughout the land. This is just as he had promised their ancestors. Not one of all their enemies was able to stand against them, because Jehovah gave the Israelites the victory over all their enemies.

45. Jehovah kept every one of the promises he made to the people of Israel.

## Joshua 22

1. Joshua called together the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh.

2. He said: »You have done everything Jehovahs servant Moses ordered you to do. You have obeyed all my commands.

3. »You have never deserted the other Israelites. You have been careful to obey the commandments of Jehovah your God.

4. »Jehovah your God has given the other Israelites peace as he promised. So go back home to the land you claimed for your own, the land on the east side of the Jordan, that Moses, Jehovahs servant, gave you.

5. »Be sure you obey the Law that Moses commanded you. Love Jehovah your God. Do his will. Obey his commandments and be faithful to him. Serve him with all your heart and with all your being Nephesh: living being.«

6. Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way.

7. To the one half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but he gave the other half to Joshua among their brothers on this side Jordan westward. Joshua sent them a way to their tents and he blessed them.

8. He said: »Return with much riches to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.«

9. So the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh went back home. They left the rest of the people of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and started out for their own land, the land of Gilead, which they had taken as Jehovah commanded them through Moses.

10. The children of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manassah built a large altar by the borders of Jordan in the land of Canaan.

11. The children of Israel heard that the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar in the land of Canaan on the side belonging to the sons of Israel, at the Jordan when they passed by.

12. When the people of Israel heard this, the whole community came together at Shiloh to go to war against the eastern tribes.

13. Then the people of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh in the land of Gilead.

14. Ten leading men went with Phinehas, one from each of the western tribes and each one the head of a family among the clans.

15. They came to the land of Gilead, to the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh,

16. Speaking for the whole assembly of Jehovahs people they said: »Why have you done this evil thing against the God of Israel? You have rebelled against Jehovah by building this altar for yourselves! You are no longer following him!

17. »Do you remember our sin at Peor, when Jehovah punished his own people with an epidemic? We are still suffering because of that. Was that not enough sin?

18. »Are you going to refuse to follow him now? If you rebel against Jehovah now, he will be angry with everyone in Israel.

19. »If your land is not fit to worship in, come over into Jehovahs land, where his Tabernacle is. Claim some land among us. But do not rebel against Jehovah or make rebels out of us by building an altar in addition to the altar of Jehovah our God.

20. »Remember how Achan son of Zerah would not obey the command about the things condemned to destruction. The whole assembly of Israel was punished for that. Achan was not the only one who died because of his sin.

21. »The people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh answered the heads of the families of the western tribes:

22. »The Mighty, Divine One is God of Gods! He is Jehovah! The Mighty, Divine One is God of Gods! He is Jehovah! He knows why we did this, and we want you to know too! If we rebelled and did not keep faith with Jehovah, do not allow us to live any longer!

23. »If we disobeyed Jehovah and built our own altar to burn sacrifices on or to use for grain offerings or fellowship offerings, let Jehovah himself punish us.

24. »No! We did it because we were afraid that in the future your descendants would say to ours: What do you have to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?

25. »He made the Jordan a boundary between the people of Reuben and Gad and us. You have nothing to do with Jehovah. Then your descendants might make our descendants stop worshiping Jehovah.

26. »We did not built an altar to burn sacrifices or make offerings,

27. but instead, as a sign for our people and yours, and for the generations after us, that we do indeed worship Jehovah. We do this before his sacred Tabernacle with our offerings to be burned and with sacrifices and fellowship offerings. This was to keep your descendants from saying that ours have nothing to do with Jehovah.«

28. »We thought that if this should ever happen, our descendants could say: You see our ancestors made an altar just like Jehovahs altar. It was not for burning offerings or for sacrifice, but as a sign for our people and yours.«

29. We would certainly not rebel against Jehovah or stop following him now by building an altar to burn offerings on or for grain offerings or sacrifices. We would not build any other altar than the altar of Jehovah our God that stands in front of the Tabernacle of his presence.

30. Phinehas the priest and the ten leading men of the community with him, the heads of families of the western tribes, heard what the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh had to say, and they were satisfied.

31. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to them: »We know that Jehovah is with us. You have not rebelled against him. So you have saved the people of Israel from Jehovahs punishment.«

32. Phinehas and the leaders left the people of Reuben and Gad in the land of Gilead and went back to Canaan, to the people of Israel, and reported to them.

33. The Israelites were satisfied and praised God. They no longer talked about going to war to devastate the land where the people of Reuben and Gad had settled.

34. The people of Reuben and Gad said: »This altar is a witness to all of us that Jehovah is God. Therefore they named it witness.«

## Joshua 23

1. Later Jehovah gave Israel security from their enemies all around. By that time Joshua was very old.

2. He called all Israel, the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of the people, and said: »I am very old now.

3. »You have seen everything Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you. Jehovah your God fights for you.

4. »I have assigned as the possession of your tribes the land of the nations that are still left, as well as of all the nations that I have already conquered, from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.

5. »Jehovah your God will make them retreat from you. He will drive them away as you advance. You will possess their land, as Jehovah your God promised you.

6. »Be careful to obey and do everything that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses. Do not neglect any of it.

7. »You will not associate with these peoples left among you or speak the names of their gods or use those names in taking vows or worship those gods or bow down to them.

8. »Remain faithful to Jehovah, as you have been until now.

9. »Jehovah has driven great and powerful nations from before you. No one has ever been able to stand against you.

10. »One of you can make a thousand men run away, because Jehovah your God is fighting for you, as he promised.

11. »Take heed of yourselves to love Jehovah your God.

12. »If you are disloyal and join with the nations that are still left among you and intermarry with them,

13. »Jehovah your God will no longer drive these nations out as you advance. Rather, they will be as dangerous for you as a trap or a pit and as painful as a whip on your back or thorns in your eyes. This will last until none of you are left in this good land that Jehovah your God gave you.

14. »It is time for me to die. Every one of you knows in his heart and very being that Jehovah your God has given you all the good things he promised. Every promise he made has been kept; not one has failed.

15. »Just as he kept every promise that he made to you, so he will carry out every threat.

16. »If you do not obey the covenant Jehovah your God commanded you to obey and if you serve and worship other gods, then in his anger he will punish you. Soon none of you will be left in this good land that he gave you.«

## Joshua 24

1. Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem. He called the elders, the leaders, the judges, and the officers of Israel, and they came to the presence of God.

2. Joshua said to all the people: »This is what Jehovah, the God of Israel says: Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods. One of those ancestors was Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor.

3. »I took Abraham, your ancestor, from the land across the Euphrates and led him through the whole land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac,

4. and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Edom as his possession, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.

5. »Later I sent Moses and Aaron, and I brought great trouble on Egypt. I led you out.

6. »I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and cavalry. When your ancestors got to the Red Sea

7. they cried out to me for help. I put darkness between them and the Egyptians. I made the sea come rolling over the Egyptians and drown them. You know what I did to Egypt. You lived in the desert a long time.

8. »I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the east side of the Jordan. They fought you, but I gave you victory over them. You took their land. I destroyed them as you advanced.

9. »The king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, fought against you. He sent word to Balaam son of Beor and asked him to put a curse on you.

10. »But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you, and in this way I rescued you from Balak.

11. »You crossed the Jordan and traveled to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. I gave you victory over all of them.

12. »You advanced and I threw them into panic in order to drive out the two Amorite kings. Your swords and bows had nothing to do with it.

13. »I gave you a land that you had never worked and cities that you had not built. Now live there and eat grapes from vines that you did not plant, and olives from trees that you did not plant.

14. »Honor Jehovah and serve him sincerely and in truth. Get rid of the gods that your ancestors used to worship in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve only Jehovah.

15. »If you are not willing to serve him, decide today whom you will serve, the gods your ancestors worshiped in Mesopotamia or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living. As for my family and me, we will serve Jehovah.«

16. The people replied: »We would never leave Jehovah to serve other gods!

17. »Jehovah our God brought our fathers and us out of slavery in Egypt. We saw the miracles he performed. He kept us safe wherever we went among all the nations through which we passed.

18. »As we advanced to this land, Jehovah drove out all the Amorites who lived here. We also will serve Jehovah. He is our God!«

19. Joshua said to the people: »You may not be able to serve Jehovah. He is a holy God and will not forgive your sins. He will tolerate no rivals,

20. and if you leave him to serve foreign gods, he will turn against you and punish you. He will destroy you, even though he was good to you before.«

21. The people said to Joshua: »No! We will serve Jehovah!«

22. Joshua replied: »You are your own witnesses to the fact that you have chosen to serve Jehovah.« They said: »We are witnesses!«

23. »Remove the foreign gods you have.« He demanded: »Pledge your loyalty to Jehovah, the God of Israel.«

24. The people said to Joshua: »We will serve Jehovah our God. We will obey his commands.«

25. Joshua made a covenant for the people that day at Shechem. He gave them laws and rules to follow.

26. Joshua wrote these commands in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak tree in Jehovahs sanctuary.

27. He told the people: »This stone will serve as our witness. It has heard all the words that Jehovah spoke to us. So it will be a witness against you, to keep you from rebelling against your God.«

28. Joshua sent the people away, and everyone returned to their own part of the land.

29. After that, Jehovahs servant Joshua son of Nun died at the age of a hundred and ten.

30. They buried him on his own land at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.

31. As long as Joshua lived, the people of Israel served Jehovah. After his death they continued to do so as long as those leaders were alive who had seen for themselves everything Jehovah had done for Israel.

32. The body of Joseph, which the people of Israel had brought from Egypt, was buried at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver. Josephs descendants inherited this land.

33. Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, the town in the hill country of Ephraim that had been given to his son Phinehas.
