# 2 Samuel

## 2 Samuel 1

__(Writers: Gad and Nathan) (1040 B.C.E.)__

1. Saul was dead. David defeated the Amalekites and returned to Ziklag.

2. Three days later a soldier came from Sauls army. His clothes were torn and dirt was on his head. He knelt down in front of David.

3. David asked: »Where did you come from?« The man answered: »I escaped from Israels army.«

4. »How did the battle go?« David asked. The man said: »Our army turned and ran. Many were wounded and died. King Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.«

5. David asked: »How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?«

6. He answered: »I was on Mount Gilboa. I saw Saul leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry of the enemy closed in on him.

7. »He looked my way and called me. I said: Yes here I am.«

8. »He asked: Who are you. I told him I was an Amalekite.

9. »Then he said: Come here and kill me! I am badly wounded and about to die.

10. »I went up to him and killed him. I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm. Here, I have brought them to you.«

11. David and all his men tore their clothes in sorrow.

12. They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel, the people of Jehovah, because so many had been killed in battle.

13. David asked the young man who brought him the news: »Where are you from?« He answered: »I am an Amalekite, son of a foreign resident.«

14. David asked: »Why were you not afraid to take it upon yourself to destroy Jehovahs anointed king?«

15. David called one of the young men and said: »Execute him!« So he struck him and he died.

16. David said to him: »Your blood is on your head. Your mouth has testified against you. For you admit that you killed Jehovahs anointed.«

17. Then David chanted with a lament dirgerequiem over Saul and Jonathan his son.

18. He told them to teach the sons of Judah the song of the bow. It is written in the book of Jashar:

19. »Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!

20. »Do not tell the news in Gath. Do not announce the victory in the streets of Ashkelon. The daughters of the Philistines will be glad. The daughters of godless men will celebrate.

21. »Let no rain or dew fall on the mountains of Gilboa. Let its fields be barren! For the shields of the mighty lie there in disgrace. The shield of Saul is no longer polished with oil.

22. »Jonathans bow was deadly. The sword of Saul was without mercy. He struck down the mighty and killed the enemy.

23. »It was easy to love Saul and Jonathan. Together in life, together in death, they were faster than eagles and stronger than lions.

24. »Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul. He clothed you in scarlet with luxury.

25. »The brave soldiers have fallen. They were killed in battle. Jonathan lies dead in the hills.

26. »I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan. You were dear to me! How wonderful was your love for me. It was better than the love of women.

27. »The mighty have fallen, their weapons abandoned and useless.«

## 2 Samuel 2

1. Later David asked Jehovah: »Shall I go to the towns of Judah?« »Yes,« Jehovah answered. »Which one?« David asked. »Hebron,« Jehovah told him.

2. David went to Hebron. He took his two wives: Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabals widow from Carmel with him.

3. He also took his men and their families. They settled in the towns around Hebron.

4. Then the men of Judah came to Hebron. They anointed David as king of Judah. David heard that the people of Jabesh-gilead Jabesh in Gilead buried Saul.

5. He sent some men there with the message: »Jehovah blesses you for showing your loyalty to your king by burying him.

6. »May Jehovah always show you kindness. I also will be good to you because you did this.

7. »Be strong and courageous. Your master Saul is dead. Therefore the tribe of Judah has anointed me to be their king.«

8. Ners son Abner, commander of Sauls army, took Sauls son Ishbosheth and brought him to Mahanaim.

9. Abner made him king of Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin, that is, all Israel.

10. Sauls son Ishbosheth was forty years old when he became king of Israel. He ruled for two years. However the tribe of Judah followed David.

11. In Hebron David was king over the tribe of Judah for seven years and six months.

12. One time Abner and the soldiers of Ishbosheth left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.

13. At that time Joab the son of Zeruiah was leading Davids soldiers. The two groups met at the pool in Gibeon. Abner and his men sat down on one side of the pool and Joab and his men sat on the other side.

14. Abner yelled to Joab: »Let some of our best soldiers get up and fight each other!« Joab agreed.

15. Twelve of Ishbosheths men from the tribe of Benjamin got up to fight twelve of Davids men.

16. Each one grabbed his opponent by the head. Then he stuck his sword into his opponents side, and they fell down together. That place in Gibeon is called the Field of Enemies.

17. Fierce fighting broke out that day. In the end, Davids men defeated Abner and the men of Israel.

18. Zeruiahs three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast on his feet as a wild gazelle.

19. So Asahel started chasing Abner. He ran straight for him.

20. Abner looked behind and asked: »Are you Asahel?« He answered: »I am.«

21. Abner said: »Soldiers are all around us. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill him and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.« But Asahel refused to stop.

22. Abner spoke again to Asahel: »If you do not turn back, I will have to kill you! Then I could never face your brother Joab again.«

23. However, Asahel would not turn back. So Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of his spear. The spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahel fell down and died. Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped and stood still.

24. Joab and Abishai ran after Abner. It was sun down when they arrived at the hill of Ammah. This hill is near Giah on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon.

25. The men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They became united as one and stood on the top of a hill.

26. Then Abner called to Joab: Must the sword devour forever? Do you not understand it will be bitter to the end? How long before you command the people to return from chasing their brothers?

27. Joab said: »As God lives; if you had not spoken the men would have continued following their brothers.«

28. So Joab blew a rams horn and all the troops stopped. They did not chase or fight Israel anymore.

29. That night Abner and his men marched through the plains. They crossed the Jordan River and passed through the entire Bithron until they came to Mahanaim.

30. Joab returned from chasing Abner. He gathered the troops. Nineteen of Davids officers and Asahel were missing.

31. Davids men killed three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin under Abners command.

32. They buried Asahel in his fathers tomb in Bethlehem. Joab and his men marched all night. They arrived at Hebron at daybreak.

## 2 Samuel 3

1. There was a long war between the royal families of Saul and David. Davids family became stronger and stronger. Sauls family became weaker and weaker.

2. Sons were born to David while he was in Hebron. His first son was Amnon, born to Ahinoam from Jezreel.

3. The second was Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, Nabals widow from Carmel. The third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur.

4. The fourth son was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.

5. The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah. All of these sons were born in Hebron.

6. The fighting continued between Davids forces and the forces loyal to Sauls family. Abner became more and more powerful among Sauls followers.

7. Saul had a concubine named Rizpah. She was Aiahs daughter. Ishbosheth asked Abner: »Why did you have sex with my fathers concubine?«

8. Ishbosheths question made Abner very angry. »Am I a dog that belongs to Judea?« He asked. »Until now I have been faithful to your father Sauls family, to his relatives and friends. I did not hand you over to David. But now you charge me with a crime because of this woman.

9. »May God deal with me harshly if I do not help David get all that Jehovah promised him when he said:

10. »I Jehovah will transfer the kingship from Sauls family and establish Davids throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.«

11. Ishbosheth could not respond to a single word for he was afraid of Abner.

12. Abner sent messengers to David to speak on his behalf. »Who owns this country?« He asked. »Make an agreement with me,« he said. »Then I will support you and bring all Israel to you.«

13. »Good!« David answered. »I will make an agreement with you. But there is one condition: You may not come to see me unless you bring Michal, Sauls daughter, when you come.«

14. David sent messengers to Ishbosheth to give him this message: »Give me back my wife Michal! I bought her for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.«

15. Ishbosheth sent some of his men to take Michal away from her new husband, Paltiel son of Laish.

16. Paltiel followed Michal and the men all the way to Bahurim. He cried all the way. But he went back home after Abner ordered him to leave.

17. Meanwhile, Abner communicated with the leaders of Israel: »For some time now you wanted to make David your king.

18. »Do it now! This is what Jehovah said about David: I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and all their other enemies through my servant David.«

19. Abner also spoke to the people of Benjamin. Then Abner went directly to David in Hebron. He told him everything Israel and the entire tribe of Benjamin had approved.

20. Twenty men accompanied Abner to see David at Hebron. David had a feast for Abner and his men.

21. Abner told David: »I must go now so that I can gather all Israel for you, Your Majesty. They will make an agreement with you. You will rule over all that your heart desires.« Then David dismissed Abner, who left peacefully.

22. Just then Davids men and Joab came home from a raid with a lot of plunder. Abner had been dismissed, so he was no longer with David in Hebron.

23. Joab came back with the whole army. He was told: »Ners son Abner came to the king. However David dismissed him and Abner left peacefully.«

24. Joab went to the king and asked: »What have you done? Abner came to see you. Why did you send him away?

25. »Surely you know that he came to deceive you. He came to find out everything you do and everywhere you go.«

26. Joab left David. Then he sent messengers to get Abner, and they brought him back from Sirah Well. David knew nothing about it.

27. Abner arrived in Hebron. Joab took him aside at the gate, as though he wanted to speak privately with him. There he stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner was murdered because he had killed Joabs brother Asahel.

28. When David heard the news, he said: »Jehovah knows that my subjects and I are completely innocent of the murder of Abner.

29. »Let the punishment for it fall on Joab and all his family! In every generation may there be some man in his family who has gonorrhea or a dreaded skin disease or is fit only to do a womans work or is killed in battle or does not have enough to eat!«

30. Joab and his brother Abishai took revenge and murdered Abner for killing their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.

31. David told Joab and everyone with him: »Show your sorrow by tearing your clothes and wearing sackcloth! Walk in front of Abners body and cry!« David walked behind the coffin on which Abners body was being carried.

32. Abner was buried in Hebron. David and everyone else stood at the tomb and cried loudly.

33. The king sang a funeral song for Abner: »Should Abner die like a godless fool?«

34. »Your hands were not bound. Your feet were not in fetters. You fell as one falls in front of wicked men. And all the people continued to cry for him.«

35. David refused to eat anything the day of the funeral even though people tried to persuade him to eat. David vowed: »May God strike me dead if I taste any food or anything else before the sun goes down.«

36. All the people understood and approved of everything the king did.

37. That day all the people of Israel knew the king was not responsible for killing Ners son Abner.

38. The king told his officers: »Do you not know that today a leader, a great man, has fallen in Israel?

39. »Today, even though I am the anointed king, these men, Zeruiahs sons, are too strong for me to control. May Jehovah repay these wicked men, as their evil deed deserves.«

## 2 Samuel 4

1. Sauls son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron. He lost his courage, and all Israel was alarmed.

2. Sauls son had two men who were captains of raiding parties. One was named Baanah, and the other was named Rechab. They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth from the tribe of Benjamin. Beeroth was considered a part of Benjamin.

3. The people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim. They still live there today.

4. Sauls son Jonathan had a son who was crippled. When the boy was five years old, the news about the death of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled to Gittaim. She was in a hurry when she left. He fell from her arms and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.

5. Rechab and Baanah went to Ishbosheths house at the noontime. It was a hot day, and he was resting.

6. They came to the middle of the house pretending to get wheat. Once they were inside they stabbed Ishbosheth in the stomach and killed him.

7. They cut off his head and took his head with them. They traveled by way of the Arabah all night.

8. They took the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, »Here is the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. Jehovah has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.«

9. David responded to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth:

10. »I once seized a man who told me that Saul had died. He thought he was bringing good news. I killed him in Ziklag to reward him for his news.

11. »How much more should I reward wicked men who kill an innocent man on his own bed in his home? Jehovah has rescued me from every trouble. I solemnly swear, as Jehovah lives, I will now seek revenge for his murder and rid the land of you.«

12. David gave the order for his soldiers to kill Rechab and Baanah and cut off their hands and feet. They killed them and hung their hands and feet near the pool in Hebron. They took Ishbosheths head and buried it in Abners tomb there at Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 5

1. All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said to him: »We are your own flesh and blood.

2. »For a long time when Saul was still our king, you led the people of Israel in battle. Jehovah promised you that you would lead his people and be their ruler.«

3. All the elders of Israel came to King David at Hebron. He made a sacred alliance with them. They anointed him, and he became king of Israel.

4. David was thirty years old when he became king. He ruled for forty years.

5. In Hebron he ruled Judah for seven years and six months. In Jerusalem he ruled for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.

6. The king and his men went to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived in that region. The Jebusites told David: »You will never get in here. Even the blind and the lame could turn you away. In other words he could not enter there.«

7. However, David captured the fortress Zion, that is, the City of David.

8. That day David said: »Whoever wants to defeat the Jebusites must reach the lame and the blind that hate me by using the water tunnel.« So there is a saying: »The blind and the lame will not get into the palace.«

9. David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built the city of Jerusalem around it from the stronghold citadel to the palace.

10. David continued to grow more powerful because Jehovah God of Hosts was with him.

11. King Hiram of Tyre sent some officials to David. Carpenters and stone workers came with them. They brought cedar logs so they could build a palace for David.

12. David knew that Jehovah made him king of Israel and that he had made him a powerful ruler for the good of his people.

13. David left Hebron and moved to Jerusalem. He married many women from Jerusalem, and he had a lot of children.

14. The following are the names of his sons born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

15. Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,

16. Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.

17. The Philistines heard that David was now king of Israel. They mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David found out and went into his fortress.

18. So the Philistines camped in Rephaim Valley.

19. David asked Jehovah: »Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?« Jehovah answered David: »Attack! I will certainly deliver the Philistines to you.«

20. David went to Baal Perazim and defeated the Philistines. He said: »Jehovah has overwhelmed my enemies in front of me like an overwhelming flood.« That is why that place is called Baal Perazim Master of Breaking Through

21. The Philistines left their idols there. David and his men carried them all away.

22. The Philistines again attacked and overran the valley of Rephaim.

23. Once again David consulted Jehovah. Jehovah answered David: »Do not attack them from here. Go around and get ready to attack them from the other side, near the balsam trees.

24. »Attack when you hear the sound of marching in the treetops. I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army.«

25. David did what Jehovah commanded. He drove the Philistines back from Geba all the way to Gezer.

## 2 Samuel 6

__UZZAH GRABS ARK__

1. Once again David called together the best soldiers in Israel, a total of thirty thousand men.

2. He led them to Baalah in Judah, in order to bring the Ark of the Covenant bearing the name of Jehovah of Hosts, whose throne is above the winged creatures.

3. They took it from Abinadabs home on the hill and placed it on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the cart.

4. Ahio walked in front.

5. David and all the Israelites danced and sang with all their might to honor Jehovah. They played harps, lyres, drums, tambourines, rattles, and cymbals.

6. As they came to the threshing place of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Ark of the Covenant.

7. At once Jehovah God became angry with Uzzah. He killed him because of his irreverence. Uzzah died there beside the Ark of the Covenant.

8. Because of that the place has been called Perez Uzzah breakthrough of Uzzah ever since. David was furious because Jehovah punished Uzzah in anger.

9. Then David was afraid of Jehovah and said: »How can I take the Ark of the Covenant with me now?«

10. So he decided not to take it with him to Jerusalem. Instead, he turned off the road and took it to the house of Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath.

11. The Ark of Jehovah stayed at the home of Obed Edom from Gath for three months. Jehovah blessed Obed Edom and his whole family.

12. King David was told: »Jehovah has blessed Obed Edoms home and everything he owns because of the Ark of God.« Then David joyfully went to get the Ark of God from Obed Edoms house and bring it to the City of David.

13. When those who carried the Ark of Jehovah walked six steps, David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.

14. Wearing a linen ephod, David danced in Jehovahs presence with all his might.

15. He and the entire nation of Israel brought the Ark of Jehovah with shouts of joy and the sounding of rams horns.

16. When the Ark of Jehovah came to the City of David, Sauls daughter Michal looked out of a window and saw King David leaping and dancing in Jehovahs presence. She despised him in her heart.

17. The men carrying the Ark set it in its place inside the tent David put up for it. David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in Jehovahs presence.

18. David finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings. Then he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts.

19. He also distributed to all the people, to the whole crowd of Israelites, men and women, one loaf of bread, one date cake, and one raisin cake. Then all the people went home.

20. David went home so he could ask Jehovah to bless his family. But Sauls daughter Michal went out and started yelling at him: »You were really great today!« She said. »You acted like a dirty old man. You danced around half-naked in front of your servants slave-girls.«

21. David answered: »I danced to honor Jehovah. He chose me to be king instead of your father and his family. He made me the leader of his people Israel. I will continue to dance and honor Jehovah.

22. »I will disgrace myself even more. You may think I am nothing, but those women think highly of me!«

23. Michal, Sauls daughter, never had any children.

## 2 Samuel 7

1. King David was settled in his palace. Jehovah kept him safe from all his enemies.

2. The king said to the prophet Nathan: »I live in a house built of cedar. Yet the Ark of God is kept in a tent!«

3. Nathan answered: »Do what you have in mind. Jehovah is with you.«

4. That night Jehovah said to Nathan,

5. »Go tell my servant David that I say to him: You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in.

6. »From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now, I have never lived in a temple. I have traveled around living in a tent.

7. »In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders that I appointed why they had not built me a temple made of cedar.«

8. »Say this to my servant David: This is what Jehovah of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture where you followed sheep so that you could be the leader of my people Israel.

9. »I was with you wherever you went. I destroyed all your enemies in front of you. I will make your name famous like the names of the greatest people on earth.

10. »I will make a place for my people Israel and plant them there. They will dwell in their own place and not be troubled anymore. The wicked will not oppress them as they used to do

11. when I let judges rule my people. I have kept your enemies from attacking you. Now I promise that you and your descendants will be kings.

12. »I will choose one of your sons to be king when you reach the end of your life and are buried in the tomb of your ancestors. I will make him a strong ruler.

13. »I will allow no one to take his long lasting kingdom away from him. He will be the one to build a temple for me.

14. »I will be his father. He will be my son. When he does wrong I will correct him just as parents correct children.

15. »I will never put an end to my agreement with him. I put an end to my agreement with Saul when he was king before you.

16. »I will make sure that one of your descendants will be king for a very long time. Your throne will be established from generation to generation.«

17. Nathan told David exactly what he heard in the vision.

18. David went into the tent he set up for the ark. Then he sat there and prayed: »Jehovah All-Powerful, my family and I do not deserve what you have already done for us.

19. »Yet this was insignificant in your eyes, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah for you have spoken also of your servants house in the distant future. And this is the law for man, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.

20. »What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.

21. »For the sake of your Word and according to your will you have done this great thing. You have made it known to your servant!

22. »For this reason you are great, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah. There is none like you. There is no God besides you according to all that we have heard with our ears.

23. »There is no other nation on earth like Israel. This is the nation you rescued from slavery in Egypt to be your own. You became famous by using great and wonderful miracles to force other nations and their gods out of your land, so your people could live here.

24. »You chose Israel to be your people from generation to generation! You have become their God.

25. »And now, Jehovah God, please do what you have promised.

26. »You will be famous for a very long time! Everyone will say: »Jehovah of Hosts rules Israel. Davids descendants are his chosen kings.

27. »Now therefore, may it please you to bless the house of your servant that it may continue a long time before you. You O Lord Jehovah have spoken. May the house of your servant be blessed from generation to generation.

28. »Lord Jehovah, you are God. You have promised me some very good things, and you can be trusted to do what you promise.

29. »Please bless my descendants and let them be your chosen kings for a very long time. You have already promised, and I am sure that you will bless my family from generation to generation.«

## 2 Samuel 8

1. King David attacked the Philistines again. He defeated them and ended their control over Methegammah.

2. He defeated the Moabites. He made the prisoners lie down on the ground and put two out of every three of them to death. So the Moabites became his subjects and paid taxes to him.

3. David defeated the king of the Syrian state of Zobah, Hadadezer son of Rehob. Hadadezer was on his way to restore his control over the territory by the upper Euphrates River.

4. David captured seventeen hundred of his cavalry and twenty thousand of his foot soldiers. He kept enough horses for a hundred chariots and crippled hamstrung all the rest.

5. The Syrians of Damascus sent an army to help King Hadadezer. David attacked it and killed twenty-two thousand men.

6. Then he set up military camps in their territory. They became his subjects and paid taxes to him. Jehovah made David victorious everywhere.

7. David captured the gold shields carried by Hadadezers officials and took them to Jerusalem.

8. King David also took a large quantity of copper from Betah and Berothai, Hadadezers cities.

9. Soon King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated Hadadezers entire army.

10. He sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer. There had often been war between Hadadezer and Toi. Joram brought articles of gold, silver, and copper with him.

11. King David dedicated these articles to Jehovah, along with the silver and gold he dedicated from all the nations he conquered.

12. These nation included: Edom, Moab, Ammon, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the goods taken from Zobahs King Hadadezer, son of Rehob.

13. David made a name for himself by killing eighteen thousand Edomites in the Dead Sea region as he returned to Jerusalem.

14. He put troops everywhere in Edom. All the Edomites were Davids subjects. Everywhere David went Jehovah gave him victories.

15. So David ruled all Israel. He did what was fair and right for all his people.

16. Joab the son of Zeruiah was the commander in chief of the army. Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud kept the government records.

17. Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abiathar the son of Ahimelech, were the priests. Seraiah was the secretary.

18. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was the commander of Davids bodyguard. Davids sons were priests.

## 2 Samuel 9

1. One day, David thought: »I wonder if any of Sauls family is still alive. If they are I will be kind to them. This is because I made a promise to Jonathan.«

2. There was a servant of Sauls family named Ziba. He was told to go to David. »Are you Ziba?« The king asked. »I am at your service.« He answered.

3. The king asked him: »Is there anyone left of Sauls family to whom I can show loyalty and kindness? I promised God I would.« Ziba answered: »There is still one of Jonathans sons. He is crippled.«

4. »Where is he?« The king asked. Ziba answered: »At the home of Machir son of Ammiel in Lodebar.«

5. King David sent for him.

6. Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul arrived. He bowed down before David in respect. David said: »Mephibosheth.« He answered: »I am here to serve.«

7. David replied: »Do not be afraid. I will be kind to you for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will give you back all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul. You will always be welcome at my table.«

8. Mephibosheth bowed again and said: »I am no better than a dead dog! Why should you be so good to me?«

9. The king called Ziba, Sauls servant, and said: »I am giving Mephibosheth, your masters grandson, everything that belonged to Saul and his family.

10. »You, your sons, and your servants will farm the land for your master Sauls family and bring in the harvest. This will provide food for them. Mephibosheth will always be a guest at my table.« Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

11. Ziba answered: »I will do everything Your Majesty commands.« So Mephibosheth ate at the kings table, just like one of the kings sons.

12. Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. Everyone who lived at Zibas home became Mephibosheths servant.

13. Mephibosheth was disabled. He lived in Jerusalem. He always ate at the kings table.

## 2 Samuel 10

1. Later the king of Ammon died. His son Hanun became king in his place.

2. David thought: »I will show kindness to Hanun since his father Nahash showed me kindness.« David sent his servants to comfort Hanun after his fathers death. When Davids servants entered Ammonite territory,

3. the Ammonite princes asked their master Hanun: »Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent men to comfort you? Perhaps David sent his men to explore the city, spy on it, and destroy it.«

4. Hanun seized Davids men and shaved off half of each mans beard. He cut off their clothes from the waist down, and sent them away.

5. David was told what happened. He sent someone to meet them because they were deeply humiliated. The king said to them: »Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back. Then return to Jerusalem.«

6. The Ammonites realized they had made themselves repulsive to David. They hired the Arameans from Beth Rehob and Zobah, with twenty thousand foot soldiers. From the army of the king of Maacah they hired one thousand men, and twelve thousand men of Tob.

7. After David heard about this, he sent Joab and all the elite troops.

8. The Ammonites formed a battle line at the entrance of the city gate. The Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah remained by themselves in the open country.

9. Joab saw he was under attack in front and behind. He took the select troops of Israel and organized them for combat against the Arameans.

10. He put his brother Abishai in command of the rest of the army and had them fight the Ammonites.

11. Joab told his brother: »If the Arameans are too much for me to handle, you can come and help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will come and help you.

12. »Be brave and fight hard to protect our people and the cities of our God. I pray that Jehovah will do whatever pleases him.«

13. Joab and his men advanced to attack the Syrians. The Syrians retreated.

14. The Ammonites saw the Syrians Arameans running away. They fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab turned back from fighting the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem.

15. The Syrians knew they had been defeated by the Israelites. They called all their troops together.

16. King Hadadezer sent for the Syrians Arameans who were on the east side of the Euphrates River. They came to Helam under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah.

17. David heard of it. So he gathered the Israelite troops and crossed the Jordan River. They marched to Helam, where the Syrians took up their position facing him. The fighting began,

18. and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven hundred Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry. They wounded Shobach, the enemy commander, who died on the battlefield.

19. As soon as the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, they made peace with them and became their subjects. The Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites any more.

## 2 Samuel 11

__DAVID AND BATHSHEBA COMMIT ADULTERY__

1. In the spring, at the time of the year when kings usually go to war, David sent out Joab with his officers and the Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged the city of Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem.

2. Late one afternoon, David got up from his nap and went to the palace roof. He walked around on the roof. He saw a woman taking a bath. She was very beautiful.

3. He sent a messenger to find out who she was. He learned that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.

4. So David sent messengers to get her. She came to him and they had sexual intercourse. She had just cleansed herself after her monthly period. Then she went home.

5. The woman became pregnant. So she sent someone to tell David that she was pregnant.

6. David sent a messenger to Joab, saying: »Send me Uriah the Hittite.« So Joab sent Uriah to David.

7. When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the troops were and how the war was going.

8. »Go home,« David said to Uriah, »and wash your feet.« Uriah left the royal palace, and the king sent a present to him.

9. But Uriah slept at the entrance of the royal palace among his superiors mercenaries. He did not go home.

10. Someone told David that Uriah did not go home. So the next morning David asked him: »Why did you not go home? Have you been away for a long time?«

11. Uriah answered: »The Ark of the Covenant and the armies of Israel and Judah are camping out somewhere in the fields with our commander Joab and his officers and troops. Do you think I would go home to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? I swear by your life that I would not!«

12. David said: »Stay here in Jerusalem and I will send you back tomorrow.« Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day.

13. David invited him for dinner. Uriah ate with David and drank so much that he got drunk. However he still did not go home. He went out and slept on his mat near the palace guards.

14. The next morning, David wrote a letter and told Uriah to deliver it to Joab.

15. The letter said: »Put Uriah on the front line where the fighting is the worst. Pull the troops back from him, so that he will be wounded and die.«

16. Joab carefully watched the city of Rabbah. He put Uriah in a place where he knew there were some of the enemys best soldiers.

17. The men of the city came out and fought Joab. Some of Davids mercenaries fell and died. This included Uriah the Hittite.

18. Joab sent a messenger to report to David all the details of the battle.

19. And he commanded the messenger: »When you finish telling the king about the battle,

20. the king may become angry. He might ask you: Why did you go so close to the city to fight? Did you not know they would shoot from the wall?

21. »Who killed Jerubbesheths son Abimelech? Did a woman on the wall of Thebez throw a small millstone at him and kill him? Why did you go so close to the wall? If the king asks this, tell him: Your man Uriah the Hittite is also dead.«

22. The messenger left. When he arrived he reported to David everything Joab told him to say.

23. The messenger said to David: »Their men overpowered us when they came to attack us in the field. Then we forced them back to the entrance of the city gate.

24. »The archers on the wall shot down at your mercenaries. Some of Your Majestys mercenaries died. Your man Uriah the Hittite also is dead.«

25. David replied: »This is what you are to say to Joab: Do not let this thing trouble you. After all a sword can kill one person as easily as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and destroy it. Say this to encourage him.«

26. Uriahs wife heard that her husband was dead and she mourned for him.

27. When her mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to his home. She became his wife. Then she gave birth to a son. However, Jehovah considered Davids actions evil.

## 2 Samuel 12

__DAVID REPENTS__

1. Jehovah sent Nathan to David. Nathan came to him and said: »There were two men in a certain city. One was rich and the other was poor.

2. »The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle.

3. But the poor man had only one little female lamb that he bought. He raised her, and she grew up in his home with his children. She would eat his food and drink from his cup. She rested in his arms and was like a daughter to him.

4. »Now, a visitor came to the rich man. The rich man thought it would be a pity to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler. So he took the poor mans lamb and prepared it for the traveler.«

5. David became very angry with the rich man. He said: »I swear by the living God Jehovah that the man who did this should die!

6. »For doing such a cruel thing he should pay back four times for the lamb he took, for he had no compassion.«

7. »You are that man!« Nathan said to David. »And this is what the Lord Jehovah the God of Israel says: I made you king of Israel and rescued you from Saul.

8. »I gave you his kingdom and his wives. Then I made you king over Israel and Judah. If this had not been enough, I would have given you twice as much.

9. »Why have you disobeyed my commands? Why did you do this evil thing? You had Uriah killed in battle! You let the Ammonites kill him. Then you took his wife!

10. »In every generation some of your descendants will die a violent death because you have disobeyed me and have taken Uriahs wife.

11. »I swear to you that I will cause someone from your own family to bring trouble to you. You will see it when I take your wives from you and give them to another man. He will have intercourse with them in broad daylight.

12. »You did this secretly. I will make this happen in broad daylight in front of all Israel.«

13. David said to Nathan: »I have sinned against Jehovah.« Nathan replied: »Jehovah has taken away your sin. You will not die.

14. »You have shown total contempt for Jehovah by this affair. Therefore the son that is born to you must die.«

15. Nathan went home. Jehovah struck the child that Uriahs wife had given birth to David. The child became sick.

16. David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and lay on the ground all night.

17. The elders in his palace stood beside him to raise him up from the ground. But he was unwilling and he would not eat with them.

18. On the seventh day the child died. Davids servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. They thought: »While the child was alive, we talked to him, and he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may harm himself.«

19. David saw that his servants were whispering to one another. He realized discerned that the child was dead. »Is the child dead?« David asked them. »Yes, he is dead.« They answered.

20. David got up from the floor. He took a bath, combed his hair, and changed his clothes. Then he went and worshiped in the Temple of Jehovah. After that he returned to the palace and ate.

21. »We do not understand,« his servants said, »while the child was alive you would not eat. As soon as he died, you got up and ate!«

22. David replied: »I fasted and cried while the child lived. I thought Jehovah might be gracious to me and let the child live.

23. »Why should I fast now that he is dead? Can I bring him back? Someday I will go to him. However he will not come back to me.«

24. David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to bed with her, and she later gave birth to a son. David named him Solomon. Jehovah loved the child.

25. He sent a message through the prophet Nathan to name the baby Jedidiah Jehovahs Beloved.

26. Meanwhile, Joab fought against the Ammonite city of Rabbah and captured its royal fortress.

27. He sent messengers to tell David: »I fought against Rabbah and captured the fortress guarding its water supply.

28. »Assemble the rest of the troops. Surround the city and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city. Then it will be named after me.«

29. David assembled the rest of the army and attacked Rabbah. He captured the city.

30. He removed the crown of their god Milcom from off the head of their king. The crown was made of seventy-five pounds of gold. There was a valuable jewel on it. David put the jewel on his own crown. He also carried off everything else of value.

31. David made the people of Rabbah tear down the city walls with iron picks and axes. He also put them to work making bricks. He did the same thing with all the other Ammonite cities. David went back to Jerusalem. The people of Israel returned to their homes.

## 2 Samuel 13

__TAMAR VIOLATED__

1. David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar. She was Absaloms sister. She was also the half sister of Amnon. Amnon fell in love with her.

2. Tamar was a virgin. Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick.

3. Amnon had a friend named Jonadab. He was the son of Davids brother Shimeah. Jonadab usually knew how to get what he wanted.

4. Jonadab said to Amnon: »You are the kings son. Even so day after day I see you looking sad. What is the problem?« Amnon answered: »I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my half brother Absalom.«

5. Jonadab said: »Pretend that you are sick and go to bed. When your father comes to see you, say to him: Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me. I want her to fix the food here where I can see her. Then she can serve it to me.«

6. So Amnon went to bed and pretended that he was sick. King David went to see him. Amnon said: »Please have Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her. Then she can serve them to me.«

7. David sent word to Tamar at the palace: »Go to Amnons house and fix him some food.«

8. She went there and found him in bed. She prepared dough and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes.

9. Tamar emptied them out of the pan for him to eat. But he refused to eat. He said: Send everyone away. So they all left.

10. He said to her: »Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me.« She took the cakes and went over to him.

11. She offered them to him. He grabbed her and said: »Come to bed with me!«

12. She said: »No! Do not force me to do this disgraceful thing. It is evil.

13. »How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you, you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please speak to the king. I am sure he will give me to you.«

14. Amnon wouldnt listen to her. He grabbed his sister and raped her.

15. After that Amnon developed an intense hatred for her. His hatred for her was greater than the lust he felt for her. »Get out of here,« he told her.

16. She said: »No, You do a greater wrong by sending me away than the other thing you did to me!« He would not listen to her.

17. He called his servant and said: »Throw this woman out and lock the door!«

18. The servant forced her to leave. He locked the door behind her. The kings unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves.

19. Tamar tore the robe she was wearing. She put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands. She cried loudly as she walked away.

20. Tamars brother Absalom said to her: »How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he is your brother, do not tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.« Tamar soon moved into Absaloms house. She was always sad and lonely.

21. King David heard what happened and he was furious!

22. Absalom hated Amnon so much because he raped his sister Tamar. He would not speak to him anymore.

23. Two years later Absalom had sheep sheared at Baal Hazor, near the town of Ephraim. He invited all the kings sons to be there.

24. He went to King David and said: »Your Majesty, I am having my sheep sheared. Will you and your officials take part in the festivities?«

25. The king answered: No, my son. It would be too much trouble for you if we all went. Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in. So he asked Absalom to leave.

26. Absalom said: »Will you at least let my brother Amnon come? Why should he?« The king asked.

27. Absalom insisted until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king.

28. Absalom gave an order to his servants: »Watch now and when Amnon begins to feel good from drinking too much wine, I will tell you, Attack Amnon. Then kill him. Do not be afraid. I give this order. Be strong and courageous.«

29. Absaloms servants did to Amnon as Absalom ordered. Then all the kings sons got up, mounted their mules, and fled.

30. While they were on their way, David heard this rumor: »Absalom has killed all the kings sons, and not a single one is left.«

31. The king stood up and tore his clothes. Then he lay down on the ground. All his servants stood beside him with their clothes torn to show their grief.

32. Jonadab son of Davids brother Shimea, said: »Do not think that all the young men are dead. They have not killed all the kings sons. Only Amnon is dead. Absalom decided to do this the day his half brother raped his sister Tamar.

33. »You should not burden your heart with the idea that all the kings sons are dead. Your Majesty, only Amnon is dead.«

34. Absalom has fled. The servant keeping the watch looked outside. He saw many people coming down the road beside the mountain west of him.

35. Jonadab said: »Your Majesty, look! Here come your sons now, just as I told you.«

36. As soon as he finished speaking, the kings sons arrived. They cried loudly and the king and all his men also cried very bitterly.

37. David was sad for a long time because Amnon was dead.

38. Absalom ran away to Geshur. He stayed there for three years with King Talmai the son of Ammihud.

39. King David longed for Absalom once people had consoled him over Amnons death.

## 2 Samuel 14

1. Joab son of Zeruiah knew the king was still thinking about Absalom.

2. Joab sent someone to Tekoa to get a wise woman from there. He told her: »Please act like a mourner. Dress in mourning clothes. Do not use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for a long time.

3. »Go to the king and speak to him in this way.« Then Joab told her exactly what to say.

4. The woman from Tekoa came to the king. She immediately bowed down with her face touching the ground. »Help me, Your Majesty,« she said.

5. The king asked her: »What can I do for you?« She answered: »I am a widow; my husband is dead.

6. »I had two sons who fought with each other in the field. There was no one to separate them. One killed the other.

7. »All my relatives have turned against me and are demanding that I hand my son over to them. They want to kill him for murdering his brother. If they do this, I will be left without a son. They will destroy my last hope. They will leave my husband without a son to keep his name alive.«

8. The king responded: »Go back home. I will take care of the matter.«

9. »Your Majesty,« she said, »do whatever you must. My family and I will take the blame. You and the royal family are innocent.«

10. The king replied: »If someone threatens you, bring him to me. He will never bother you again.«

11. She said: »Please pray to Jehovah your God, Your Majesty, so that my relative who is responsible for avenging the death of my son will not commit a greater crime by killing my other son.« »I promise by the living Jehovah,« David replied, »your son will not be harmed.«

12. She added: »Your Majesty, May I say something?« »Yes,« he answered.

13. The woman said: »Have you been hurting Gods people? Your own son had to leave the country. When you judged in my favor, it was the same as admitting that you should have let him come back.

14. »We each must die and disappear like water poured out on the ground. But God does not take our lives. Instead, he figures out ways of bringing us back when we run away.

15. »Your Majesty, I came here to tell you about my problem. I was afraid of what someone might do to me. I decided to come to you, because I thought you could help.

16. »In fact, I knew that you would listen and save my son and me from those who want to take the land that God gave us.

17. »I can rest easy now that you have given your decision. You know the difference between right and wrong just like an angel of God. I pray that Jehovah your God will be with you.«

18. David said: »Now I ask you a question. Do not try to hide the truth!« The woman replied: »Please go ahead, Your Majesty.«

19. »Did Joab put you up to this?« The king asked. The woman answered: »I solemnly swear on your life, Your Majesty, you are absolutely right! Yes, your servant Joab ordered me to do this. He told me to say exactly what I said.

20. »Your servant Joab has done this to view this matter from a different angle. You are as wise as an angel of God messenger of God, who knows everything on earth.«

21. Later on the king said to Joab: »I have decided to do what you want. Go and get the young man Absalom and bring him back here.«

22. Joab quickly bowed down with his face touching the ground. He blessed the king. He said: »Today I know that you have been kind to me because you did what I wanted.«

23. Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.

24. The king said: »Absalom should return to his own house. Do not let him see me.« So Absalom returned to his house. He did not see the king.

25. No one in all Israel was praised for his good looks as much as Absalom was. He had no blemish from head to toe.

26. From time to time, he used to cut his hair because it became heavy for him. When he cut the hair on his head and weighed it, it weighed five pounds according to the kings standard.

27. Absalom had three sons and one daughter. His daughter Tamar was a beautiful woman.

28. Absalom stayed in Jerusalem two years without seeing the king.

29. So Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king. Joab refused to come. Absalom sent for him a second time. He still refused to come.

30. Finally, Absalom told his servants: »Joabs barley field is next to mine. Set it on fire!« So they set it on fire.

31. Joab went to Absaloms house and demanded: »Why have your servants set my field on fire?«

32. Absalom answered: »You did not pay any attention when I sent for you. I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur. I was better off there. I want to see my father now! If I am guilty, let him kill me.«

33. So Joab went to King David. He told him what Absalom said. The king sent for Absalom. He went to the king and bowed down to the ground in front of him. The king welcomed him with a kiss.

## 2 Samuel 15

1. Absalom provided a chariot and horses for himself. He had an escort of fifty men to run ahead of him.

2. He would rise early in the morning and stand by the road at the city gate. When someone came there with a dispute that he wanted the king to settle, Absalom would call him over and ask him where he was from. After the man told him what tribe he was from,

3. Absalom would say: »My friend, the law is on your side. However, there is no representative of the king to hear your case.«

4. He added: »How I wish I were a judge! Then anyone who had a dispute or a claim could come to me. I would give him justice.«

5. The man would approach Absalom and bow down before him. Then Absalom would reach out and hug and kiss him.

6. Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for judgment. That way he won their loyalty.

7. After four years Absalom said to King David: »My lord let me go to Hebron and keep a promise I made to Jehovah.

8. »When I lived at Geshur in Syria Aram, I promised Jehovah that if he would take me back to Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron.«

9. »Go in peace,« the king said. »So Absalom went to Hebron.«

10. He sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel. He told them: »When you hear the sound of trumpets, shout: Absalom is king in Hebron!«

11. Absalom had two hundred men who at his invitation traveled from Jerusalem with him. They knew nothing of the plot and went in good faith.

12. Absalom was offering sacrifices. He sent for Ahithophel, Davids adviser, to come from his home in Giloh. Meanwhile, the conspiracy grew stronger. The number of people siding with Absalom kept getting larger.

13. A messenger told David: »Absalom has the hearts of the people of Israel.«

14. David told all his men who were with him in Jerusalem: »We must run away quickly, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Leave right away or he will catch up to us and bring ruin upon us when he massacres the city.«

15. The kings servants told him: »No matter what happens, we are Your Majestys servants.«

16. The king left on foot. His whole household followed him. The king left ten concubines behind to take care of the palace.

17. The king and his troops left the city on foot. They stopped at the city limits.

18. All his mercenaries passed by him. The Cherethites, all the Pelethites, Ittai, and all six hundred men who had followed him from Gath marched past the king.

19. The king asked Ittai from Gath: »Why should you go with us? Go back, and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland.

20. »In fact you came to us just yesterday. Should I make you wander around with me when I do not even know where I am going? Go back and take your countrymen with you. May Jehovah always show you kindness.«

21. Ittai answered: »Your Majesty, I swear to you in the name of Jehovah that I will always go with you wherever you go, even if it means death.«

22. David answered: »That is fine. March on!« So Ittai went on with all his men and their dependents.

23. The people cried loudly as Davids followers left. The king crossed Kidron Brook. His men followed him. They went to the wilderness.

24. Zadok the priest was there. He had Levites there carrying the sacred Ark of God. They set it down and did not pick it up again until all the people left the city. The priest Abiathar was there too.

25. The king said to Zadok: »Take the Ark of the Covenant back to the city. If Jehovah is pleased with me he will let me come back to see it and the place where it stays.

26. »Let him do to me what he wishes if he is not pleased with me.«

27. He also said to Zadok: »You are a seer, are you? Take your son Ahimaaz and Abiathars son Jonathan and go back to the city in peace.

28. »I will wait at the river crossings in the wilderness until you send news.«

29. Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of the Covenant back into Jerusalem and stayed there.

30. David went up the slope of the Mount of Olives. He was barefoot and crying. He covered his head to show his sorrow. Everyone with him was crying. They covered their heads too.

31. Someone told David: »Ahithophel is helping Absalom conspire against you!« David said: »Please Jehovah keep Ahithophels plans from working!«

32. David reached the top of the Mount of Olives. He met Hushai the Archite at a place of worship. Hushais robe was torn, and dust was on his head.

33. David told him: »You might slow me down if you come with me.«

34. Go back into the city and tell Absalom: »Your Majesty, I am your servant. I will serve you just as I served your father in the past. Hushai, if you do that you can help me ruin Ahithophels plans.

35. »Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you. You can tell them everything you hear in the palace.

36. »Have them send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what you hear.«

37. Davids advisor Hushai slipped back into Jerusalem. Absalom came into the city at the same time.

## 2 Samuel 16

1. David started down the other side of the Mount of Olives. He met Ziba, the chief servant of Mephibosheth. Ziba had two donkeys that were carrying two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred figs, and some wine.

2. »What is all this?« David asked. Ziba said: »The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and fruit are for the people to eat. The wine is for them to drink in the desert when they are tired out.«

3. »Where is your master Sauls grandson?« The king asked. »He stayed in Jerusalem,« said Ziba. He said: »Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfathers kingdom.«

4. The king told Ziba: »In that case everything that belonged to Mephibosheth now belongs to you. I sincerely thank you,« said Ziba, »I hope to remain in your good graces, Your Majesty.«

5. King David arrived at Bahurim. A man who was a distant cousin of Saul came out cursing. His name was Shimei, son of Gera.

6. Shimei threw stones at David and his officials. This was in spite of the fact that his men and his bodyguards surrounded David.

7. Shimei cursed him and said: »Get out! Get out you murderer!

8. »You took Sauls kingdom. Now Jehovah is punishing you for murdering so many of Sauls family. Jehovah has given the kingdom to your son Absalom. You are ruined, you bloodthirsty murderer!«

9. Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king: »Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over there and cut off his head!«

10. »What business is this of yours?« The king said to Abishai and his brother Joab. »If Jehovah told him to curse me who am I to stop him?«

11. David said to Abishai and to all his officials: »My own son is trying to kill me. Why should you be surprised at this Benjaminite? Jehovah told him to curse. Leave him alone and let him curse.

12. »Perhaps Jehovah will acknowledge my misery and give me some blessings to take away this curse.«

13. David and his men continued along the road. Shimei kept up with them. He walked on the hillside. He cursed and threw stones and dirt at them as he went.

14. The king and all the people with him finally arrived at their destination and rested there.

15. Absalom and all Israels troops came to Jerusalem. Ahithophel was with him.

16. Davids friend Hushai from Archis family came to Absalom. He said: »Long live the king! Long live the king!«

17. »Is this how loyal you are to your friend?« Absalom asked Hushai. »Why did you not go with him?«

18. Hushai answered: »Jehovah and the people of Israel have chosen you to be king. I cannot leave. I must stay and serve the one they have chosen.

19. »After all it seems right for me to serve you, just as I served your father.«

20. Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said: »Give us your advice! What should we do?«

21. Ahithophel answered: »Some of your fathers wives were left here to take care of the palace. You should have sex with them. Then everyone will find out that you have publicly disgraced your father. This will make you and your followers even more powerful.«

22. They pitched a tent for Absalom on the palace roof. There in the sight of everyone Absalom went in and had intercourse with his fathers concubines.

23. Any advice that Ahithophel gave in those days was accepted as though it were the very word of God. David and Absalom followed it.

## 2 Samuel 17

1. Later Ahithophel said to Absalom: »Let me choose twelve thousand men. Tonight I will set out after David.

2. »I will attack him while he is tired and discouraged. He will be frightened! All his men will run away. I will kill only the king.

3. »Then I will bring back all his men to you. It will be like a bride returning to her husband. Kill one man and the rest of the people return safely.«

4. This seemed like good advice to Absalom and all the Israelite leaders.

5. Absalom said: »Bring in Hushai. Let us hear what he has to say about this.«

6. Hushai came to Absalom. He told him what Ahithophel planned. Then Absalom said: »Should we do what he says? If we should not, can you come up with something better?«

7. Hushai said: »This time Ahithophels advice is not very good.

8. »You know your father and his followers are mighty warriors. They are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars. He will not spend the night with the others.

9. »He has no doubt already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else. When people hear that some of your soldiers have been killed, everyone will think your entire army has been destroyed.

10. »Even the bravest man with a heart like a lion would lose his courage. All Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and the men with him are brave.

11. »My advice is to gather all Israels troops from Dan to Beersheba. They are as numerous as the sand on the seashore. Lead them into battle yourself.

12. »Find him and attack him! We will fall on him as dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.

13. »If he retreats into a city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city and drag it into a valley. Not even a pebble will be found there.«

14. Absalom and all the people of Israel said: »The advice of Hushai from Archis family is better than Ahithophels advice. Jehovah commanded Ahithophels good advice to be defeated in order to ruin Absalom.«

15. Hushai told the priests Zadok and Abiathar: »Ahithophel advised Absalom and the leaders of Israel to do one thing. But I advised them to do something else.

16. »Quickly send messengers to tell David: Do not rest tonight in the river crossings in the desert. Make sure you cross the river. Otherwise Your Majesty and all the troops with him will be wiped out.«

17. Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En Rogel. They could not risk being seen coming into the city. A servant girl was to go and tell them. They were to go and tell King David.

18. A young man saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and told Absalom. So both of them left quickly. They went to the home of a man in Bahurim who had a cistern in his courtyard. They climbed down into it.

19. The mans wife took a covering and spread it over the opening of the cistern. She scattered grain over it so that no one would notice anything.

20. Absaloms officials came to the house and asked the woman: »Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?« She answered: »They crossed the river. The men looked for them but could not find them. So they returned to Jerusalem.«

21. After they left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan came up out of the cistern. Then they reported to King David. They told him what Ahithophel planned against him. They said: »Hurry up and cross the river.«

22. So David and his men crossed the Jordan. By daybreak they had all gone across.

23. Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed. He saddled his donkey and went back to his hometown. He arranged his affairs in order and he hanged himself. He was buried in the family grave.

24. David went to the town of Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan River with the army of Israel.

25. Absalom put Amasa in Joabs place as commander of the army. Amasas father was Ithra from the family of Ishmael, and his mother was Abigal, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joabs mother Zeruiah.

26. The Israelites under Absaloms command set up camp in the region of Gilead.

27. David went to the town of Mahanaim. Shobi son of Nahash came from Rabbah in Ammon, Machir son of Ammiel came from Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite came from Rogelim.

28. Here is a list of what they brought: sleeping mats, blankets, bowls, pottery jars, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,

29. Also honey, yogurt, sheep, and cheese. They brought food for David and the others because they knew that everyone would be hungry, tired, and thirsty from being out in the desert.

## 2 Samuel 18

1. David called the troops that were with him. He appointed commanders in charge of regiments and battalions.

2. David assigned a third of the troops under Joabs command. He put another third under Joabs brother Abishai son of Zeruiah. Then he placed the last third under Ittai from Gath. »I am going into battle with you,« the king said to the troops.

3. »You must not go with us,« they answered. »It will not make any difference to the enemy if the rest of us turn and run. It will not matter even if half of us are killed. But you are worth ten thousand of us. It will be better if you stay here in the city and send us help.«

4. »I will do what you think best,« the king answered. Then he stood by the side of the gate as his men marched out in units of a thousand and of a hundred.

5. The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: »Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.« All the troops heard him give the commanders this order regarding Absalom.

6. So the troops went to the country to fight Israel in the forest of Ephraim.

7. Battles were fought all over the forest. Davids soldiers were winning. Twenty thousand soldiers were killed that day.

8. More soldiers died from the dangers of the forest than from the fighting.

9. Absalom happened to come face to face with some of Davids men. He was riding on a mule. The mule went under the tangled branches of a large tree. Absaloms head became caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair when the mule under him ran away.

10. A man who saw this told Joab: »I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.«

11. »What! You saw what?« Joab said. »Why did you not strike him to the ground? Then I would have felt obligated to give you four ounces of silver and a belt.«

12. The man told Joab: »Even if I felt the weight of twenty pounds of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the kings son. We heard the order the king gave you, Abishai, and Ittai. Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.

13. »Would you have stood by me if I did something treacherous to him? There is nothing hidden from the king. You would turn against me.«

14. »I will not waste any more time with you,« Joab said. He took three spears and plunged them into Absaloms chest while he was still alive and hanging in the oak tree.

15. Ten of Joabs soldiers closed in on Absalom and finished killing him.

16. Joab ordered the trumpet blown to stop the fighting. His troops came back from pursuing the Israelites.

17. They took Absaloms body and threw it into a deep pit in the forest. Then they covered it with a huge pile of stones. All the Israelites fled to their own hometowns.

18. During his lifetime Absalom built a monument for himself in Kings Valley. He had no son to keep his name alive. So he named it after himself. To this day it is known as Absaloms Monument.

19. Ahimaaz son of Zadok said: »Joab let me run and tell King David that Jehovah rescued him from his enemies.«

20. Joab answered: »You are not the one to tell the king his son is dead. You can take him a message some other time, but not today.«

21. Someone from Ethiopia was standing there. Joab told him: »Go tell the king what you have seen.« The man knelt down in front of Joab and then got up and started running.

22. Ahimaaz spoke to Joab again: »No matter what happens, I still want to run. The Ethiopian has already left.« Joab said: »Why should you run? You will not get a reward for the news you have!«

23. »I would like to run whatever happens, Let me run,« replied Ahimaaz. Joab told him: »Run!« So Ahimaaz ran along the valley road and got ahead of the Sudanese messenger.

24. David was sitting between the two gates. The watchman walked along the roof of the gate by the wall. He looked at the man running alone.

25. The watchman called and alerted the king. If he is alone, the king said, »He has good news to tell.« The runner came closer.

26. The watchman saw another man running. He called: »There is another man running alone.« The king said: »This one is also bringing good news.«

27. The watchman said: »It appears the first one runs like Ahimaaz, Zadoks son. Hes a good man,« the king said. »He must be coming with good news.«

28. Ahimaaz approached the king, greeted him, and bowed down in front of him. Ahimaaz said: »May Jehovah your God be praised. He has handed over the men who rebelled against Your Majesty.«

29. »Is the young man Absalom all right?« The king asked. Ahimaaz answered: »I saw a lot of confusion when Joab sent me away. I did not know what it meant.«

30. »Step aside, and stand here,« the king said. He stepped aside and stood there.

31. Then the Sudanese messenger came. Good news for Your Majesty! He said. Today Jehovah freed you from all who turned against you.

32. »Is the young man Absalom all right?« The king asked. The Sudanese messenger answered: »May your enemies and all who turned against you be like that young man!«

33. The king was shaken by the news. He went to the room above the gate and cried. »My son Absalom!« He said. »My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!«

## 2 Samuel 19

1. They brought Joab word. They said: »The king weeps and mourns for Absalom.«

2. Davids army found out he was crying because his son died. Suddenly their day of victory turned into a day of sadness.

3. The troops returned to Mahanaim without celebration. It was as if they ran away from battle and were ashamed.

4. David held his hands over his face and kept on crying loudly. »My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!«

5. Joab went to the house where David was staying and told him: »You have made your soldiers ashamed! They saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and wives as well.

6. »You are more loyal to your enemies than to your friends. You show your officers and soldiers that they do not mean a thing to you. You would be happy if Absalom was still alive even if the rest of us were dead.

7. »Now stand up! Go out there and thank them for what they did. If you do not, I swear by Jehovah you will not even have one man left on your side tomorrow morning. You may have had a lot of troubles in the past. But this will be the worst thing that has ever happened to you!«

8. The king sat in the gateway. The troops were told: »The king is sitting in the gateway.« So they went to the king. Meanwhile, Israel fled back to their homes.

9. All the people in all the tribes of Israel argued with one another. They said: »The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines. Now he has fled from Absalom and left the country.

10. »Absalom, whom we anointed to rule us, has died in battle. Why is no one talking about reinstating the king?«

11. What all Israel was saying reached the king at his house. So King David sent this message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar: »Ask the leaders of Judah, Why should you be the last tribe to reinstate the king back to his palace?

12. »You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. Why should you be the last to reinstate the king?«

13. »Say to Amasa: Are you my flesh and blood? May God strike me dead unless you are given Joabs place to serve me always as the commander of the army.«

14. All the people of Judah were in total agreement. So they sent the king this message: »Come back with all your servants.«

15. The king returned to the Jordan River. The people of Judah went to Gilgal to meet the king and bring him across the Jordan River.

16. Shimei son of Gera from the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Bahurim, hurried down with the people of Judah to meet King David.

17. One thousand people from Benjamin were with him. Ziba the servant of Sauls family rushed to the Jordan River across from the king. Ziba brought his fifteen sons and twenty servants.

18. They brought Davids family and servants back across the river. They did everything he wanted them to do. Shimei crossed the Jordan River and bowed down in front of David.

19. He said: »I beg you not to punish me! Please forget what I did when you left Jerusalem. Do not even think about it.

20. »I know I was wrong and have sinned. That is why I wanted to be the first one from the northern tribes to meet you.«

21. But Abishai shouted: »You should be killed for cursing Jehovahs chosen king!«

22. David exclaimed: »Abishai, what will I do with you and your brother Joab? Is it your job to tell me who has done wrong? I have been made king of all Israel today. No one will be put to death!«

23. David promised Shimei that he would not be killed.

24. Mephibosheth grandson of Saul also came to meet David. He missed David so much that he did not take a bath or trim his beard or wash his clothes the whole time David was gone.

25. They returned to Jerusalem. Mephibosheth came to see David. David asked him: »Why did you not go with me?«

26. He answered: »Your Majesty, you know I cannot walk. I told my servant to saddle a donkey for me so I could go with you. But my servant left without me.

27. »He told you lies about me. My lord the king is like an angel of God. Do what you think is right.

28. »You could have killed anyone in my entire family. Instead you seated me with those who eat at your table. I no longer have the right to complain to my lord the king.«

29. The king asked him: »Why do you keep talking about it? I said you and Ziba should divide the land.«

30. »Let him take it all,« Mephibosheth told the king. »It is enough for me that you have come home safely.«

31. Barzillai, the man from Gilead, came from Rogelim with the king to the Jordan River to send him on his way.

32. Barzillai was a very old man. He was eighty years old. He was very rich. He supplied the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim.

33. The king said to him: »Come with me to Jerusalem. I will take care of you.«

34. Barzillai answered: »I do not have long to live. Why should I go with Your Majesty to Jerusalem?

35. »I am already eighty years old. Nothing gives me pleasure any more. I cannot taste what I eat and drink. I cannot hear the voices of singers. I would only be a burden to my lord the king.

36. »I will cross the river with you. But I will only go a little way on the other side. You do not have to be so kind to me.

37. »Please let me return to my hometown. There I can someday be buried near my father and mother. My servant Chimham can go with you. You can treat him as your own.«

38. David said: »I will take Chimham with me. Whatever you ask me to do for him, I will do. If you want anything else I will do it.«

39. Davids soldiers went across the river. He stayed behind to tell Barzillai good-by and to wish him well. Barzillai returned home.

40. Chimham crossed the river with David. All of Judahs army and half of Israels army were there to help David cross the river.

41. All the people of Israel came to the king. They asked: »Why did our brothers, the people of Judah, kidnap you and bring you and your family across the Jordan River?«

42. All the people of Judah answered the people of Israel: »Because the king is our relative. Why are you angry about this? Did we eat the kings food, or did he give us any gifts?«

43. The Israelites replied: »We have ten times as many claims on King David as you have! We know he is one of you. Why do you look down on us? Do not forget that we were the first to talk about bringing the king back!« The men of Judah were more violent in making their claims than the men of Israel.

## 2 Samuel 20

1. A worthless character named Sheba son of Bikri lived at Gilgal. He was of the tribe of Benjamin. He blew the trumpet and called out: »Down with David! We will not follow him! Men of Israel, let us go home!«

2. The Israelites deserted David and went with Sheba. The men of Judah remained loyal and followed David from the Jordan to Jerusalem.

3. David left ten of his concubines in Jerusalem to take care of his palace. When he returned, he had them taken to another house. He placed soldiers there to guard them. He gave them what they needed. He never slept with any of them again. They had to live there for the rest of their lives as if they were widows.

4. David said to Amasa: »Three days from now I want you and all of Judahs army to be here!«

5. Amasa assembled the army of Judah. It took longer than three days.

6. David said to Abishai: »Sheba will hurt us more than Absalom ever did. Take my best soldiers and go after him. We do not want him to take over any walled cities and get away from us.«

7. Joabs men, the Cherethites, Pelethites, and all the soldiers went with Abishai. They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.

8. Amasa met them at the large rock in Gibeon. Joab wore a military uniform. He strapped a sword in a scabbard at his hip. He stepped forward and the sword dropped into his hand.

9. »How are you, my brother?« Joab asked Amasa. He took hold of Amasas beard with his right hand to kiss him.

10. Amasa was not on guard against the sword in Joabs left hand. Joab stabbed him in the stomach. Then he stabbed him in his intestines and they poured out on the ground. He died without being stabbed again. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri.

11. One of Joabs young men stood beside Amasa and said: »Those who favor Joab and are on Davids side should follow Joab.«

12. Amasas body was covered with blood in the middle of the road. Joabs man saw that everybody was stopped. He dragged the body from the road out into the field and threw a blanket over it.

13. After the body had been removed from the road, everyone followed Joab in pursuit of Sheba.

14. Sheba went through all of the tribes of Israel when he came to the town of Abel Beth-Maacah. His best soldiers met him there and followed him into the town.

15. Joab and his troops surrounded Abel, so no one could go in or come out. They made a dirt ramp rampart up to the town wall. Then they used a battering ram to knock the wall down.

16. A wise woman shouted from the top of the wall: »Hear this! Listen to me! I must talk to Joab! Tell him to come here!«

17. He came near. She asked: »Are you Joab?« »I am,« He answered. »Listen to what I have to say,« She told him. »I am listening,« He answered.

18. She said: »There is an old saying: Be sure to seek guidance from Abel before doing anything. That is the way they settle disputes.

19. »We are peaceful and faithful Israelites. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel? Why should you swallow up what belongs to Jehovah?«

20. Joab answered: »That is unthinkable! I do not wish to swallow it up or destroy it.

21. »That is not so. A man from the mountains of Ephraim by the name of Sheba son of Bichri has rebelled against King David. Give him to me and I will withdraw from the city.« The woman told Joab: »Watch, for his head will be thrown to you from the wall.«

22. She went to the people of the city with her plan. They cut off Shebas head and threw it over the wall to Joab. He blew the trumpet as a signal for his men to leave the city. They went back home. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.

23. Joab was in command of the army of Israel. Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of Davids bodyguards.

24. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records.

25. Sheva was the court secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.

26. And Ira, a descendant of Jair, was a priest to David.

## 2 Samuel 21

1. There was a famine for three successive years during Davids reign. David asked Jehovah for advice about it. Jehovah answered: »It is because of Saul and his family. They are guilty of murder because they killed the people of Gibeon.«

2. The Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were left over from the Amorites. The Israelites swore to spare them. Saul, in his eagerness, tried to destroy them for Israel and Judah. The king called the Gibeonites.

3. He asked them: »What can I do for you? What shall I give you to make peace with you so that you will bless what belongs to Jehovah?«

4. The Gibeonites responded: »Our quarrel with Saul and his family cannot be settled with silver or gold. We do not want to kill any Israelite.« What do you want me to do?« David asked.

5. They answered: »Saul wanted to destroy us and leave none of us alive anywhere in Israel.

6. »Hand over seven of his male descendants. We will hang them before Jehovah at Gibeah, the hometown of Saul, Jehovahs chosen king.« The king responded: »I will hand them over to you.«

7. David made a promise to Jonathan with Jehovah as his witness. He spared Jonathans son Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul.

8. Saul and Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had two sons named Armoni and Mephibosheth. Sauls daughter Merab had five sons whose father was Adriel the son of Barzillai from Meholah. David took Rizpahs two sons and Merabs five sons.

9. He turned them over to the Gibeonites. They hanged all seven of them on the mountain near the place where Jehovah was worshiped. This happened right at the beginning of the barley harvest.

10. Rizpah daughter of Aiah spread some sackcloth on a nearby rock. She would not let the birds land on the bodies during the day. She kept the wild animals away at night. She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until it started to rain.

11. The Philistines killed Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa and hung their bodies in the town square at Beth-Shan. The people of Jabesh in Gilead secretly took the bodies away. David found out what Sauls wife Rizpah did. So he went to the leaders of Jabesh to get the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan.

12. David took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. They had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shean, where the Philistines hung them the day they killed Saul at Gilboa.

13. David brought the bones of Saul and Jonathan. His men also gathered the bones of those who had been executed.

14. Then they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin, at Zela, in the tomb of Sauls father Kish. They did everything the king ordered. After that God answered the prayers for the land.

15. Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David and his men went to fight the Philistines. David became exhausted.

16. A descendant of Haraphah named Benob had a copper spear weighing seven and one half pounds. He wore it on a new belt. He captured David and intended to kill him.

17. Abishai son of Zeruiah came to Davids rescue. Abishai attacked the giant and killed him. Then Davids men made David promise that he would never again go out with them to battle. »You are the hope of Israel. We do not want to lose you!« They said.

18. After this there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Sibbecai from Hushah killed a giant named Saph a descendant of Rapha.

19. There was another battle with the Philistines at Gob. Elhanan son of Jair from Bethlehem killed Goliath from Gath. Goliaths spear had a shaft as thick as the bar on a weavers loom.

20. There was another war, this time in Gath. One of the enemy soldiers was a descendant of the Rephaim. He was as big as a giant and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.

21. When he challenged Israel, Jonathan, son of Davids brother Shimei, killed him.

22. These four were descendants of Haraphah from Gath. David and his men killed them.

## 2 Samuel 22

__DAVIDS SONG OF PRAISE__

1. David sang this song to Jehovah when Jehovah rescued him from all his enemies, especially from Saul.

2. He said: »Jehovah is my rock and my fortress. He is my Savior,

3. »My God, My rock in whom I take refuge. He is my shield, the strength of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge. He is my Savior who saved me from violence.

4. »Jehovah should be praised. I called on him and was saved from my enemies.

5. »The waves of death had surrounded me. The torrents of destruction had overwhelmed me.

6. »The danger of death was around me. The grave set its trap for me.

7. »I called to Jehovah in my trouble. I called to my God for help. In his temple he heard my voice. He listened to my cry for help.

8. »Earth shook and shivered! The columns supporting the sky rocked back and forth. You were angry.

9. »You breathed out smoke. Scorching heat and fiery flames spewed from your mouth.

10. »You opened the heavens like curtains. You came down with storm clouds under your feet.

11. »You rode on the angels as you flew. You soared on the wings of the wind.

12. »You surrounded yourself with darkness. You made the dark rain clouds your covers.

13. »Out of the brightness in front of you, you made lightning.

14. »Jehovah thundered from heaven. The Most High made his voice heard.

15. »You shot arrows and scattered them. You flashed bolts of lightning and confused them.

16. »Then the ocean floor could be seen. The foundations of the earth were laid bare at Jehovahs stern warning, at the blast of breath from your nostrils.

17. »You reached down from high above and took hold of me. You pulled me out of the raging water.

18. »You rescued me from enemies who were hateful and too powerful for me.

19. »When I was in trouble they attacked me. You O Sovereign Jehovah protected me.

20. »You helped me out of danger. You saved me because you were pleased with me.

21. »You Jehovah rewarded me because of my righteousness. Because my hands are clean you rewarded me.

22. »I have kept the ways of Jehovah. I have not wickedly turned away from my God.

23. »All your judgments are in front of me. I have not turned away from your laws.

24. »You know I am faultless. I have kept myself from doing wrong.

25. »You reward me because I do what is right. You know I am innocent.

26. »O Jehovah, you are faithful to those who are faithful to you, and completely good to those who are faultless.

27. »You are pure to those who are pure, but hostile to those who are wicked.

28. »You rescue the humble. You find ways to humiliate the proud.

29. »Jehovah our God, you are my lamp. You turn darkness into light.

30. »You help me run through armies and leap over city walls.

31. »Your way is perfect Jehovah. Your word is correct. You are a shield for those who run to you for help.

32. »Who is God but Jehovah? Who is a rock other than our God?

33. »God arms me with strength. Your perfect way sets me free.

34. »You make me sure-footed as a deer. You keep me safe on the mountains.

35. »You train me for battle, so that I can use the strongest bow.

36. »O Jehovah you protect me and save me. Your help has made me grow great multiply.

37. »You clear the way for me. I will not stumble.

38. »I chased my enemies until I caught them and destroyed them.

39. »I destroyed them! I stuck my sword through my enemies. They were crushed under my feet.

40. »You armed me and gave me strength to fight. You subdued and brought low those who came against me.

41. »By you they turn their backs and run. Those who hate me are silenced.

42. »They cried for help, but there was no help. They called to you Jehovah and you did not answer.

43. »They were crushed as small as the dust of the earth. I stamped them down under my feet like the waste of the streets.

44. »You rescued me from my stubborn people. You made me the leader of foreign nations. They are now my slaves.

45. »Foreigners obey and come crawling.

46. »Foreigners lose heart and are fearful in their fortresses.

47. »Jehovah lives! Blessed is my rock! May God, the rock of my salvation, be glorified.

48. »You, Jehovah, give me victory over my enemies! You subdue nations under me.

49. »You protect me from violent enemies. You made me greater than all of them.

50. »I will praise you, Jehovah, and I will honor you among the nations.

51. »You give glorious victories to your anointed king. Your faithful love for David and for his descendants will never end.«

## 2 Samuel 23

1. These are the last words of David: Here is the declaration by David, son of Jesse. The declaration by the man whom God raised up, whom the God of Jacob anointed, the singer of Israels psalms:

2. »The Spirit of Jehovah spoke through me. His word was on my tongue.

3. »The God of Israel has spoken. The protector of Israel said to me: The king who rules with justice, who rules in obedience to God.

4. »He is like the sun shining on a cloudless day. The sun that makes the grass sparkle after rain.

5. »That is how God will bless my descendants. He made an eternal covenant with me. It is an agreement that will not be broken, a promise that will not be changed. That is all I desire. That will be my victory, and God will surely bring it about.

6. »All the evildoers will be like thorns to be pushed away. They may not be gripped in the hand:

7. »But with a sharp spear. They are burned on the spot.«

8. These are the names of Davids warriors: Ishbosheth son of Hachmon was the leader of the Three Warriors. In one battle, he killed eight hundred men with his spear.

9. The next one of the Three Warriors was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite. One time when the Philistines were at war with Israel, he and David dared the Philistines to fight them. Every one of the Israelite soldiers turned and ran.

10. Eleazar was the exception. He killed Philistines until his hand was cramped. He could not let go of his sword. When Eleazar finished, all the Israelite troops had to do was come back and take the enemies weapons and armor. Jehovah gave Israel a great victory that day.

11. Next in rank to him was Shammah, the son of Agee from Harar. The Philistines had gathered at Lehi, where there was a field of ripe lentils. When the troops fled from the Philistines,

12. he stood in the middle of the field and defended it by killing Philistines. So Jehovah won an impressive victory.

13. At harvest time three of the thirty leading men came to David at the cave of Adullam when a troop from the Philistine army was camping in the valley of Rephaim.

14. David was on a fortified hill. A group of Philistines occupied Bethlehem.

15. David grew homesick. He said: »I wish someone would bring me a drink of water from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!«

16. The three famous soldiers forced their way through the Philistine camp. They then drew some water from the well, and brought it back to David. But he would not drink it. He poured it out as an offering to Jehovah.

17. David said: »Jehovah, I could never drink this! It would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives!« So he refused to drink it. Those were the brave deeds of the three famous soldiers.

18. Joabs brother Abishai led the Thirty Warriors. In one battle he killed three hundred men with his spear. He was as famous as the Three Warriors.

19. In fact he was just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. He was the commander of the Thirty Warriors. Yet he still did not become one of the Three Warriors.

20. Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave man from Kabzeel who did some amazing things. He killed two of Moabs best fighters. On a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.

21. He killed an Egyptian as big as a giant. The Egyptian was armed with a spear. Benaiah only had a club. Benaiah grabbed the spear from the Egyptian and killed him with it.

22. Benaiah never became one of the Three Warriors. He was just as famous as they were and certainly just as famous as the rest of the Thirty Warriors. David made him the leader of his bodyguard.

23. He was honored over the rest of the Thirty Warriors. But he was not equal to the first three. David made him in charge over the fighting men who kept him safe.

24. One of the thirty was Joabs brother Asahel. The thirty leading men were Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,

25. Shammah from Harod, Elika from Harod,

26. Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,

27. Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai son of Hushai,

28. Zalmon descendant of Ahohi, Maharai from Netophah,

29. Heleb son of Baanah from Netophah, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,

30. Benaiah from Pirathon, Hiddai from the Gaash ravines,

31. Abi Albon from Beth Arabah, Azmaveth from Bahurim,

32. Elihba from Shaalbon, Bene Jashen,

33. Jonathan son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,

34. Eliphelet son of Ahasbai and grandson of a man from Maacah, Eliam son of Ahithophel from Gilo,

35. Hezrai from Carmel, Paarai from Arabah,

36. Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani from the tribe of Gad,

37. Zelek from Ammon, Naharai from Beeroth, armorbearer for Zeruiahs son Joab,

38. Ira descendant of Ithra, Gareb descendant of Ithra,

39. and Uriah the Hittite, thirty-seven in all.

## 2 Samuel 24

1. Jehovah became angry at Israel again. He provoked David to turn against Israel. He said: »Go count the people of Israel and Judah.«

2. King David said to Joab the commander of the army: »Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and count the people. That way I will know how many there are.«

3. Joab answered reluctantly: »Your Majesty, may Jehovah your God make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now. May you live to see him do it. But why does Your Majesty want to do this?«

4. The king made Joab and his officers obey his order. They left his presence and went out to count the people of Israel.

5. They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer, the city in the middle of the valley, in the territory of Gad. Then they went north to Jazer.

6. They went to Gilead and to Kadesh in Syria. Then they went to Dan Dan-jaan, Ijon, and on toward Sidon.

7. They came to the fortress of Tyre. They went through every town of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Finally, they went to Beersheba in the Southern Desert of Judah.

8. After they went through the whole land, they went back to Jerusalem. It took them nine months and twenty days.

9. Joab told David: In Israel there is eight hundred thousand who can serve in the army. In Judah there are five hundred thousand.

10. After David had everyone counted, he felt guilty and told Jehovah: »What I did was stupid and terribly wrong. Jehovah, please forgive me.«

11. When David got up in the morning, Jehovah spoke his word to the prophet Gad, Davids seer.

12. »Go tell David: This is what Jehovah says: »I offer you three choices. Choose the one you want me to do to you.« «

13. Gad told David the three choices as follows: »Seven years of famine could come to you and your land. You could flee from your enemies as they pursue you for three months. Or there could be a three-day plague in your land? Think it over, and decide what answer I should give the one who sent me.«

14. »I am in a desperate situation,« David told Gad. »Please let us fall into Jehovahs hands because he is very merciful. But do not let me fall into human hands.«

15. So Jehovah sent a plague among the Israelites from that morning until the time he had chosen. Of the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand died.

16. When the angel stretched out his arm to destroy Jerusalem, Jehovah changed his mind about the disaster. »Enough!« He said to the angel who was destroying the people. »Put down your weapon.« The angel of Jehovah was at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

17. David saw the angel who had been killing the people. He said to Jehovah: »I have sinned. I have done wrong. What have these sheep done? Please let your punishment be against me and against my fathers family.«

18. Gad came to David and said: »Go, set up an altar for Jehovah at Araunah the Jebusites threshing floor.«

19. David obeyed Jehovahs command and went as Gad had told him to.

20. Araunah saw David and his soldiers coming toward him. He went over to David and bowed down low,

21. and said: »My lord the king! Why have you come to see me?« David answered: »I came to buy your threshing place. I have to build Jehovah an altar here, so this disease will stop killing the people.«

22. Araunah said: »Take what you want and offer your sacrifice. Here are some cattle for the sacrifice. You can use the threshing-boards and the wooden yokes for the fire.«

23. Araunah gave this to the king and said: »May Jehovah your God accept you.«

24. »No!« The king said to Araunah. »I must buy it from you at a fair price. I will not offer Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.« So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for one and one quarter pounds of silver.

25. David built an altar for Jehovah there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. So Jehovah heard the prayers for the country. The plague on Israel stopped.
