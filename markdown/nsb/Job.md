# Job

## Job 1

__(Writer: Moses) (Job means Object of Hostility) (1473 B.C.E.)__

1. A man named Job lived in Uz. He was a man of integrity! He was decent, he respected God, and he stayed away from evil.

2. He had seven sons and three daughters.

3. He owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, one thousand head of cattle, and five hundred donkeys. He also had a large number of servants. In fact he was the greatest richest of all the Orientals in the East!

4. Job's sons used to take turns giving a feast. They invited many others to come, and they always invited their three sisters to join them.

5. The morning after each feast, Job would get up early to offer sacrifices for each of his children in order to purify them. He always did this because he thought that one of them might have sinned by insulting God unintentionally.

6. The day came when heavenly beings appeared before Jehovah. Satan was there among them.

7. Jehovah asked him: »What have you been doing?« Satan answered: »I have been walking here and there and roaming around the earth.«

8. »Did you notice my servant Job?« Jehovah asked. »There is no one on earth as faithful and good as he is. He respects me and is careful not to do anything evil.«

9. Satan replied: »Would Job respect you if he got nothing out of it?

10. »You have always protected him and his family and everything he owns. You bless everything he does. You have given him enough cattle to fill the whole country.

11. »Now suppose you take away everything he has. He will curse you to your face!«

12. »All right,« Jehovah said to Satan, »everything he has is in your power, but you must not hurt Job!« So Satan left.

13. One day when Job's children were having a feast at the home of their oldest brother,

14. a messenger came running to Job. »We were plowing the fields with the cattle,« he said, »and the donkeys were in a nearby pasture.

15. »Suddenly the Sabeans attacked and stole them all. They killed every one of your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«

16. Before he finished speaking, another servant came and said: »Lightning struck the sheep and the shepherds and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«

17. Before he finished speaking, another servant came and said: »Three bands of Chaldean raiders attacked us. They took away the camels and killed all your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«

18. No sooner had he finished speaking, then another servant came and said: »Your children were having a feast at the home of your oldest son,

19. when a storm swept in from the desert. It blew the house down and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.«

20. Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief. He shaved his head and threw himself face down on the ground.

21. He said: »I was born with nothing naked, and I will die with nothing. Jehovah gave, and now he has taken away. Blessed be the name of Jehovah!«

22. In spite of everything that had happened, Job did not sin by blaming God.

## Job 2

1. One day when the sons of God came to present themselves in front of Jehovah, Satan the Accuser came along with them.

2. Jehovah asked Satan: »Where have you come from? Satan replied to Jehovah: From wandering all over the earth.«

3. Jehovah asked Satan: »Have you thought about my servant Job? No one in the world is like him! He is a man of integrity! He is decent and he respects God. He stays away from evil. And he still holds on to his principles. You are trying to provoke me into ruining him for no reason.«

4. Satan answered Jehovah: »Skin for skin! Certainly, a man will give everything he has for his life.

5. »But stretch out your hand, and strike his flesh and bones and he will curse you to your face!«

6. Jehovah told Satan: »He is in your power, but you must spare his life!«

7. Satan left Jehovahs presence and struck Job with painful boils from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head.

8. Job took a piece of broken pottery to scratch his sores as he sat in the ashes.

9. His wife asked him: »Are you still holding on to your principles? Curse God and die!«

10. He said to her: »You are talking like a godless fool. We accept the good that God gives us. Should we not also accept the bad?« Through all this Job did not speak sinful words.

11. Job's three friends heard about all the terrible things that happened to him. Each of them came from his home: Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah, and Zophar of Naama. They agreed they would go together to sympathize with Job and comfort him.

12. They saw him from a distance and did not even recognize him. They cried out loud and wept. Each of them tore his clothes in grief. They threw dust on their heads.

13. Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw that he was in such great pain.

## Job 3

1. JOB OPENED HIS MOUTH and cursed the day of his birth.

2. He said:

3. »May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said: A boy is born!«

4. »Let that day turn to darkness. May God above not care about it. Let no light shine upon it.

5. »Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it once more. May a cloud settle over it and may blackness overwhelm its light.

6. »About that night, may thick darkness seize it. May it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.

7. »Let the night be barren and may no shout of joy be heard in it.

8. »May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to lift up Leviathan Babylonian symbol of sadness and mourning.

9. »Let its morning stars become dark and cause it to wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,

10. for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.

11. »Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?

12. »Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?

13. »For now I would be lying down in peace. I would be asleep and at rest.

14. »I would be with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins.

15. »I would be with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.

16. »Why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?

17. »There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.

18. »Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave drivers shout.

19. »The small and the great are there. The slave is freed from his master.

20. »Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter in heart?

21. »They long for death that does not come. They search for it more than for hidden treasure.

22. »They are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave.

23. »Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged fenced in?

24. »Sighing comes to me instead of food. My groans pour out like water.

25. »What I feared has come upon me. What I dreaded has happened to me.

26. »I have no peace. I have no quietness. I have no rest. I only have turmoil!«

## Job 4

1. ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE REPLIED TO JOB:

2. »If someone tries to talk to you, will you become impatient? But who can keep from talking?

3. »Look, you have instructed many people. When hands were weak, you made them strong.

4. »When someone stumbled, you lifted him up with your words. When knees were weak, you gave them strength.

5. »But trouble comes to you, and you are impatient. It touches you, and you panic.

6. »Does your respect for God give you confidence and your lifetime of integrity give you hope?

7. »Now think about this: Which innocent person ever died an untimely death? Find me a decent person who has been destroyed.

8. »When I saw those who plowed wickedness and planted misery, they gathered its harvest.

9. »God destroys them with his breath and kills them with a blast of his anger.

10. »The roar of the lion and the growl of the ferocious lion are loud. The young lions have had their teeth knocked out.

11. »The old lions die without any prey to eat, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.«

12. Eliphaz of Teman continued: »I was told something secretly and heard something whispered in my ear.

13. »I am with disturbing thoughts from visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on people.

14. »Fear and trembling came over me, and all my bones shook.

15. »A spirit passed in front of me. It made my hair stand on end.

16. »Something stood there. I could not tell what it was. A vague image was in front of my eyes. I heard a soft voice say:

17. »Can any mortal be righteous to God? Can any human being be pure to his maker?

18. »You see God does not trust his own servants. He accuses his angels of making mistakes.

19. »How much more will he accuse those who live in clay houses that have their foundation in the dust? Those houses can be crushed quicker than a moth!

20. »From morning to evening, they are shattered. They will disappear forever without anyone noticing.

21. »Have the ropes of their tent been loosened? Will they die without wisdom?«

## Job 5

__ELIPHAZ CONTINUED__

1. »Cry out! Is there anyone to answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?

2. »To be sure anger kills a stubborn fool. And jealousy murders a gullible person.

3. »I have seen a stubborn fool take root and I quickly cursed his house.

4. »His children are far from help. They are crushed at the court of justice at the city gate. No one is there to rescue them.

5. »Hungry people eat what a stubborn fool gathers. They take it even from among the thorns. Thirsty people pant after his wealth.

6. »Affliction does not come from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.

7. »A person is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly up from a fire.

8. »As for me, I would seek God's help and present my case to him.

9. »He does great things that we cannot understand and miracles that we cannot count.

10. »He gives rain to the earth and sends water to the fields.

11. »He sets on high the lowly people. He lifts those who mourn to safety.

12. »He keeps shrewd craftycunning people from carrying out their plans so that they cannot do anything successfully.

13. »He catches the wise with their own craftiness. The plans of schemers are quickly halted.

14. »They meet in darkness in the daytime! In bright sunlight they grope as if it were night.

15. »He saves people from the sword slander of their mouth. He saves the needy from the power of the mighty.

16. »The poor have hope when wrongdoing shuts its mouth.

17. »Blessed is the person whom God corrects. Do not despise discipline from the Almighty.

18. »God inflicts wounds and he bandages. He strikes but his hands make you well.

19. »He will keep you safe from six troubles, and when the seventh one comes, no harm will touch you:

20. »In famine he will save you from death, and in war he will save you from the sword.

21. »You will be protected from the sharp tongue and you will not be afraid when destruction comes.

22. »You will laugh at destruction and starvation. You will not be afraid of wild beasts.

23. »You will have a binding agreement with the stones in the field, and wild animals will be at peace with you.

24. You will know peace in your tent. You will inspect your house and find nothing missing.

25. »You will find that your children are many and your descendants are like the grass of the earth.

26. »You will come to your grave at a very old age like a stack of hay in its season.

27. »We have studied all of this thoroughly! This is the way it is. Listen to it, and learn it for yourself.«

## Job 6

1. JOB ANSWERED:

2. »If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!

3. »It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas, no wonder my words have been impetuous.

4. »The Almightys arrows are in me. My spirit drinks in their poison. Gods terrors set themselves against me.

5. »Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?

6. »Is tasteless food eaten without salt? Is there flavor in the white root of the marshmallow plant or the white of an egg?

7. »I refuse to touch it! This repugnant food makes me ill.

8. »Oh, that I might have my request and that God would grant what I long for.

9. »Oh that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!

10. »Then I would still have this consolation, my joy in unrelenting pain, that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.

11. »What strength do I have, that I should wait and hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?

12. »Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh made of bronze?

13. »Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?

14. »A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes his reverence for the Almighty.

15. »But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow

16. when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,

17. but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanishes from their channels.

18. »Caravans turn aside from their routes. They go into the wasteland and perish.

19. »The caravans of Tema look for water. The traveling merchants of Sheba hope and wait in vain.

20. »They are distressed! They were once confident. They arrive there, only to be disappointed.

21. »Now you too have proved to be of no help. You see something dreadful and are afraid.

22. »Have I ever said: Give something on my behalf; pay a ransom for me from your wealth,

23. deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless?

24. »Teach me, and I will be quiet. Show me where I have been wrong.

25. »Honest words are so painful! But what do your arguments prove?

26. »Do you mean to correct what I say? Do you treat the words of a despairing man as wind?

27. »You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.

28. »But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?

29. »Relent and do not be unjust. Reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.

30. »Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern destructive malice?«

## Job 7

__JOB CONTINUED__

1. »Is this not the struggle of all humanity? A persons life is long and hard like that of a hired hand.

2. »It is like a worker who longs for the day to end, like a servant waiting to be paid.

3. »I am allotted months of futility, long and weary nights of misery.

4. »I go to bed and I think: »When will it be morning?« But the night drags on, and I toss till dawn.

5. »My skin is clothed with worms and scabs. My flesh breaks open filled with pus.

6. »My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle flying back and forth. They end without hope.

7. »O God, remember that my life is but a breath. I will never again see good.

8. »You see me now but not for long. Your eyes will be on me but I will be dead.

9. »Just as a cloud dissipates and vanishes; those who die will not come back.

10. »They are gone forever from their home. They will not be seen again.

11. »I will not keep from speaking. I must express my anguish. I must complain in my bitterness.

12. »Am I a sea monster that you place a guard on me?

13. »When I think: My bed will comfort me, and I will try to forget my misery with sleep,

14. you shatter me with dreams. You terrify me with visions.

15. »I would rather die of strangulation than go on and on like this.

16. »I hate my life. I do not want to go on living. Oh, leave me alone for these few remaining days.

17. »What is man that you should magnify him and set your mind on him?

18. »For you examine us every morning and test us every moment.

19. »How long will you keep looking at me and let me alone till I swallow my spittle?

20. »Have I sinned? What have I done to you, O watcher of all humanity? Why have you made me your target? Am I a burden to you?

21. »Why not just pardon my sin and take away my guilt? For soon I will lie down in the dust and die. When you look for me, I will be gone.«

## Job 8

1. BILDAD THE SHUHITE SPOKE:

2. »How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.

3. »Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?

4. »When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the power of their sin.

5. »But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,

6. if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.

7. »Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.

8. »Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned.

9. »After all we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are a mere shadow.

10. »Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?

11. »Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?

12. »While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.

13. »Such is the destiny of all who forget God. The hope of the godless will perish.

14. »What he trusts in is fragile and what he relies on is like a spiders web.

15. »He leans on his web, but it gives way! He clings to it, but it does not hold.

16. »He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.

17. »It entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.

18. »When it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says: I never saw you.

19. »Its life withers away and other plants grow from the soil.

20. »Certainly God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.

21. »He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.

22. »Your enemies will be clothed in shame. The tents of the wicked will be no more.«

## Job 9

1. JOB RESPONDED:

2. »Truly I know it is so, but how can a man be righteous before God?

3. »If one wished to argue with God, he could not answer or respond to him once in a thousand times.

4. »God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against him and prospered?

5. »He removes the mountains, and they do not know when he overturns them in his anger!

6. »He shakes the earth out of its place and its pillars tremble.

7. »He commands the sun and it does not rise! He seals off the stars.

8. »He alone spreads out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.

9. »He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades and the chambers of the south.

10. »He does great things beyond our understanding, yes, marvelous wonders without number.

11. »He goes by me and I do not see. He moves past and I do not perceive him.

12. »He takes away and who can hinder God? Who can say to God: What are you doing?

13. »God will not withdraw his anger. The allies of the proud lie thrown down beneath him.

14. »How then can I answer God and choose my words in order to reason with him?

15. »Though I was righteous, I could not answer him! I would beg mercy of my Judge.

16. »If I called and he answered me, I would not believe that God was listening to my voice.

17. »He crushes me with a tempest. He multiplies my wounds without cause.

18. »He will not allow me to catch my breath. Yet he fills me with bitterness.

19. »If I speak of strength and justice, he is strong! Who will appoint my day in court?

20. »Though I was righteous, my own mouth would condemn me. If I were blameless it would prove me perverse.

21. »I am blameless! Yet I do not know myself. And I despise my life.

22. »It is all one thing. Therefore I say: God destroys the blameless and the wicked.

23. »If the scourge slays suddenly, God laughs at the plight of the innocent.

24. »The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not God, who else could it be?

25. »My days are swifter than a runner! They flee away and see no good.

26. »They pass by like swift ships, like an eagle swooping on its prey.

27. »If I say: I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,

28. »I am afraid of all my suffering and I know that God will not hold me innocent.

29. »If I am condemned, why then do I labor in vain?

30. »If I wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands with soap,

31. »Yet you will plunge me into the pit, and my own clothes will abhor me.

32. »God is not a man, as I am: That I may answer him and we should go to court together.

33. »Nor is there any mediator between us who may lay his hand on us both.

34. »Let God remove his rod from me. Do not let dread of him terrify me.

35. »I would speak and not respect God. But I cannot do this!

## Job 10

__JOB CONTINUED__

1. »I loathe my very life. I will therefore give free rein to my complaint and speak out in my bitterness.

2. »I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.

3. »Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?

4. »Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a man sees?

5. »Are your days like those of a mortal or are your years like those of a man?

6. »Must you search out my faults and probe after my sin?

7. »You know that I am not guilty and that no one can force me from your hand!

8. »Your hands formed me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?

9. »Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?

10. »Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,

11. clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?

12. »You granted me life and showed me kindness. Your providence preserved my spirit.

13. »Yet this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:

14. »If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.

15. »If I am wicked, woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and aware of my affliction.

16. »If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.

17. »You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me. Your forces come against me wave upon wave.

18. »Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before anyone saw me.

19. »If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!«

20. »Are not my days few in number? Turn away from me so I can have a moments joy

21. before I go to the place of no return, to the land of darkness and the shadow of death,

22. to the land of dark night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.«

## Job 11

1. ZOPHAR THE NAAMATHITE REPLIED:

2. »Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?

3. »Should your idle talk reduce men to silence? Should no one rebuke you when you mock?

4. »You say to God: My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.

5. »How I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you

6. and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.

7. »Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?

8. »They are higher than the heavens. What can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave. What can you know?

9. »Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.

10. »Who can oppose the one who passes by and confines you in prison and convenes a court?

11. »He recognizes deceitful men. When he sees evil, does he not take note?

12. »An empty headed man can no more become wise than a wild donkeys colt can be born a man.

13. »Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,

14. if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,

15. then you will lift up your face without shame. You will stand firm without fear.

16. »You will forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.

17. »Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.

18. »You will be secure because there is hope. You will look about you and take your rest in safety.

19. »You will lie down and no one will make you afraid. Many will entreat your favor.

20. »But the eyes of the wicked will fail and they will not escape. Their hope will become a dying gasp.«

## Job 12

1. JOB RESPONDED:

2. »Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!

3. »I have a mind as well as you! I am not inferior to you! Who does not know all these things?

4. »I have become a laughingstock to my friends! I called upon God and he answered. Yet I am a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!

5. »Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.

6. »The tents of marauders prosper and those who provoke God are secure in what Gods hand brings them.

7. »Ask the animals and they will teach you, or the birds of the air and they will tell you.

10. »In his hand are the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.

11. »Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?

12. »Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?

15. »If he holds back the waters, there is drought. If he lets them loose, they devastate the land.

16. »To him belong strength and victory. Both deceived and deceivers are his.

17. »He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.

18. »He takes off the bonds put on by kings and ties a belt around their waist.

19. »He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.

20. »He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.

21. »He pours out contempt upon nobles and disarms the mighty.

22. »He uncovers the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.

23. »He makes nations great, and destroys them. He enlarges nations, and disperses them.

24. »He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason and understanding. He sends them wandering through a pathless wilderness.

25. »They grope in darkness without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.

## Job 13

__JOB CONTINUED__

1. »My eyes have seen all this and my ears have heard and understood it.

2. »I know what you know. I am not inferior to you!

3. »But I want to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.

4. »You are smearing me with lies. As doctors you are worthless, all of you!

5. »If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.

6. »Hear my argument. Listen to the plea of my lips.

7. »Will you speak wickedly on Gods behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?

8. »Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?

9. »Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?

10. »He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.

11. »Would not his excellence terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?

12. »Your platitudes are proverbs of ashes. Your defenses are defenses of clay.

13. »Keep silent and let me speak! Then let come to me what may.

14. »Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?

15. »Though he put me to death, yet I will hope in him. I will defend my ways before him.

16. »Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless man would dare come before him!

17. »Listen carefully to my words. Let your ears take in Pay attention to what I say.

18. »Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.

19. »Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.

20. »Only grant me these two things, O God, and then I will not hide from you:

21. Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.

22. »Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply.

23. How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my transgressions and my sin.

9. yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth growth like a plant.

10. »On the other hand man dies and is laid low. He breathes his last and is no more!

11. »Just like water that disappears from the sea or a riverbed that becomes parched and dry,

12. so men lie down and do not rise. Until the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.

## Job 29

2. »Oh, that I were as in months past, as in the days when God watched over me;

3. when his lamp shone over my head, and by his light I walked through darkness.

4. »I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent.

5. The Almighty was still with me, and my children were all around me.

6. »My steps were washed with milk and the rock poured out streams of oil for me!

7. »When I went out to the gate of the city, when I took my seat in the square,

8. the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose up and stood.

9. »The nobles refrained from talking, and laid their hands on their mouths.

10. »The voices of princes were hushed. Their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.

11. »When the ear heard, it commended me, and when the eye saw, it approved.

__JOB CONTINUED SPEAKING__

1. »Men younger than I am make fun of me now! Their fathers have always been so worthless that I would not let them help dogs guard sheep.

2. »They were a bunch of worn-out men, too weak to do any work for me.

3. »Shriveled up from need and hunger, they gnaw at the dry and barren ground during the night.

4. »They pick mallow salt herb from the underbrush, and the roots of the broom plant are their food.

7. »They howl in bushes and huddle together under thorn bushes.

8. »Godless fools and worthless people are forced out of the land with whips.

11. »Because God has untied my cord and has made me suffer, they are no longer restrained in my presence.

12. »They have attacked me on my right side like a mob. They trip my feet and then prepare ways to destroy me.

13. »They break up my path, they promote my calamity and no one restrains them!

14. »As through a wide breach they come. Amid the crash they roll on.

15. »Terrorists turn on me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.

16. »Now I am poured out, the days of affliction have taken hold of me.

17. »The night racks my bones, and the pain that eats at me takes no rest.

21. »You have turned cruel to me. With the might of your hand you appose me.

22. »You lift me up on the wind, you make me ride on it, and you toss me about in the roar of the storm.

## Job 31

__JOB CONTINUES__

1. »I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a young woman.

2. »What is mans lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high?

3. »Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?

4. »Does he not see my ways and count my every step?

5. »If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit

6. »let God weigh me on honest scales and he will know that I am blameless.

7. »If my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,

8. then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.

9. »If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbors door,

10. then may my wife grind another mans grain, and may other men sleep with her.

11. »For that would have been shameful a crime, a sin to be judged.

12. »That would be a fire consuming down to destruction, and it would burn all my harvest to the root.

13. »If I have rejected the cause of my male or female slaves, when they brought a complaint against me

14. what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?

15. »Did the one who made me in the womb make them? And did that one fashion us in the womb?

16. »If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

17. »If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the orphan has not eaten from it,

18. for from my youth I reared the orphan like a father, and from my mothers womb I guided the widow.

19. »If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or a poor person without covering,

20. whose loins have not blessed me, and who was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

21. if I have raised my hand against the orphan, because I saw I had supporters at the gate;

22. then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket.

23. »I was in terror of destruction from God and I could not face his majesty.

24. »If I have made gold my trust, or called fine gold my confidence,

25. if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, or because my hand had gotten much;

26. if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor,

27. and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand,

28. this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have denied God above.

29. »If I have rejoiced at the ruin of those who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook them,

30. »I have not let my mouth sin by asking for their lives with a curse.

31. »If those of my tent ever said: Who is not satisfied with his food?«

32. »The stranger has not lodged in the street for I have opened my doors to the traveler.

33. »If I have concealed my transgressions as others do like Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,

34. because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silent and did not go out of doors.

35. »Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me! Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!

36. »Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me like a crown.

37. »I would give him an account of all my steps. Like a prince I would approach him.

38. »If my land has cried out against me, and its furrows have wept together.

39. If I have eaten its yield without payment, and caused the death of its owners;

40. let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley.« The words of Job are ended, JOB QUITE TALKING.

## Job 32

__ELIHU SPEAKS__

1. So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.

2. Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry with Job because he justified himself rather than God.

3. He was angry also with Jobs three friends because they found no answer, though they had declared Job to be in the wrong.

4. Elihu waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.

5. When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.

6. Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered: »I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.

7. »I said: Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.

8. »But truly it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty that makes for understanding.

9. »It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what is right.

10. »Therefore I tell you: Listen to me! Let me also declare my opinion.

11. »Listen! I waited for your words. I listened for your wise sayings, while you determined what to say.

12. »I gave you my attention, but there was in fact no one that disproved Job, no one among you that answered his words.

13. »Yet do not say: We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a human.

14. »He has not directed his words against me. I will not answer him with your speeches.

15. »They are dismayed and they answer no more. They do not have a word to say.

16. »Should I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?

17. »I also will give my answer. I also will declare my opinion.

18. »For I am full of words but the spirit within me constrains me.

19. »My heart is indeed like wine that has no vent. It is like new wineskins and is ready to burst.

20. »I must speak so that I may find relief. I must open my lips and answer.

21. »I will not show partiality to any person or use flattery toward anyone.

22. »I do not know how to flatter or my Maker would soon put an end to me!

## Job 33

__ELIHU CONTINUED__

1. »Listen to my words Job. Pay attention to everything I say.

2. »I am about to open my mouth. My words are on the tip of my tongue.

3. »My words come from an upright heart! My lips sincerely speak what I know.

4. »The Spirit of God has made me. The Breath of the Almighty gives me life.

5. »Answer me then, if you can, and prepare yourself to confront me.

6. »I am just like you before God. I too have been taken from clay!

7. »No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.

8. »You have said in my hearing, I heard the very words:

9. »I am pure and without sin! I am clean and free from guilt.

10. »Yet God has found fault with me. He considers me his enemy!

11. »He fastens my feet in shackles and he keeps close watch on all my paths.

12. »But I tell you, Job, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.

13. »Why do you complain to him that he answers none of mans words?

14. »God does speak, now one-way and then another, though man may not perceive it.

15. »In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,

16. he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,

17. that turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride.

18. »It is to preserve him from the pit and keep his life from perishing by the sword.

19. »On the other hand a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones.

20. »His very being finds food repulsive and he loathes the choicest meal.

21. »His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.

22. »He draws near to the pit and to the messengers of death.

23. »Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,

24. to be gracious to him and say: Spare him from going down to the pit. I have found a ransom for him!

25. »His flesh is renewed like a childs. It is restored as in the days of his youth.

26. »He prays to God and finds favor with him. He sees Gods face and shouts for joy! God restores him to his righteous state.

27. »He comes to men and says: I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.

28. »He redeemed me from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.

29. »God does all these things to a man twice, even three times.

30. »He turns him back from the pit that the light of life may shine on him.

31. »Pay attention, Job, and listen to me! Be silent, and I will speak.

32. »If you have anything to say answer me. Speak up, for I want you to be cleared.

33. »But if not, then listen to me. Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.

## Job 34

1. ELIHU SPOKE MORE:

2. »Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know.

3. »For the ear tests words like the palate tastes food.

4. »Let us choose what is right. Let us determine among ourselves what is good.

5. »Job has said: I am innocent, and God has taken away my right.

6. »In spite of being right I am counted a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.

7. »Who is there like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water?

8. »Who goes in company with evildoers and walks with the wicked?

9. »He has said: It profits one nothing to take delight in God.

10. »Hear me, you who have sense, far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.

11. »According to their deeds he will repay them. According to their ways he will make it befall them.

12. »Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.

13. »Who gave God authority over the earth? Who has laid on him the entire world?

14. »If He should determine to do so, If He should gather to himself his spirit and his breath,

15. »All flesh would perish and man would return to dust.

16. »But if you understand, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words.

17. »Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn the righteous Mighty One?

18. »Should anyone even say to a king: You good-for-nothing scoundrel! Or to nobles, you wicked people!

19. »The one who is righteous and mighty does not grant special favors to princes or prefer important people to poor people because his hands made them all.

20. »They die suddenly in the middle of the night. People have seizures and pass away. Mighty people are taken away but not by human hands.

21. »God's eyes are on a person's ways. He sees all his steps.

22. There is no darkness or deep shadow where troublemakers can hide.

23. »He does not have to set a time for a person in order to bring him to divine judgment.

24. »He breaks mighty people into pieces without examining them and puts others in their places.

25. »He knows what they do, so he overthrows them at night, and they are crushed.

26. »In return for their evil, he strikes them in public.

27. »This is because they turned away from following him. They did not consider any of his ways.

28. »They forced the poor to cry out to him, and he hears the cry of those who suffer.

29. »If God decided to do nothing at all, no one could criticize him. If he hid his face refused to assist, we would be helpless.

30. »There would be nothing that nations could do to keep godless oppressors from ruling them.

31. »Job, have you confessed your sins to God and promised not to sin again?

32. »Have you asked God to show you your faults, and have you agreed to stop doing evil?

33. »Since you object to what God does, can you expect him to do what you want? The decision is yours, not mine. Tell us now what you think.

34. »Any sensible person will agree; and the wise that hear me will say

35. that Job is speaking from ignorance and that nothing he says make sense.

36. »Think through everything that Job says. You will see that he talks like an evil man.

37. »To his sins he adds rebellion and in front of us all he mocks God.

## Job 35

1. ELIHU CONTINUED:

2. »Do you think this to be just? You say: I am in the right before God.

3. »If you ask: What advantage do I have? How am I better off than if I had sinned?

4. »I will answer you and your friends with you.

5. Look at the heavens, observe the clouds and see. They are higher than you.

6. »If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?

7. »If you are righteous, what do you give to him? What does he receive from your hand?

8. »Your wickedness affects others like you, and your righteousness, other human beings.

9. »Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out. They call for help because of the arm of the mighty.

10. »However no one says: Where is God my Maker, who gives strength in the night?

11. »Who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?

12. »They cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evildoers.

13. »Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it.

14. »How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!

15. »Because his anger does not punish, and he does not greatly heed transgression,

16. »Job opens his mouth in empty talk. He multiplies words without knowledge.«

## Job 36

1. ELIHU TALKS EVEN MORE:

2. »Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in Gods behalf.

3. »I get my knowledge from afar. I ascribe justice to my Maker.

4. »Be assured that my words are not false! One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

5. »God is mighty, but does not despise men. He is mighty in strength of understanding.

6. »He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.

7. »He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous. He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.

8. »But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,

9. he tells them what they have done, that they have sinned arrogantly.

10. »He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.

11. »If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.

12. »However if they do not obey, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.

13. »The godless in heart harbor resentment. Even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.

14. »They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.

15. »But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.

16. »He would bring you out of the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.

17. »Now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked. Judgment and justice have taken hold of you.

18. »Be careful that no one entices you by riches. Do not let a large bribe turn you aside.

19. »Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?

20. »Do not desire the night, to drag people away from their homes.

21. »Do not turn to evil. You seem to prefer evil to affliction.

22. »God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?

23. »Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him: You have done wrong?

24. »Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.

25. »All mankind has seen it. Men gaze on it from afar.

26. »How great is God! He is beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.

27. »He draws up drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams.

28. »The clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.

29. »Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?

30. « See how he scatters his lightning, bathing the depths of the sea.

31. »This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.

32. »He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.

33. »His thunder announces the coming storm. Even the cattle make known its approach.

## Job 37

__ELIHU CONTINUES__

1. »The storm makes my heart beat wildly.

2. »Listen! All of you listen to the voice of God, to the thunder that comes from his mouth.

3. »He sends the lightning across the sky to the ends of the earth.

4. »He thunders with the roar of his voice! It is like the majestic sound of thunder, and all the while the lightning flashes.

5. »At God's command amazing things happen, wonderful things that we cannot understand.

6. »He says to the snow: Fall on the earth. He says to the rain: Be strong.

7. »He seals the hand of every man and all men may know His work.

8. »Then the beast goes into its lair. It remains in its den.

9. »Out of the south come the storm, and out of the north the cold.

10. »Ice is made from the breath of God. It freezes the expanse of the waters.

11. »He loads the thick cloud with moisture and disperses with lighting.

12. »They swirl about on the face of the inhabited earth. They do whatever God commands.

13. »He causes it to happen for correction, for his land and for his loving kindness.

14. « Listen to this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.

15. »Do you know how God establishes them? Do you know how he makes the lightning?

16. »Do you know about the layers of thick clouds, the wonders of one perfect in knowledge?

17. »You whose garments are hot, when the land is still because of the south wind?

18. »Have you, like him, spread out the skies, strong as a cast metal mirror?

19. »Teach us what we should say to him! We can arrange nothing because of darkness.

20. »Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up?

21. »Now men do not see the light that is bright in the skies when the wind passed and cleared them.

22. »Golden splendors come out of the north around Gods awesome majesty.

23. »We cannot find the Almighty. He is exalted in power but will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness.

24. »Therefore men respect him! He shows no partiality to the wise at heart.«

## Job 38

1. JEHOVAH ANSWERED JOB OUT OF THE WINDSTORM:

2. »Who is this that conceals hides counsel using words without knowledge?

3. »Prepare yourself like a man! I will question you, and you shall answer me.

4. »Where were you when I laid the earths foundation? Tell me, if you understand.

5. »Who determined its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?

6. »On what were its foundations set and who laid its cornerstone?

7. while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

8. »Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb?

9. »When I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,

10. when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,

11. when I said: This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt?

12. »Have you ever commanded the morning, or shown the dawn its place?

13. »It might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?

14. »The earth takes shape like clay under a seal. Its features stand out like those of a garment.

15. »The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.

16. »Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?

17. »Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?

18. »Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.

19. »Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And where does darkness reside?

20. »Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?

21. »Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!

22. »Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail?

23. »These I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle.

24. »What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?

25. »Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm?

26. »Who waters a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it?

27. Who satisfies a desolate wasteland to make it sprout with grass?

28. »Does the rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew?

29. »From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens

30. when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?

31. »Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?

32. »Can you bring forth the constellations of the zodiac in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs? Mazzaroth Constellation

33. »Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth?

2. »I know that you can do all things and no plan of yours can be thwarted.

3. »You asked: Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge? Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.

__JEHOVAH THEN SPOKE TO ELIPHAZ__

7. »I am angry with you and your two friends, because you did not speak correctly about me, as my servant Job has.

8. »So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You did not speak correctly about me, as my servant Job has.«

9. So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what Jehovah told them. And Jehovah accepted Jobs prayer.

10. After Job had prayed for his friends, Jehovah made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.

11. All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble Jehovah allowed to come upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.

12. Jehovah blessed the latter part of Jobs life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.

13. He also had seven sons and three daughters.

14. The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.

15. Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Jobs daughters. Their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.

17. He died a very old man.
