## Zechariah 1

__(Writer: Zechariah, means Jehovah Has Remembered) (518 B.C.E.) (Jerusalem)__

1. The word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet. It was in the eighth month, in the second year of Darius the king:

2. Jehovah was very angry with your fathers.

3. Tell them, Jehovah of Hosts has said: »Jehovah of Hosts says return to me and I will return to you.«

4. »Do not be like your fathers! The former prophets declared: Jehovah of Hosts said, I implore you, return from your evil ways, and from your wicked activities! But they did not listen, they paid no attention to me,« said Jehovah.

5. »Your fathers, where are they? The prophets, do they live forever?

6. »I commanded my servants the prophets to obey my words and my statutes. They disregarded them and suffered greatly. Then they repented and admitted that I, Jehovah of Hosts, corrected them as they deserved according to their deeds.«

7. In the second year that Darius was king, on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month the month of Shebat, Jehovah gave me a message in a vision at night.

8. He said: »I had a vision in the night. I saw someone riding a red horse. He stopped among some myrtle trees in a valley, and behind him were other horses, red, speckled, and white.«

9. I asked him, »Sir, what do these horses mean?« He answered: »I will show you what they mean.«

10. The man answered: »These are they whom Jehovah sent to inspect the earth.«

11. They spoke to the Messenger Angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle-trees: »We have patrolled the earth and the entire world is at rest.«

12. Then the Messenger Angel of Jehovah said: »Jehovah of Hosts, how much longer until you show compassion to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah? You have been angry with them for seventy years.«

13. Jehovah replied to the angel that talked with me with gracious and comforting words.

14. The angel said: »Call out, say, this is what Jehovah of Hosts has said: I am zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with intense ardor.

15. And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease secure. I was but a little angered and they caused my anger to grow into fury.«

16. »Therefore,« said Jehovah: »I will return to Jerusalem with compassion. My house will be built in it,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.«

17. »Pronounce again, Jehovah of hosts: My cities will again overflow with prosperity. Jehovah will comfort Zion and yet choose Jerusalem.«

18. I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.

19. I questioned the angel: »What are these?« And he answered me, »These are the horns governments that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.«

20. Then Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.

21. I asked: »What did these come to do?« He answered: »These are the horns that scattered Judah! No man lifted up his head for these came to terrify them. They will cast down the horns powerauthority of the nations that lifted up their horn powerauthority against the land of Judah to scatter it.«

## Zechariah 2

1. I lifted up my eyes and saw, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.

2. Then I asked: »Where are you going?« He said to me: »To measure Jerusalem, to see the width and the length of it.«

3. Behold! The angel went forth and another angel met him.

4. He said to him: »Run and speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle there.«

5. Jehovah said: »I will become to her a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.«

6. »Flee from the land of the north,« said Jehovah. »I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens,« continued Jehovah.

7. »Escape Zion! You who dwell with the daughter of Babylon should escape.

8. »Jehovah of Hosts proclaims: He sent me after glory! He sent me to the nations that plundered you. For he that touches you touches the pupil of his eye.

9. »Behold! I will shake my hand power over them, and they will be a spoil to those who served them.« Then you will know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me.

10. »Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! For I am coming, and I will dwell in the midst of you,« said Jehovah.

11. »Many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and will be my people! I will dwell in the your midst, and you will know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you.«

12. Jehovah will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will yet choose Jerusalem.

13. Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah, for he is aroused out of his holy dwelling.

## Zechariah 3

1. He showed me Joshua the high priest. Joshua was standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan was standing at his right hand to be his adversary.

2. Jehovah said to Satan: »Jehovah rebukes you, O Satan; yes, Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. Is this a brand plucked out of the fire?«

3. Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.

4. He spoke to those who stood before him: »Take the filthy garments from him. Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you and I will clothe you with rich apparel.«

5. I said: »Let them set a clean headdress upon his head.« So they set a clean headdress upon his head, and clothed him with garments. The angel of Jehovah was standing nearby.

6. And the angel of Jehovah witnessed to Joshua, saying:

7. »Jehovah of Hosts said: If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my ordinance you will judge my house and take care of my courts. I will give you free access among these that stand by.

8. »Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you. They are men that are a sign. I will bring forth my servant the Branch Sprout!

9. »Look at the stone I set before you Joshua. There are seven eyes on one stone. I will engrave the inscription on it,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.«

10. »In that day,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »you will invite every man and his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.«

## Zechariah 4

1. The angel who spoke with me returned and woke me from sleep.

2. He asked: »What do you see?« I answered: »I see a gold lamp stand, with a bowl on top and seven lamps. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top.

3. »There are two olive trees beside it. One is on the right side of the bowl and the other is on the left side of the bowl.«

4. I asked the angel who spoke to me: »What are these, my lord?«

5. The angel responded: »Do you not know what these are?« I said, »No, my lord.«

6. He answered: »This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel.« Then Jehovah of Hosts said: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit.«

7. »Who are you, O Great Mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. He will bring the head stone with shouts of blessing.«

8. The word of Jehovah continued to come to me:

9. »The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also finish it! You should know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you.

10. »For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven will rejoice, and will see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.«

11. I said to him: »What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side of it?«

12. I spoke a second time: »What are these two olive branches, that are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden oil from themselves?«

13. He answered: »You do not know what these are?« I said, »No, my lord.«

14. Then he said: »These are the two anointed ones who stand by Jehovah the God of the whole earth!«

## Zechariah 5

1. I opened my eyes again and I saw a flying scroll.

2. He asked me: »What do you see?« I said: »I see a flying scroll. It is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.«

3. He continued: »This is the curse that is upon the land. Every one who steals will be acquitted. Every one who swears falsely will be innocent.«

4. »I will cause it to happen,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of he who swears falsely by my name. The curse will abide in the midst of his house and will consume it with the timber and the stones of the house.«

5. Then the angel said: »Lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.«

6. I asked: »What is it?« And he replied: »This is the ephah measure that goes forth. This is their appearance in all the land«

7. A round flat weight made of lead was lifted up. There was a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah measure.

8. He said: »This is Wickedness.« He tossed her down into the middle of the ephah measure. He threw the weight of lead on the opening.

9. Two women came out with the wind in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork. They lifted up the ephah measure between earth and heaven.

10. I asked the angel: »Where are they taking the ephah measure?«

11. He answered: »To build her a house temple in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will be moved there to her own place.«

## Zechariah 6

1. I opened my eyes again and saw four chariots. They came out from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of copper.

2. In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;

3. and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.

4. Then I asked the angel: »What are these, my lord?«

5. The angel answered: »These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.

6. »The chariot with the black horses goes toward the North Country. The white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the South Country.

7. »The strong ones went forth, and sought to go that they might inspect the earth.« He said: »Go inspect the earth. Search back and forth through out the earth.« So they inspected the earth. They searched back and forth through out the earth.

8. Then he cried out to me: »Behold! Those who go toward the North Country have quieted my spirit of anger in the North Country.«

9. The word of Jehovah continued to come to me:

10. »Take them into captivity, even Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah. The same day go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. They came from Babylon.

11. »Take silver and gold and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

12. »Say to him: Jehovah of Hosts says, »See here, the man whose name is the Branch SproutShootBud. For he will branch out sprout from where he is and he will build the Temple of Jehovah.

13. »Yes, he will build the Temple of Jehovah. He will receive the glory, and will sit and rule upon his throne. He will be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.

14. »And the crowns will be given to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah. This will be for a memorial in the Temple of Jehovah.

15. »Those who are far off will come and build in the Temple of Jehovah.« You will know that Jehovah of Hosts sent me to you. This will come to pass if you will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.«

## Zechariah 7

1. The word of Jehovah came to Zechariah in the fourth year of King Darius. It was the fourth day of the ninth month that is Chislev.

2. Now they of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to request the favor of Jehovah.

3. Therefore speak to the priests of the house of Jehovah of Hosts, and say to the prophets: »Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these many years?«

4. Then came the word of Jehovah of Hosts to me:

5. »Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying: For the past seventy years did you fast for me when you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months?

6. »Did you eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?

7. »Should you hear the words that Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities near her and the South and the lowland were inhabited?«

8. And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah:

9. »Jehovah of Hosts has spoken: Every man should execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion to his brother!

10. »Do not oppress the widow. Do not oppress the fatherless. Do not oppress the stranger and do not oppress the poor. And you should not devise evil in your heart against your brother.

11. »They refused to pay heed, turned a stubborn shoulder resisted, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.

12. »They made their hearts hard like flint and would not listen to the law, and the words that Jehovah of Hosts sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Great anger came from Jehovah of Hosts!«

13. »I cried, and they would not listen. Now they will cry, and I will not listen, said Jehovah of Hosts!

14. I will scatter them with a whirlwind among the nations that they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned. They tread down the pleasant land and made it desolate.«

10. »Before those days, there was no wage for man or beast. The enemy set everyone against his neighbor and going or coming there was no peace.«

11. »I will not treat the remnant of this people the same as it was in the former days,« said Jehovah of Hosts.

12. »There will be peace for the seed. The vine will give its fruit. The ground will yield its increase. The heavens will offer their dew and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things!

13. »You were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel. I will save you! You will be blessed. Do not fear! Be strong!«

14. Jehovah of hosts said: »I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to anger. I have not relented,« Said Jehovah of Hosts.

21. »The inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of Hosts; I will go also.

22. »Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to request the favor of Jehovah.«

4. Jehovah my God said: »Feed the flock doomed to slaughter.

5. »Their owners slay them and claim they are not guilty. They that sell them say: Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich and their own shepherds do not pity them.

6. »I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,« said Jehovah. »I will deliver every one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king. They will strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.

7. »So I fed the poor of the flock of slaughter. I took two staffs; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

8. »And I eliminated the three shepherds in one month. I was tired of them, and they also abhorred me found me repugnant.

9. »Then I said, I will not feed you! If you die go ahead and die. Let those that are left eat each other!«

10. So I took my staff, Beauty, and broke it in pieces that I might break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples.

11. It was broken in that day. In this way, the poor of the flock listened to me and knew that it was the word of Jehovah.

12. I said to them, »If it is good in your sight give me my wages, if not forget it.« So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.

13. Jehovah said to me, »Throw it to the potter,« the amount they paid me. I took the thirty pieces of silver, and threw them to the potter, in the house of Jehovah.

14. I broke my other staff in pieces. It was the one I called Bands. That way I broke the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

15. Jehovah said: »Take yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.

16. »Warning! I will allow a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are perishing, and will not seek those that are scattered. This shepherd will not heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is hungry. He will eat the flesh of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.

10. »I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of kindness and of supplication.

11. »People will live there and there will be no more curses. Jerusalem will dwell safely.

20. »In that day it will be on the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH. And the pots in Jehovah's house will be like the bowls before the altar.

21. »Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Jehovah of Hosts! Every thing they sacrifice will be boiled in them. In that day there will be no more Canaanites in the House of Jehovah of Hosts.«
