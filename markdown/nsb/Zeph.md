## Zephaniah 1

__Writer: Zephaniah, means Jehovah has Concealed) (Before 648 B.C.E.) (Judah)__

1. This is the word Jehovah spoke to Zephaniah. Zephaniah was the son of Cushi, the grandson of Gedaliah, and the great-grandson of Amariah, son of Hezekiah. Jehovah spoke his word in the days of Judah's King Josiah, son of Amon.

2. »I will destroy take awayremoveconsume everything on the face of the earth!« declared Jehovah. (Zephaniah 2:3)

3. »I will terminate both man and beast. I will put an end to the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea. I will eliminate the sins that make people fall, together with the sinners. I will remove people from the face of the earth,« declared Jehovah.

4. »I will use my power against Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will destroy followers of Baal in this place. I will remove the names of the pagan idolatrous priests along with my priests.

5. »I will remove those who bow down to worship the host of heaven on the housetops and those who bow down and swear to Jehovah and yet swear by Malcolm.

6. »The same for those who have turned back from following Jehovah, and those who have not sought Jehovah or inquired of Him.«

7. Be silent before the Sovereign Lord Jehovah! For the day of Jehovah is near! Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice. He has sanctified His guests.

8. »On that day of Jehovahs sacrifice,« said Jehovah, »I will punish the officials, the king's sons, and all who practice foreign customs.

9. »I will punish all who worship false gods and who steal and kill in order to fill their master's house with violence.«

10. »On that day,« said Jehovah, »you will hear the sound of crying at the Fish Gate in Jerusalem. You will hear wailing in the newer part of the city and a loud crash from the hills.

11. »Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh! The people of Canaan have perished. Those wealthy with silver will be destroyed.

12. »At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps. I will punish the men that are satisfied with their wayward lifestyle. They say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good and he will not do evil.

13. »Their wealth will be looted. Their homes will be demolished. They will build houses. However they will not live in them! They will plant vineyards. But they will not drink their wine!

14. »The great Day of Jehovah is near. It is near and coming quickly. Listen! The mighty man will cry out bitterly on the Day of Jehovah.

15. »That day will be a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish. That day will be a day of trouble, devastation and desolation! It will be a day of darkness and gloom. Indeed that day will be a day of clouds and overcast skies.

16. »That day will be a day of alarm signals and battle cries against the fortified cities and against the high corner towers.

17. »I will bring distress on humans and they will walk like they are blind! They have sinned against Jehovah! Their blood will be poured out like dust and their intestines like manure.

18. »Their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the Day of Jehovahs anger ragewrath. He will devour all the nations by the fire of his zeal! He will exterminate all the inhabitants of the earth!«

## Zephaniah 2

1. Come together, make everyone come together, you nation without shame!

2. Before the decree takes effect. Before the day passes like the chaff. Before the fierce anger of Jehovah comes upon you. Yes, before the Day of Jehovah's anger comes upon you.

3. Seek Jehovah all you meek ones of the earth, you who have obeyed his Law! Seek righteousness! Seek meekness that you may be hidden in the Day of Jehovah's anger. Hebrew: ulay-ulay, may-be; Septuagint: »you may be hid.« Hebrew: sathar: concealed, hidden, protected (Zephaniah 1:2) (Amos 5:15)

4. For Gaza will be abandoned. Ashkelon will be a desolate waste. They will drive out Ashdod at high noon. Ekron will be exterminated.

5. »Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines. I will destroy you and you will not be inhabited.

6. »The seacoast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and pens for sheep.

7. »The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah. They will feed their flocks there. They will rest at night in the houses of Ashkelon. Jehovah their God will visit them and gather back the captive ones.«

8. »I have heard the reproach of Moab and the taunting by the children of Ammon. They have reproached my people. They behave arrogantly at the border.«

9. »Just as I live,« said Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, »Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah. They will be possessions of nettles and salt pits. They will be deserted forever! My people will plunder them and the remnant of my nation will take possession of their land.

10. »They will have this instead of their pride. This is because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of Hosts.

11. »Jehovah will fill them with fear for he will starve emaciate all the gods of the earth! Men will worship him, each one from his place, even the coastlands of the nations.

12. »You Ethiopians Cushites will be slain by my sword!

13. »He will stretch out his hand exercise his power against the north, and destroy Assyria. He will make Nineveh a desolation. It will be barren like the desert wilderness.

14. »And herds will lie down in her midst, all the beasts of the nations. The pelican and the porcupine will lodge on the top of her pillars. Their voice will sing hootcroak in the windows. Desolation will be in the thresholds for he will lay bare that which is built with cedar.

15. »This is the joyous city that dwelled in security. She said in her heart, I am! There is no one else! She has become an object of desolation, a place for wild animals to lie down in. Every one who passes by her will hiss, and wag his hand.«
