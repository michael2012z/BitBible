## 2 Chronicles 1

__(Writer: Ezra) (460 B.C.E.)__

__KING SOLOMON__

1. Solomon, son of David, strengthened his position over the kingdom. Jehovah, his God, was with him and made him very powerful.

2. Solomon spoke to all Israel. He spoke to the commanders of regiments and battalions, judges, every prince, and to the heads of Israels families.

3. Then Solomon and the entire assembly went to the place of worship in Gibeon because Gods Tent of Meeting was there. Jehovahs servant Moses pitched the tent in the desert.

4. David already brought Gods Ark from Kiriath Jearim to a place he had prepared for it. He pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.

5. The copper altar that Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur built was in front of Jehovahs Tent. There Solomon and the assembly worshiped Jehovah.

6. Solomon went to the copper altar in front of the Tent of Meeting and in Jehovahs presence sacrificed one thousand burnt offerings on it.

7. That night God appeared to Solomon. He said: »What do you want me to I give you?«

8. Solomon answered: »You always showed great love for my father David. Now you have allowed me to succeed him as king.

9. »O Jehovah my God, fulfill the promise you made to my father David. You have made me king over a people, who are so many that they cannot be counted.

10. »Please give me the wisdom and knowledge I need to rule over them. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?«

11. God replied to Solomon: »You have made the right choice. Instead of asking for wealth, treasure, fame or the death of your enemies or even for long life for yourself, you have asked for wisdom and knowledge so that you can rule my people, over whom I have made you king.

12. »For this reason I will give you wisdom and knowledge. And in addition, I will give you more wealth, treasure, and fame than any king has ever had before or will ever have again.«

13. So Solomon left the place of worship at Gibeon, where the Tent of Jehovahs presence was, and returned to Jerusalem. There he ruled over Israel.

14. Solomon assembled a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem. The rest he stationed in various other cities.

15. During his reign silver and gold became as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah.

16. Solomons merchants bought his string of horses and chariots in the regions of Musri and Kue.

17. They imported each chariot from Egypt for fifteen pounds of silver and each horse for six ounces of silver. For the same price they obtained horses to export to all the Hittite and Syrian kings.

## 2 Chronicles 2

1. Solomon gave orders to begin building the Temple for Jehovahs name and a royal palace for himself.

2. He drafted seventy thousand men to carry heavy loads, eighty thousand to quarry stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred foremen.

3. Solomon sent a message to King Hiram of Tyre: »Do business with me as you did with my father, King David, when you sold him cedar logs for building his palace.

4. »I am building a Temple to honor Jehovah my God. It will be a holy place where my people and I will worship him by burning incense of fragrant spices. We will present offerings of sacred bread to him continuously, and we will offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, as well as on Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and other holy days honoring Jehovah our God. He has commanded Israel to do this from generation to generation.

5. »I am determined to build a great Temple. This is because our God is greater than all other gods.

6. »No one can really build a Temple for God. This is because even all the vastness of heaven cannot contain him. How then can I build a Temple that would be anything more than a place to burn incense to God?

7. »Send me a man with skill in engraving, in working gold, silver, copper, and iron, and in making blue, purple, and red cloth. He will work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem whom my father David selected.

8. »I know how skillful your lumbermen are, so send me cedar, cypress, and juniper logs from Lebanon. I am ready to send my men to assist yours.

9. »Prepare large quantities of timber, because this Temple I intend to build will be large and magnificent.

10. »As provisions for your lumbermen, I will send you one hundred thousand bushels of wheat, one hundred thousand bushels of barley, one hundred and ten thousand gallons of wine, and one hundred and ten thousand gallons of olive oil.«

11. King Hiram sent Solomon a letter in reply. He wrote: »Jehovah made you their king because he loves his people.«

12. »Praise Jehovah the God of Israel, Creator of heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, full of understanding and skill. He now plans to build a Temple for Jehovah and a palace for himself.

13. »I am sending you a wise and skillful master metalworker named Huram Hiram-abi.

14. »He was the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan. His father is a native of Tyre. Huram knows how to work with gold, silver, copper, iron, stone, wood, purple, violet, and dark red cloth, and linen. He also knows how to make all kinds of engravings and follow any set of plans that will be given to him. He can work with your skilled workmen and the skilled workmen of His Majesty David, your father.

15. »Your Majesty may now send the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine he promised the workers.

16. »We will cut all the trees for lumber you need in Lebanon. Then we will make rafts out of it and send them to you in Joppa by sea. You can take it from there to Jerusalem.«

17. Solomon counted all the men who were foreigners in the land of Israel, as his father David had counted them. Solomon counted one hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred foreigners.

18. He directed seventy thousand of them carry heavy loads, eighty thousand of them quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred of them supervise the work as foremen.

## 2 Chronicles 3

__TEMPLE CONSTRUCTION BEGINS__

1. Solomon began to build Jehovahs Temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah. That is where Jehovah appeared to his father David. David had prepared the site on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

2. He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. It was in the place David had povided.

3. This is how Solomon laid the foundation to build Gods Temple. It was ninety feet long and thirty feet wide. They used the old standard measurement.

4. The entrance hall in front of the main room was thirty feet wide the same as the width of the temple and thirty feet high. He covered its inside walls with pure gold.

5. He paneled the larger building with cypress. Then he overlaid it with fine gold. It was decorated with designs in the form of palm trees and chains.

6. He covered the building with gems to beautify it and used gold from Parvaim.

7. He also overlaid the building, the rafters, the threshold, the walls, and the doors with gold. He carved cherubim angels on the walls.

8. He made the most holy place. It was as long as the Temple was wide, thirty feet long. It was also thirty feet wide. He overlaid it with forty-five thousand pounds of fine gold.

9. The gold nails weighed twenty ounces. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.

10. In the most holy place he made two sculptured cherubim angels and covered them with gold.

11. The combined length of the cherubim wings was thirty feet. A wing of one of the cherub was seven and one half feet long and touched the wall of the building. Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched one wing of the other cherub.

12. The wing of the other one of the cherub angels was seven and one half feet long and touched the other wall of the building. Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched the wing of the first cherub. So the cherubs combined wingspan was thirty feet.

13. They stood on their feet facing the main hall.

14. Solomon made the canopy of violet, purple, and dark red cloth and of linen and decorated it with cherubim.

15. He made two pillars for the front of the Temple. They were fifty-three feet long, and the crown on each pillar was seven and one half feet high.

16. He made chains for the inner room and also put them on the crowns. He made one hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.

17. He set up the pillars in front of the Temple, one on the right and the other on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin He Establishes and the one on the left Boaz In Him Is Strength.

## 2 Chronicles 4

1. King Solomon had a copper altar built. It was thirty feet square and fifteen feet high.

2. He also made a round tank molten sea of copper. It was seven and one half feet deep, fifteen feet in diameter, and forty-five feet in circumference.

3. All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of decorations, one above the other. The decorations were in the shape of bulls. They had been cast all in one piece with the rest of the tank.

4. The tank rested on the backs of twelve copper bulls that faced outward. Three faced in each direction, north, west, south and east.

5. The sides of the tank were three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a flower. The tank held about fifteen thousand gallons.

6. They also made ten basins, five to be placed on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. They were to be used to rinse the parts of the animals that were burned as sacrifices. The water in the large tank was for the priests to use for washing.

7. They made ten gold lamp stands according to the usual pattern, and ten tables, and placed them in the main room of the Temple.

8. He made ten tables and put them in the temple. Five were on the south side and five on the north side. And he made one hundred gold bowls.

9. He also made the priests courtyard and the large courtyard and its doors. He covered the doors with copper.

10. He set the pool on the south side in the southeast corner.

11. Huram also made the pots, shovels, and bowls. So Huram finished the work for King Solomon in Gods Temple:

12. Two pillars, bowl-shaped crowns on top of the two pillars, and two sets of filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on top of the pillars,

13. four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of filigree two rows of pomegranates for each filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on the pillars,

14. ten stands and ten basins on the stands,

15. one pool and the twelve bulls under it,

16. pots, shovels, and three-pronged forks. Huram Hiram-abiv made all of them out of polished copper for Jehovahs Temple at King Solomons request.

17. The king cast them in foundries in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah.

18. Solomon made so many of these products that no one tried to determine how much the copper weighed.

19. Solomon made all the furnishings for Gods Temple: the gold altar, the gold tables on which the bread of the presence was placed,

20. lamp stands and lamps of pure gold to burn as directed in front of the inner room,

21. flowers, lamps, pure gold tongs,

22. snuffers, basins, dishes, incense burners of pure gold, the gold entrance to the temple, the gold doors of the most holy place, and the gold doors of the Temple.

## 2 Chronicles 5

__TEMPLE COMPLETED__

1. The work Solomon did on Jehovahs Temple was finished. He brought the holy things that had belonged to his father David, the silver, gold, and all the utensils. He put them in the storerooms of Gods Temple.

2. Then Solomon assembled the respected leaders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the Israelite families. They came to Jerusalem to take the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah from the City of David, which is Zion.

3. The men of Israel gathered around the king at the Festival of Booths in the seventh month.

4. When all the leaders of Israel had arrived, the Levites picked up the ark.

5. They brought the Ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy utensils in it to the Temple. The priests and the Levites carried them

6. while King Solomon and the whole assembly from Israel were offering countless sheep and cattle sacrifices in front of the Ark.

7. The priests brought Jehovahs Ark of the Covenant to its place in the inner room of the Temple, the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim angels.

8. The cherubim angels outstretched wings were over the place where the Ark rested so that the cherubim became a covering above the Ark and its poles.

9. The poles were so long that their ends could be seen in the holy place by anyone standing in front of the inner room. However they could not be seen outside. They are still there today.

10. There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets Moses placed there at Horeb, where Jehovah made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt.

11. All the priests who were present had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy to God without regard to staying in their divisions.

12. All the Levites who were musicians: Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons, and their relatives were dressed in fine linen and stood east of the altar with cymbals, harps, and lyres. With the musicians were one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets. When the priests left the holy place,

13. the trumpeters and singers praised and thanked Jehovah in unison. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other musical instruments, they sang in praise to Jehovah: »He is good; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever.« Then Jehovahs Temple was filled with a cloud.

14. The priests could not serve because of the cloud. Jehovahs glory filled the Temple of God.

## 2 Chronicles 6

1. Then Solomon proclaimed: »Jehovah said he would live in a dark cloud.

2. »But I have built you a high Temple. It is a home for you to live in permanently.«

3. Then the king turned around and blessed the entire assembly from Israel while they were standing.

4. »Thanks be to Jehovah God of Israel. With his mouth he made a promise to my father David. With his hand he carried it out.« He said:

5. »Since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose any city from the tribes of Israel as a place to build a Temple for my name. And I did not choose any man to be prince over my people Israel.

6. »Now I have chosen Jerusalem to be a place for my name. I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.

7. »My father David had his heart set on building a Temple for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

8. »However, Jehovah said to my father David: Since you had your heart set on building a Temple for my name, your intentions were good.

9. »You must not build the Temple. Instead, your own son will build the Temple for my name.

10. »Jehovah has kept the promise he made. I have taken my father Davids place. I sit on the throne of Israel as Jehovah promised. I have built the Temple for the name of Jehovah God of Israel.

11. »I put the Ark that contains Jehovahs promise to Israel there.«

__SOLOMONS DEDICATION PRAYER__

12. In the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, Solomon stood in front of Jehovahs altar. He stretched out his hands to pray.

13. Solomon had made a copper platform seven and one half feet long, seven and one half feet wide, and four and one half feet high. He put it in the middle of the courtyard. He stood on the platform, knelt in front of the entire assembly, and stretched out his hands toward heaven.

14. He said: »Jehovah God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth. You keep your promise of mercy to your servants, who obey you wholeheartedly.

15. »You have kept your promise to my father David, your servant. With your mouth you promised it. With your hand you carried it out as it is today.

16. »Now then, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep your promise to my father David, your servant. You said: You will never fail to have an heir sitting in front of me on the throne of Israel if your descendants are faithful to me as you have been faithful to me.

17. »Therefore, Jehovah, God of Israel, may the promise you made to David, your servant, come true.

18. »Does God really live on earth with people? If heaven and the highest heaven cannot hold you, then how can this Temple that I have built?

19. »Nevertheless, O Jehovah my God, please pay attention to my prayer for mercy. Listen to my cry for help as I pray to you.

20. »Day and night may your eyes be on this Temple, the place where you said your name will be. Listen to me as I pray toward this place.

21. »Hear the plea for mercy that your people Israel and I pray toward this place. Hear us in heaven, the place where you live. Hear and forgive.

22. »If anyone sins against another person and is required to take an oath and comes to take the oath in front of your altar in this temple,

23. then hear that person in heaven, take action, and make a decision. Repay the guilty person with the proper punishment, but declare the innocent person innocent.

24. »An enemy may defeat your people Israel because they have sinned against you. But when your people return, praise your name, pray, and plead with you in this Temple,

25. then hear them in heaven, forgive the sins of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land that you gave to them and their ancestors.

26. »When the sky is shut and there is no rain because they are sinning against you and they pray toward this place, praise your name, and turn away from their sin because you made them suffer,

27. then hear them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the proper way to live. Then send rain on the land, which you gave to your people as an inheritance.

28. »There may be famine in the land. Plant diseases, heat waves, funguses, locusts, or grasshoppers may destroy crops. Enemies may blockade Israels city gates. During every plague or sickness

29. hear every prayer for mercy made by one person or by all the people in Israel, all who know suffering or pain, who stretch out their hands toward this Temple.

30. »Hear them in heaven, where you live. Forgive them and give people the proper reply. You know what is in their hearts, because you alone can read hearts.

31. as long as they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors, they will reverence you and follow you.

32. »People who are not Israelites will come from distant countries because of your great name, mighty hand, and powerful arm. When they come to pray facing this Temple,

33. then hear them in heaven, the place where you live. Do everything they ask so that all the people of the world may know your name and respect you like your people Israel and learn that this Temple that I built bears your name.

34. »When your people go to war against their enemies, you send them and they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the Temple I built for your name,

35. then hear their prayer for mercy in heaven, and do what is right for them.

36. »They may sin against you. There is no man who is without sin. You may become angry with them and hand them over to an enemy who takes them to another country as captives, whether it is far or near.

37. »If they come to their senses, are sorry for what theyve done, and plead with you in the land where they are captives, saying: We have sinned. We have done wrong. We have been wicked.

38. »If they change their attitude toward you in the land where they are captives. If they pray to you toward the land that you gave their ancestors, and the city you have chosen, and the Temple I have built for your name,

39. then in heaven, the place where you live, hear their prayer for mercy. Do what is right for them. Forgive your people, who have sinned against you.

40. »Finally, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.

41. »Now arise, and come to your resting place, Jehovah our God, you and the ark of your power. Clothe your priests, Jehovah God, with salvation. Let your godly ones rejoice in what is good.

42. »O Jehovah our God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember your mercy to your servant David!«

## 2 Chronicles 7

1. When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices, and Jehovahs glory filled the Temple.

2. The priests could not go into Jehovahs Temple because Jehovahs glory had filled it.

3. When all the Israelites saw the fire come down and Jehovahs glory on the Temple, they knelt down with their faces on the pavement. They worshiped and praised Jehovah. They said: »He is good; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever.«

4. Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to Jehovah.

5. King Solomon offered twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep as sacrifices to Jehovah. Thus the king and all the people dedicated Gods Temple.

6. The priests were standing at their posts. So were the Levites who had Jehovahs musical instruments that King David made for praising Jehovah. They were saying: »his mercy endures forever.« This he used to offer praise. The priests were opposite the Levites blowing trumpets while all Israel was standing there.

7. Solomon designated the courtyard in front of Jehovahs Temple as a holy place. He sacrificed the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat because the copper altar that he had made and that was in front of Jehovah was not able to hold all of them.

8. Then Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Booths. A very large crowd came from the territory between the border of Hamath and the River of Egypt.

9. There was an assembly on the eighth day. They observed the dedication of the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for another seven days.

10. Solomon dismissed the people to their tents on the twenty-third day of the seventh month. They rejoiced with cheerful hearts for all the blessings Jehovah had given David, Solomon, and his people Israel.

11. Solomon finished Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace and completed everything he had in mind for Jehovahs Temple and his own palace.

12. JEHOVAH APPEARED TO SOLOMON THAT NIGHT. He said to Solomon: »I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a Temple for sacrifices.

13. »I may shut the sky so that there is no rain, or command grasshoppers to devour the countryside, or send an epidemic among my people.

14. »However, if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, pray, search for me, and turn from their evil ways, I will hear their prayer from heaven, forgive their sins, and heal their country.

15. »My eyes will be open! My ears will pay attention to the prayers offered at this place.

16. »I have chosen and declared this Temple holy so that my name may be placed there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.

17. »If you will be faithful to me as your father David was, do everything I command, and obey my laws and rules,

18. »I will establish your royal dynasty just as I said in a promise to your father David, when I said: You will never fail to have an heir ruling over Israel.«

19. »On the other hand, if you and your descendants turn away from me and abandon my commandments and laws that I gave you, and follow and serve other gods and worship them,

20. »I will uproot Israel from the land I gave them. I will reject this Temple that I declared holy for my name. I will make it an example and an object of ridicule for all the people of the world.

21. »Everyone passing by this impressive Temple will be appalled. They will ask: Why did Jehovah do these things to this land and to this Temple?

22. »They will answer their own question: They abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt. They adopted other gods, worshiped, and served them. That is why he brought this disaster on them.«

## 2 Chronicles 8

1. It took Solomon twenty years to build Jehovahs house and his own house.

2. He rebuilt the cities Huram gave him. He had Israelites live in them.

3. Solomon attacked Hamath Zobah and conquered it.

4. He rebuilt Tadmor in the desert and built all the storage cities in Hamath.

5. He also rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon into cities fortified with walls, double-door gates, and bars.

6. He also rebuilt Baalath and all the storage cities that he owned. He built all the cities for his chariots, all the cities for his warhorses, and whatever else he wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or the entire territory that he governed.

7. The Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites had been left in the land because the Israelites had not been able to destroy them. They were not Israelites.

8. They had descendants who were still in the land. Solomon drafted them for slave labor. They are still Israels slaves today.

9. Solomon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for his projects. Instead, they were the soldiers, officers, generals, and commanders of his chariot and cavalry units.

10. These were the officers in charge of King Solomons projects: two hundred and fifty foremen for the people who did the work.

11. Then Solomon brought Pharaohs daughter up from the city of David to the house he had built for her. He said: »My wife must not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy where the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant has entered.«

12. Solomon offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah he had built before the porch.

13. He did so according to the daily rule, offering them up according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the new moons and the three annual feasts, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths.

14. As Solomons father David had directed, he set up the divisions of priests for their service and the divisions of Levites for their appointed places. The Levites were to lead in praising Jehovah and to serve beside the priests by doing whatever needed to be done each day. Solomon also set up divisions of doorkeepers at every gate because this was what David, the man of God, had commanded.

15. No one neglected the kings orders to the priests or the Levites in any matter, including the Temples finances.

16. All of Solomons work was carried out from the day the foundation of Jehovahs Temple was laid until it was completed. Jehovahs Temple was now complete.

17. Then Solomon went to the coast near Ezion Geber and Elath in Edom.

18. Huram sent his own servants and his experienced sailors with ships to Solomon. They went with Solomons servants to Ophir. There they procured thirty three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds of gold, and brought it to King Solomon.

## 2 Chronicles 9

1. The QUEEN OF SHEBA heard about Solomons reputation. So she came to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She arrived with a large group of servants. They had camels carrying spices, a large quantity of gold, and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.

2. Solomon answered all her questions. No question was too difficult for Solomon to answer.

3. When the queen of Sheba saw Solomons wisdom, the palace he built,

4. the food on his table, his officers seating arrangement, the organization of his officials and the uniforms they wore, his cupbearers and their uniforms, and the burnt offerings that he sacrificed at Jehovahs Temple, she was breathless.

5. She told the king: »What I heard in my country about your words and your wisdom is true!

6. »I did not believe the reports until I came and saw it with my own eyes. I was not even told about half of the extent of your wisdom. You have surpassed the stories I heard.

7. »Your men are indeed blessed! Your servants are truly blessed. It is because they are always stationed near you and listen to your wisdom!

8. »I thank Jehovah your God, who is pleased with you. He has put you on his throne to be king on behalf of Jehovah your God. Because of your Gods love for the people of Israel, he has established them permanently and made you king over them so that you would maintain justice and righteousness.«

9. The queen gave the king nine thousand pounds of gold, a very large quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never was there such a large quantity of spices in Israel as those that the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.

10. Hurams servants and Solomons servants who brought gold from Ophir also brought sandalwood and precious stones.

11. With the sandalwood the king made gateways to Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace. They also made lyres and harps for the singers. No one had ever seen anything like them in Judah.

12. King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba anything she wanted. Whatever she asked for, more than what she had brought him. Then she and her servants went back to her country.

13. The gold that came to Solomon in one year weighed forty nine thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds,

14. not counting the gold that the merchants and traders brought. All the Arab kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.

15. King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold, using fifteen pounds of gold on each shield.

16. He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, using seven and one half pounds of gold on each shield. The king put them in the hall named the Forest of Lebanon.

17. King Solomon also made a large ivory throne and covered it with pure gold.

18. Six steps led to the throne. It had a gold footstool attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat. Two lions stood beside the armrests.

19. Twelve lions stood on six steps, one on each side. Nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.

20. All King Solomons cups were gold. All the utensils for the hall named the Forest of Lebanon were fine gold. Silver was not considered valuable in Solomons time.

21. The king had ships going to Tarshish with Hurams sailors. Once every three years the Tarshish ships would bring gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.

__SOLOMON RICHEST KING ON EARTH__

22. King Solomon was greater in wealth and wisdom than all the other kings of the world.

23. All the kings of the world wanted to listen to the wisdom that God gave Solomon.

24. Everyone who came brought him gifts such as articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This happened year after year.

25. Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand war horses. He stationed some in chariot cities and others with himself in Jerusalem.

26. He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the country of the Philistines and as far as the Egyptian border.

27. The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones. He made cedars as plentiful as fig trees in the foothills.

28. Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all other countries.

29. The rest of the acts of Solomon from first to last are written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh, and in Iddo the seers visions about Jeroboam son of Nebat.

30. Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.

31. Solomon lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 10

1. Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.

2. Jeroboam, Nebats son, was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon. When he heard about Rehoboam, he returned from Egypt.

3. Israel sent for Jeroboam and invited him back. Jeroboam and all Israel went to speak to Rehoboam. They said:

4. »Your father made us carry a heavy burden. Reduce the hard work and lighten the heavy burden he put on us. We will serve you.«

5. He said to them: »Come back the day after tomorrow.« So the people left.

6. King Rehoboam sought advice from the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive. He asked: »What do you advise? How should I respond to these people?«

7. They told him: »If you are good to these people and try to please them by speaking gently to them, then they will always be your servants.«

8. He ignored the advice the elders gave him. He sought advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.

9. He asked: »What is your advice? How should we respond to these people who are asking me to lighten the burden my father put on them?«

10. The young men who had grown up with him answered: »This is what you should tell them: My little finger is heavier than my fathers whole body.

11. »If my father put a heavy burden on you, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will punish you with scorpions.«

12. So Jeroboam and all the people came back to Rehoboam two days later, as the king had instructed them.

13. The king answered them harshly. He ignored the elders advice.

14. He spoke to them as the young men advised. He said: »If my father made your burden heavy, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will use scorpions.«

15. The king refused to listen to the people because Jehovah was directing these events to carry out the promise he had made to Jeroboam, Nebats son through Ahijah from Shiloh.

16. When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king: »What share do we have in Davids kingdom? We will not receive an inheritance from Jesses son. Everyone to his own tent, Israel! Now look after your own house, David!« So all Israel went home to their tents.

17. Rehoboam ruled the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.

18. King Rehoboam sent Hadoram to the Israelites. He was in charge of forced labor, but they stoned him to death. So King Rehoboam got on his chariot as fast as he could and fled to Jerusalem.

19. Israel has rebelled against Davids dynasty to this day.

## 2 Chronicles 11

1. Rehoboam came to Jerusalem and gathered the people of Judah and Benjamin. There were one hundred and eighty thousand of the best soldiers, to fight against Israel and return the kingdom to Rehoboam.

2. God spoke his word to Shemaiah, the man of God. He said:

3. »Speak to Judahs King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, and all Israel in Judah and Benjamin.«

4. Jehovah says: »Do not wage war against your relatives. Everyone, go home. What has happened is my doing.« So they obeyed the word of Jehovah. They turned back from their attack on Jeroboam.

5. Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem. He built fortified cities in Judah.

6. He rebuilt Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,

7. Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,

8. Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,

9. Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,

10. Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.

11. He strengthened the cities and put army officers with reserves of food, olive oil, and wine in them.

12. He stored shields and spears in each city. He made the cities very secure. Rehoboam held on to Judah and Benjamin.

13. The priests and Levites in every region of Israel aligned with Rehoboam.

14. The priests abandoned their land and property and went to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his descendants rejected them as Jehovahs priests.

15. As an alternative, Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the illegal worship sites and the goat and calf statues he had made as idols.

16. People from every tribe of Israel who were determined to seek Jehovah the true God of Israel followed the Levitical priests to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah God of their ancestors.

17. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah by supporting Rehoboam, son of Solomon, for three years. During those three years they lived the way David and Solomon had lived.

18. Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth. Jerimoth was the son of David and Abihail. Abihail was the daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse.

19. Mahalath gave birth to the following sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.

20. After marrying Mahalath, he married Maacah, Absaloms granddaughter. She gave birth to Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.

21. Rehoboam loved Maacah, Absaloms granddaughter, more than all his other wives and concubines. He had eighteen wives and sixty concubines. He fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.

22. Rehoboam appointed Abijah, son of Maacah, as family head and prince among his brothers. By doing this, Rehoboam could make him king.

23. He wisely placed his sons in every region of Judah and Benjamin, in every fortified city. He gave them allowances and obtained many wives for them.

## 2 Chronicles 12

__REHOBOAM BECOMES STRONG__

1. Rehoboam established his kingdom and made himself strong. He and all Israel abandoned Jehovahs teachings.

2. King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. This took place in the fifth year of Rehoboams reign. It happened because all Israel was not loyal to Jehovah.

3. Shishak had twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horses, and an army of countless Libyans, Sukkites, and Sudanese from Egypt.

4. He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.

5. Shemaiah the prophet approached Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak. He said to them: »Jehovah says: You have forsaken me, so I also have forsaken you to Shishak.«

6. Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said: »Jehovah is righteous.«

7. Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves. The word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah. He said: »They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them. I will grant them deliverance. I will not use Shishak to pour out my anger on Jerusalem.

8. »However, they will become his servants. They must learn the difference between serving me and serving foreign kings.«

9. King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures from Jehovahs temple and the royal palace. He took them all! He even took the gold shields Solomon had made.

10. As a result King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them. He put them by the entrance to the royal palace, where the captains of the guards were stationed.

11. When the king went into Jehovahs Temple, guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom.

12. When Rehoboam humbled himself, the anger of Jehovah turned from him. He did not completely destroy him. So things went well in Judah.«

13. King Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and ruled. He was forty-one years old when he began to rule. He ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah chose from all the tribes of Israel, and the city where Jehovah put his name. Rehoboams mother was an Ammonite woman named Naamah.

14. He did evil because he did not seriously dedicate his life to Jehovah.

15. The events concerning Rehoboam from first to last are written in the records of the prophet Shemaiah and the records of the seer Iddo in the genealogies? There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam as long as they lived.

16. Rehoboam lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Abijah succeeded him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 13

__KING ABIJAH__

1. Abijah became king of Judah in Jeroboams eighteenth year as king of Israel.

2. His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. He ruled from Jerusalem for three years when war broke out between Abijah of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel.

3. Abijah raised an army of four hundred thousand soldiers. Jeroboam opposed him with an army of eight hundred thousand soldiers.

4. The armies met in the hill country of Ephraim. King Abijah went up Mount Zemaraim and called out to Jeroboam and the Israelites: »Listen to me!« He shouted.

5. »Do you not know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, made an unbreakable covenant with David, giving him and his descendants kingship over Israel from generation to generation?

6. »Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against Solomon, his king.

7. »Later he organized a group of worthless scoundrels. They forced their will on Rehoboam son of Solomon, who was too young and inexperienced to resist them.

8. »Now you plan to fight against the royal authority Jehovah gave to Davids descendants. You have a huge army! You have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.

9. »You drove out Jehovahs priests! You evicted the descendants of Aaron and the Levites. In their place you appointed priests in the same way that other nations do. Anybody who comes along with a bull or seven sheep can get himself consecrated as a priest of those so-called gods of yours.

10. »We still serve Jehovah our God! We have not abandoned him. Priests descended from Aaron perform their duties, and Levites assist them.

11. »Every morning and every evening they offer him incense and animal sacrifices burned whole. They present the offerings of bread on a table that is ritually clean, and every evening they light the lamps on the gold lamp stand. We do what Jehovah has commanded! But you have abandoned him!

12. »God is with us as our leader. His priests will sound their trumpets to call the army to fight you. Men of Israel do not wage war against Jehovah the God of your ancestors. You will not succeed.«

13. Jeroboam set an ambush to attack them from behind. So Jeroboams army was in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.

14. Judahs soldiers looked around and found the battle was in front of them and behind them. They cried out to Jehovah! The priests blew the trumpets,

15. The men of Judah shouted! When they shouted God attacked Jeroboam and all Israel in front of Abijah and Judah.

16. The Israelites fled from Judahs army. God handed them over to Judah.

17. Abijah and his men defeated them decisively. Five hundred thousand of the best men of Israel were killed.

18. The Israelites were humbled at that time. The people of Judah won because they trusted Jehovah God of their ancestors.

19. Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some of his cities: Bethel and its villages, Jeshanah and its villages, and Ephron and its villages.

20. Jeroboam never regained power during Abijahs time. Jehovah caused Jeroboam to become sick, and Jeroboam died.

21. Abijah became strong. He married fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.

22. The history of Abijah, including how he lived, is written by the prophet Iddo.

## 2 Chronicles 14

1. Abijah slept in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Asa succeeded him as king. In Asas time the land had peace for ten years.

2. Asa did what Jehovah his God considered good and right.

3. He got rid of the altars of foreign gods. He broke down the sacred stones. He cut down the poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah.

4. He told the people of Judah to dedicate their lives to Jehovah. They were to serve the God of their ancestors and observe obey his teachings and commandments.

5. He got rid of the illegal places of worship and destroyed the altars for incense in all the cities of Judah. The kingdom was at peace during his reign.

6. He built fortified cities in Judah and the land had peace. There was no war during those years because Jehovah gave him a time of peace.

7. Asa told Judah: »Let us build these cities and make walls around them with towers and doors that can be barred. The country is still ours because we have dedicated our lives to serve Jehovah our God. We have dedicated our lives to him. He has surrounded us with peace.« So they built the cities, and everything went well.

8. Asa had an army of three hundred thousand Judeans who were armed with large shields and spears and two hundred and eighty thousand Benjaminites who were armed with small shields and bows. All of these men were strong fighting men.

9. Zerah from Ethiopia led an army of a million soldiers and three hundred chariots to the town of Mareshah in Judah.

10. Asa met him there. The two armies prepared for battle in Zephathah Valley near Mareshah.

11. Asa prayed: »Jehovah, only you can help a powerless army defeat a stronger one. We depend on you to help us. We will fight against this powerful army to honor your name! We know that you will not be defeated. You are Jehovah our God. Do not let man prevail against you.«

12. Jehovah helped Asa and his army defeat the Ethiopians. The enemy soldiers ran away,

13. Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. It was a total defeat! The Ethiopians could not even fight back! The soldiers from Judah took everything that had belonged to the Ethiopians.

14. Asa and his army attacked all the cities around Gerar because the cities were in dread of Jehovah. The army looted all the cities because there were many things to take.

15. They also attacked those who were letting their cattle graze and captured many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 15

1. Gods Spirit came to Azariah, son of Oded.

2. Azariah went to Asa and said: »Listen to me Asa and all you men from Judah and Benjamin. Jehovah is with you when you are with him. If you will dedicate your lives to serve him, he will accept you. But if you abandon him, he will abandon you.

3. »Israel was without the true God for a long time. They were without a priest who taught correctly, and without law.

4. »When they were in trouble they turned to Jehovah the God of Israel. When they searched for him, he let them find him.

5. »No one could come and go in peace at that time. This is because everyone living in the land had a lot of turmoil.

6. »One nation crushed another nation. One city crushed another. God tormented them with every kind of trouble.

7. »But you must remain strong and not become discouraged. Your actions will be rewarded.«

8. Asa heard the prophet Odeds words of prophecy. He was encouraged and put away the detestable idols from all of Judah, Benjamin, and the cities he had captured in the mountains of Ephraim. He also repaired Jehovahs altar in front of Jehovahs entrance hall.

9. Then Asa gathered all the people from Judah and Benjamin and the foreigners who had come from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon. Many of them had come to him from Israel when they saw that Asas God, Jehovah, was with him.

10. In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asas reign, they gathered in Jerusalem.

11. They sacrificed to Jehovah a part of the loot they brought with them: seven hundred cattle and seven thousand sheep.

12. They made an agreement with one another to dedicate their lives to serve the true God Jehovah, the God of their ancestors with all their heart and all their being.

13. All people, young and old, male and female, who refused to dedicate their lives to the true God Jehovah the God of Israel were to be killed.

14. Asa and the people swore their oath to Jehovah with shouts, singing, and the blowing of trumpets and rams horns.

15. All the people of Judah were overjoyed because of the oath. They took the oath wholeheartedly. They took great pleasure in looking for Jehovah. And he let them find him. So Jehovah surrounded them with rest and peace.

16. King Asa also removed his grandmother Maacah from the position of queen mother. She made a statue of the repulsive goddess Asherah. Asa immediately cut the statue down, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.

17. Although the illegal worship sites in Israel were not taken down, Asa remained committed to Jehovah his entire life.

18. He brought into Gods Temple the silver, the gold, and the utensils he and his father had set apart as holy.

19. There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asas reign.

## 2 Chronicles 16

1. It was the thirty-sixth year of Asas reign. King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and built fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from going to or coming from King Asa of Judah.

2. Then Asa brought out all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace. He sent them to Damascus to King Benhadad.

3. He said: »There is a treaty between you and me as there was between your father and my father. I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone.«

4. Benhadad agreed to do what King Asa requested. He sent his generals and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities in the territory of Naphtali.

5. When King Baasha heard what happened he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned the work.

6. King Asa gathered men from throughout Judah and had them carry off the stones and timbers that Baasha had been using at Ramah. They used them to fortify the cities of Geba and Mizpah.

7. Then the prophet Hanani went to King Asa. He said: »Because you relied on the king of Syria instead of relying on Jehovah your God, the army of the king of Israel has escaped from you.

8. »The Ethiopians and the Libyans, did they have large armies with many chariots and cavalry troops? But because you relied on Jehovah he gave you victory over them.

9. »The eyes of Jehovah keep close watch over the entire world. He gives strength shows His strength to in behalf of those whose hearts are loyal to him. You have acted foolishly! Therefore from now on you will always be at war.«

10. Asa was so angry with the prophet that he had him put in chains. It was at this same time that Asa began treating some of the people cruelly.

11. All the events of Asas reign from beginning to end are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

12. In the thirty-ninth year that Asa was king a severe foot disease crippled him. Even then he did not turn to Jehovah for help, but to doctors.

13. Two years later he died.

14. Asa was buried in the rock tomb that he had carved out for himself in Davids City. They used spices and perfumed oils to prepare his body for burial. They built a huge bonfire to mourn his death.

## 2 Chronicles 17

__KING JEHOSHAPHAT__

1. Jehoshaphat succeeded his father Asa as king and strengthened his position against Israel.

2. He stationed troops in the fortified cities of Judah. He also put troops in the Judean countryside, and in the cities that Asa had captured in the territory of Ephraim.

3. Jehovah blessed Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his fathers early life and did not worship Baal.

4. He served his fathers God. He obeyed Gods commandments, and did not act the way the kings of Israel did.

5. Jehovah gave Jehoshaphat firm control over the kingdom of Judah. The people brought him gifts, so that he became wealthy and highly honored.

6. His heart was devoted to the ways of Jehovah. He destroyed all the pagan places of worship and the symbols of the goddess Asherah in Judah.

7. In the third year of his reign he sent out the following officials to teach in the cities of Judah: Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah.

8. With them were the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, Tob Adonijah, and the priests Elishama and Jehoram.

9. They taught in Judah. They had the Book of Torah the LawJehovahs Teachings with them when they taught the people in all the cities of Judah.

10. All the kingdoms around Judah were afraid of Jehovah. As a result, they did not wage war against Jehoshaphat.

11. Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as taxes. The Arabs also brought him flocks: seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats.

12. Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful. He built fortresses and cities where supplies were stored in Judah.

13. He stored large supplies of food in the cities of Judah and an army of professional soldiers served him in Jerusalem.

14. The following is a breakdown of these soldiers. They are listed by families. Judahs regimental commanders were Commander Adnah with three hundred thousand fighting men,

15. next to him was Commander Jehohanan with two hundred and eighty thousand men.

16. There was Amasiah, Zichris son, who volunteered to serve Jehovah with two hundred thousand fighting men.

17. From Benjamin there was the fighting man Eliada with two hundred thousand armed men with bows and shields.

18. Next to him was Jehozabad with an army of one hundred and eighty thousand armed men.

19. These were the men who served the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 18

1. Jehoshaphat was wealthy and honorable. He became Ahabs in-law.

2. After that he went to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for a banquet in honor of Jehoshaphat and the people who were with him. Ahab persuaded Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth in Gilead with him.

3. He asked: »Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?« Jehoshaphat replied: »I am ready when you are. My army is ready. We will join you.«

4. He added: »But first let us consult Jehovah.«

5. Ahab called in about four hundred prophets. He asked them: »Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?« »Attack it,« they answered. »God will give you victory.«

6. Jehoshaphat asked: »Is there another prophet through whom we can consult Jehovah?«

7. Ahab answered: »There is one more. He is Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me. It is always something bad.« Jehoshaphat replied: »You should not say that.«

8. Consequently King Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once.

9. The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, sat on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were prophesying in front of them.

10. One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab: This is what Jehovah says: »With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.«

11. All the other prophets said the same thing. »March against Ramoth and you will win,« they said. Jehovah will give you victory.

12. The official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him: All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king. You had better do the same.

13. But Micaiah answered: »By the living God Jehovah I will say what my God tells me to say.«

14. When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him: »Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?« »Attack!« Micaiah answered. »You will win! Jehovah will give you victory.«

15. Ahab replied: »When you speak to me in the name of Jehovah, tell the truth! How many times do I have to tell you that?«

16. Micaiah answered: »I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd.« Jehovah said: »These men have no leader. Let them go home in peace.«

17. Ahab said to Jehoshaphat: »I told you that he never prophesies anything good for me. It is always something bad!«

18. Micaiah continued: »Now listen to what Jehovah says! I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne in heaven. All his angels were standing beside him.«

19. Jehovah asked: »Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and get killed at Ramoth? Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else,

20. until a spirit stepped forward, approached Jehovah,« and said: »I will deceive him.« »How?« Jehovah asked.

21. The spirit replied: »I will go and make all of Ahabs prophets tell lies.« Jehovah said: »Go and deceive him. You will succeed.«

22. Micaiah concluded: »This is what has happened. Jehovah made these prophets of yours lie to you. But he has decreed that you will meet with disaster!«

23. Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah and slapped his face. He asked: »Since when did Jehovahs spirit leave me and speak to you?«

24. »You will find out when you go into some back room to hide,« Micaiah replied.

25. Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers: »Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash.«

26. Say: »This is what the king says: Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return home safely.«

27. Micaiah said: »If you really do come back safely, then Jehovah was not speaking through me. Pay attention to this, everyone!«

28. Thus the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead.

29. The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat: »I will disguise myself and go into battle. You, however, should wear your royal robes.« So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.

30. The king of Aram gave orders to the chariot commanders. He said: »Do not fight anyone except the king of Israel.«

31. When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said: »He must be the king of Israel.« So they surrounded him in order to fight him. When Jehoshaphat cried out Jehovah helped him. God drew them away from him.

32. Soon the chariot commanders realized that Jehoshaphat was not the king of Israel. Then they turned away from him.

33. One man aimed his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between his scale armor and his breastplate. Ahab told the chariot driver: »Turn around, and get me away from these troops for I am badly wounded.«

34. The battle raged on and King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. At sunset he died.

## 2 Chronicles 19

1. King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem.

2. A prophet, Jehu son of Hanani, went to meet the king. He said to him: »Do you think it is right to help those who are wicked and to take the side of those who hate Jehovah? What you have done has brought Jehovahs anger upon you.

3. »Regardless of this, there is some good in you. You have removed all the symbols of the goddess Asherah that people worshiped. You have tried to follow Gods will.«

4. While Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem, he regularly went to the people between Beersheba and the mountains of Ephraim. He brought the people back to Jehovah the God of their ancestors.

5. He appointed judges in the country, in each fortified city of Judah.

6. He told the judges: »Be careful when you make your decisions in court. Remember these are Jehovahs people. He will know the judgements you decide.

7. »Do your work in honor of him and know that he will not allow you to be unfair to anyone or to take bribes.«

8. Jehoshaphat also appointed some Levites, some priests, and some of the family leaders to serve as judges in Jerusalem.

9. He told them: »Faithfully serve Jehovah!

10. »Warn your relatives living in other cities about every case they bring to you, even if the case involves bloodshed or commandments, rules, or regulations derived from the law. Then your relatives will not become guilty in front of Jehovah. Otherwise, he will become angry with you and your relatives. Do this and you will not be guilty of anything.

11. »The chief priest Amariah will be in charge of you in every matter involving Jehovah. Zebadiah, who is the son of Ishmael and the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be in charge of every matter involving the king. The Levites will serve as officers of the court. Be strong and do your job. May Jehovah be with those who do right.«

## 2 Chronicles 20

1. Shortly after that the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat.

2. Some men reported to Jehoshaphat: »A large crowd is coming against you from the other side of the Dead Sea, from Edom. The crowd is already in Hazazon Tamar En Gedi.«

3. Jehoshaphat was frightened and decided to ask for Jehovahs help. He announced a fast throughout Judah.

4. The people of Judah gathered to seek Jehovahs help. They came from every city in Judah.

5. In the new courtyard at Jehovahs Temple, Jehoshaphat stood in front of the people.

6. He prayed aloud: »O Jehovah, God of our ancestors, you rule in heaven over all the nations of the world. You are powerful and mighty. No one can oppose you.

7. »You are our God. When your people Israel moved into this land, you drove out the people who were living here and gave the land to the descendants of Abraham, your friend, to be theirs from generation to generation.

8. »Our ancestors lived in this land and built a Temple to honor you.

9. »They believed that whenever this land is struck by war, judgement, disease, or famine, your people can pray to you at the Temple. You will hear their prayer and save them.

10. »You can see that the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Edom are attacking us! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt. Consequently these nations were not destroyed.

11. »They are now paying us back by coming to force us out of your land that you gave to us.

12. »You are our God. Will you judge them? We do not have the strength to face this large crowd that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, so we are looking to you.«

13. All the people from Judah, their infants, wives, and children were standing in front of Jehovah.

14. Then Jehovahs Spirit came to Jahaziel. He was the son of Zechariah, grandson of Benaiah, great-grandson of Jeiel, whose father was Mattaniah, a Levite descended from Asaph.

15. Jahaziel said: »Pay attention to me, everyone from Judah, everyone living in Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat. This is what Jehovah says to you: Do not be frightened or terrified by this large crowd. The battle is not yours. It is Gods.

16. »Attack them tomorrow as they come up the pass at Ziz. Meet them at the end of the valley that leads to the wild country near Jeruel.

17. »You will not have to fight this battle. Just take up your positions and wait. You will see Jehovah give you victory. People of Judah and Jerusalem, do not hesitate or be afraid. Go out to battle. Jehovah will be with you!

18. »Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low. His face was touching the ground. All the people bowed with him and worshiped Jehovah.

19. »The members of the Levite clans of Kohath and Korah stood up and with a loud shout praised Jehovah, the God of Israel.

20. »Early the next morning the people went out to the wild country near Tekoa. Before they began Jehoshaphat addressed them with these words: People of Judah and Jerusalem! Put your trust in Jehovah your God. You will stand your ground. Believe what his prophets tell you, and you will succeed.

21. »After consulting with the people, the king ordered some musicians to put on the robes they wore on sacred occasions and to march ahead of the army. They sang: Praise Jehovah! His love is eternal!«

22. As soon as they began singing, Jehovah confused the enemy camp,

23. The Ammonite and Moabite troops attacked and completely destroyed those from Edom. Then they turned against each other and fought until the entire camp was wiped out!

24. Judahs army reached the tower that overlooked the desert. They saw that every soldier in the enemys army was lying dead on the ground.

25. Jehoshaphat and his troops came to take the loot. They found among them a lot of goods, clothes, and valuables. They found more than they could carry. They spent three days collecting the loot.

26. They gathered in the valley of Beracah on the fourth day. Because they thanked Jehovah there, that place is still called the »Valley of Beracah« Thanks today.

27. All the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned to Jerusalem. They rejoiced while Jehoshaphat led them. Jehovah gave them a reason to rejoice about what had happened to their enemies.

28. They brought harps, lyres, and trumpets to Jehovahs Temple in Jerusalem.

29. Deep respect for Jehovah came over the kingdoms in that area when they heard how Jehovah waged war against Israels enemies.

30. Jehoshaphats kingdom was peaceful, since his God surrounded him with peace.

31. Jehoshaphat ruled as king of Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to rule. He ruled for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.

32. Jehoshaphat carefully followed the example his father Asa had set and did what Jehovah considered right.

33. However the illegal worship sites on the hills were not torn down. The people still did not have their hearts set on the God of their ancestors.

34. Everything else about Jehoshaphat from first to last is written in the records of Jehu, son of Hanani, which is included in the Book of the Kings of Israel.

35. After this, King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied himself with King Ahaziah of Israel, who led him to do evil.

36. Jehoshaphat joined him in making ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber.

37. Eliezer was the son of Dodavahu from Mareshah. He prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said: »Jehovah will destroy your work because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah.« The ships were wrecked and could not go to Tarshish.

## 2 Chronicles 21

1. Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in Davids City and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king.

2. Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah had six brothers: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah.

3. Their father gave them large amounts of gold, silver, and other valuable possessions, and placed each one in charge of one of the fortified cities of Judah. But because Jehoram was the oldest, Jehoshaphat made him his successor.

4. Jehoram was in firm control of the kingdom. He had all his brothers killed, and also some Israelite officials.

5. Jehoram became king at the age of thirty-two. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.

6. He followed the wicked example of King Ahab and the other kings of Israel. He married one of Ahabs daughters. He sinned against Jehovah.

7. Jehovah was not willing to destroy the dynasty of David. This is because he made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would always continue to rule.

8. During Jehorams time Edom rebelled against Judah and chose its own king.

9. Jehoram took all his chariot commanders to attack. The Edomites and their chariot commanders surrounded him. He got up during the night and broke through their lines.

10. So Edom rebelled against Judahs rule and is still independent today. At the same time Edom rebelled, Libnah rebelled because Jehoram had abandoned Jehovah the God of his ancestors.

11. Jehoram made illegal places of worship in the hills of Judah. This caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. So he led Judah astray.

12. A letter came to him from the prophet Elijah. It read: This is what Jehovah the God of your ancestor David says: You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of King Asa of Judah.

13. Instead, you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel. You, like Ahabs family, have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. You have killed your brothers, your fathers family. Your brothers were better than you.

14. Jehovah will strike a great blow to your people, your sons, your wives, and all your property because you did this.

15. You will be affected by a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die.

16. Later Jehovah caused the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians to become angry with Jehoram.

17. They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace. They led Jehorams wives and sons away as prisoners. The only one left behind was Ahaziah, his youngest son.

18. After this happened; Jehovah struck Jehoram with an incurable stomach disease.

19. Two years later Jehoram died in terrible pain. No bonfire was built to honor him. The people had done this for his ancestors, but not him.

20. Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king. He ruled eight years from Jerusalem. He died, and no one even felt sad. He was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs.

## 2 Chronicles 22

__KING AHAZIAH__

1. The people of Jerusalem made Jehorams youngest son Ahaziah king in his place, because the raiders who came to the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older sons. So Jehorams son Ahaziah became king of Judah.

2. Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to rule. He ruled for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.

3. Ahaziah also followed the ways of Ahabs family, because his mother gave him advice that led him to sin.

4. He did what Jehovah considered evil the same as Ahabs family had done. After his father died, they advised him to do what Ahabs family had done. They did this to destroy him.

5. He followed their advice. He joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead, and Joram was wounded in battle.

6. He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds. Ahaziah went there to visit him.

7. God used this visit to Joram to bring about Ahaziahs downfall. While Ahaziah was there, a man named Jehu confronted him and Joram. Jehu was the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah chose to destroy the dynasty of Ahab.

8. Jehu carried out Gods sentence on the dynasty. He came across a group made up of Judean leaders and of Ahaziahs nephews that had accompanied Ahaziah on his visit. Jehu killed them all.

9. A search was made for Ahaziah. He was found hiding in Samaria. They took him to Jehu and put him to death. But they did bury his body out of respect for his grandfather King Jehoshaphat, who had done all he could to serve Jehovah. No member of Ahaziahs family was left who could rule the kingdom.

10. When King Ahaziahs mother Athaliah learned of her sons murder, she gave orders for all the members of the royal family of Judah to be killed.

11. Ahaziah had a half sister, Jehosheba, who was married to a priest named Jehoiada. She secretly rescued one of Ahaziahs sons, Joash, took him away from the other princes who were about to be murdered. She hid him and a nurse in a bedroom at the Temple. By keeping him hidden, she saved him from death at the hands of Athaliah.

12. For six years he remained there in hiding, while Athaliah ruled as queen.

## 2 Chronicles 23

1. After a six-year wait Jehoiada the priest decided that it was time to take action. He made a pact with five army officers: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.

2. They went around Judah, gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the leaders of the families of Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

3. The entire assembly made an agreement with the king in Gods Temple. Then Jehoiada said to them: Here is the kings son. He should be king, as Jehovah said about Davids descendants.

4. You must do this: One third of you, the priests and Levites who are on duty on the day of worship, must guard the gates.

5. Another third must be at the royal palace. And another third must be at Foundation Gate. All the people must be in the courtyards of Jehovahs Temple.

6. Only the priests and Levites who are on duty should come into Jehovahs Temple. They may enter because they are holy. The other people should follow Jehovahs regulations.

7. The Levites should surround the king. Each man should have his weapon in his hand. Kill anyone who tries to come into the Temple. Stay with the king wherever he goes.

8. The Levites and all the Judeans did what the priest Jehoiada had ordered them. Each took his men who were coming on duty on the day of worship as well as those who were about to go off duty. Jehoiada did not dismiss the priestly divisions.

9. Jehoiada gave the commanders the spears and the small and large shields. They once belonged to King David but were now in Gods Temple.

10. The troops stood with their weapons drawn. They were stationed around the king, the altar and the Temple. They were located from the south side to the north side of the Temple.

11. Then they brought out the kings son and put the crown on him. They gave him the testimony and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. They said: »Long live the king!«

12. Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king. She entered into the house of Jehovah to the people.

13. She saw the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance. The captains and the trumpeters were beside the king. All the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. The singers with their musical instruments lead the praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said: »This is treason! Treason!«

14. Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area. He called out the army officers and said: »Take her out between the rows of guards. Kill anyone who tries to rescue her.«

15. They seized her and took her to the palace. There at the Horse Gate they killed her.

16. The priest Jehoiada had King Joash and the people join him. They made a covenant that they would be Jehovahs people.

17. Then they all went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols. Then they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.

18. Jehoiada put the priests and Levites in charge of the work of the Temple. They were to carry out the duties assigned to them by King David. This included burning the sacrifices offered to Jehovah in accordance with the Law of Moses. They were also in charge of the music and the celebrations.

19. Jehoiada appointed gatekeepers for the gates of Jehovahs temple. That way no one who was unclean for any reason could enter.

20. He took the company commanders, the nobles, the peoples governors, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king from Jehovahs Temple. They went through Upper Gate to the royal palace and seated the king on the royal throne. The nobles, the governors of the people, and

21. all the people of the land celebrated. The city was quiet because they had killed Athaliah with a sword.

## 2 Chronicles 24

__KING JOASH__

1. Joash began to rule when he was seven years old. He ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba.

2. Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, as long as the priest Jehoiada lived.

3. Jehoiada procured two wives for Joash and he had sons and daughters.

4. Joash wanted to renovate Jehovahs Temple.

5. He gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them: »Go to the cities of Judah, and collect money throughout Israel to repair the Temple of your God every year. Do it immediately!« But the Levites did not do it immediately.

6. The king called for the chief priest Jehoiada and asked him: »Why have you not required the Levites to bring the contributions from Judah and Jerusalem? Jehovahs servant Moses and the assembly required Israel to give contributions for the use of the Tent of Testimony of Gods promise.«

7. The sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into Gods Temple and used all the holy things of Jehovahs Temple to worship other gods, the Baals.

8. The king issued an order. They made a box and placed it outside the gate of Jehovahs Temple.

9. They issued a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem that the contributions should be brought to Jehovah. Moses required Israel to make contributions while they were in the desert.

10. All the officials and all the people were filled with joy. They brought money and dropped it into the box until it was full.

11. When the Levites brought the box to the kings officers and they saw a lot of money. The kings scribe and the chief priests officer would empty the box and put it back in its place. They would do this every day. They collected a lot of money.

12. The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the foremen who were working on Jehovahs Temple. They hired masons and carpenters to renovate Jehovahs Temple. They also hired men who worked with iron and bronze to repair Jehovahs Temple.

13. The men worked and the project progressed under the foremens guidance. They restored Gods Temple to its proper condition and reinforced it.

14. When the repairs were finished, the remaining gold and silver was given to the king and Jehoiada. They used it to have bowls and other utensils made for the Temple. As long as Jehoiada was alive, sacrifices were offered regularly at the Temple.

15. He died at the very old age of one hundred thirty years.

16. He was buried in the royal tombs in Jerusalem. This was because he had done so much good for the people of Israel, for God, and for the Temple.

17. After the death of Jehoiada the priest, the leaders of Judah went to Joash and talked him into doing what they wanted.

18. The people of Judah stopped worshiping in the Temple of Jehovah God. They started worshiping idols and the symbols of the goddess Asherah. These sinful things made Jehovah God angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem,

19. However he still sent prophets who warned them to turn back to him. The people refused to listen.

20. Gods Spirit spoke to Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. Zechariah told everyone that God was saying: »Why are you disobeying me and my Laws? This will only bring punishment! You have deserted me, so now I will desert you.«

21. They plotted against Zechariah. Then they followed the kings order and stoned him to death in the courtyard of Jehovahs Temple.

22. King Joash forgot that Zechariahs father had always been a loyal friend. So when the people of Judah plotted to kill Zechariah, Joash joined them and gave orders for them to stone him to death in the courtyard of the Temple. As Zechariah was dying, he said: »I pray that Jehovah will see this and punish all of you.«

23. The Aramean army attacked Joash at years end. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the peoples leaders. The Arameans sent all the loot they took from Judah and Jerusalem to the king of Damascus.

24. The Aramean army came with a small number of men. Jehovah handed Joashs large army over to them because Joashs soldiers had abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors. So the Arameans carried out Jehovahs judgment on Joash.

25. The Arameans withdrew. They left him suffering from many wounds. His own officials plotted against him for murdering the son of the priest Jehoiada. They killed Joash in his bed and buried him in the City of David. But they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.

26. These were the men who conspired against him: Zabad, son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith.

27. The record about his sons, the many divine revelations against him, and the rebuilding of Gods Temple is in the notes made in the Book of the Kings. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 25

__KING AMAZIAH__

1. Amaziah began to rule at age twenty-five. He ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan from Jerusalem.

2. He did what Jehovah considered right, but he did not do it wholeheartedly.

3. Once he had firm control over the kingdom, he executed the officials who killed his father, the former king.

4. He did not execute their children. He obeyed Jehovahs command written in the Book of Moses Teachings: »Parents must never be put to death for the crimes of their children, and children must never be put to death for the crimes of their parents. Each person must be put to death for his own crime.«

5. Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them by families to regiment and battalion commanders for all of Judah and Benjamin. He organized those who were at least twenty years old. He had three hundred thousand of the best men for the army, those who could handle a spear and a shield.

6. He also hired one hundred thousand soldiers from Israel for seven thousand and five hundred pounds of silver.

7. A man of God approached him and said: »Your Majesty, Israels army must not go with you. This is because Jehovah is not with Israel. He is not with these men from Ephraim.

8. »If you go into battle with them God will use the enemy to defeat you. It does not matter how courageous you are because God has the power to help you or to defeat you.«

9. Amaziah asked the man of God: »What should I do about the seven thousand and five hundred pounds of silver I gave the troops from Israel?« The man of God answered: »Jehovah can give you much more than that.«

10. Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim. They became furious with Judah and returned home.

11. Amaziah courageously led his troops. When he came to the Dead Sea region, he killed ten thousand men from Seir.

12. The Judeans captured another ten thousand alive. They took them to the top of a cliff, and threw them off the top of the cliff so that they were dismembered.

13. The troops that Amaziah sent back so that they couldnt go with him into battle raided the towns in Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and took a lot of goods.

14. After Amaziah came back from defeating the Edomites, he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down to them, and burned sacrifices to them.

15. Jehovah became angry with Amaziah. He sent him a prophet who asked: »Why do you dedicate your life to serving the gods of those people? Those gods could not save their own people from you!«

16. The king asked him: »Did we make you an adviser to the king? Stop! Do you want me to have you killed?« The prophet stopped. He said: »I know that God has decided to destroy you because you did this. Yet you refuse to listen to my advice.«

17. After receiving counsel from his advisers, King Amaziah of Judah sent messengers to King Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu of Israel, to declare war on Israel.

18. King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah: »A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon. It said: Let your daughter marry my son, but a wild animal from Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.

19. »You say you defeated Edom. Now you have become arrogant enough to look for more fame. Stay home! Why must you invite disaster and your own defeat and take Judah with you?«

20. But Amaziah would not listen. God made this happen because he wanted to hand over the Judeans to Jehoash because they had sought help from Edoms gods.

21. Thus King Jehoash of Israel attacked. King Amaziah of Judah met him in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah.

22. Israel defeated the army of Judah. The Judeans fled to their homes.

23. King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah, son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah of Judah, at Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem. He tore down a six hundred foot section of the wall around Jerusalem from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate.

24. He took all the gold, silver, and all the utensils he found in Gods temple with Obed Edom and in the royal palace treasury. He also took hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.

25. Joashs son King Amaziah of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoahazs son King Jehoash of Israel.

26. Everything else about Amaziah, from beginning to end, is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

27. Amaziah turned away from Jehovah. So conspirators in Jerusalem plotted against him. Amaziah fled to Lachish, but they sent men to Lachish after him and killed him there.

28. They brought him back by horse and buried him in the city of Judah with his ancestors.

## 2 Chronicles 26

__KING UZZIAH__

1. All the people of Judah took Uzziah and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.

2. Uzziah rebuilt Elath and returned it to Judah after King Amaziah slept in death.

3. Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to rule. He ruled for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem.

4. He did what Jehovah considered right, as his father Amaziah had done.

5. He dedicated his life to serving God in the days of Zechariah. Zechariah taught him to respect God. As long as he dedicated his life to serve God, Jehovah gave him success.

6. Uzziah went to wage war against the Philistines. He tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He built cities near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.

7. God helped him when he attacked the Philistines, the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunites.

8. The Ammonites paid taxes to Uzziah. His fame spread to the border of Egypt because he became very powerful.

9. Uzziah strengthened the fortifications of Jerusalem. He built towers at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and where the wall turned.

10. He also built fortified towers in the open country and dug many cisterns, because he had large herds of livestock in the western foothills and plains. Because he loved farming, he encouraged the people to plant vineyards in the hill country and to farm the fertile land.

11. He had a large army ready for battle. Its records were kept by his secretaries Jeiel and Maaseiah under the supervision of Hananiah, a member of the kings staff.

12. The total number of family heads among these warriors was twenty-six hundred.

13. They commanded an army of three hundred seven thousand and five hundred soldiers. They were a powerful force that could support the king against the enemy.

14. Uzziah prepared shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and stones for slings for the entire army.

15. In Jerusalem he manufactured machines designed by inventive people. The machines were placed on the towers and corners to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. Uzziahs fame spread far and wide because he had strong support until he became powerful.

16. However when he became powerful, his pride destroyed him. He was unfaithful to Jehovah his God. He went into Jehovahs Temple to burn incense on the incense altar.

17. Azariah the priest went in after him with eighty of Jehovahs courageous priests.

18. They opposed King Uzziah. They said to him: »Uzziah, you have no right to burn incense as an offering to Jehovah. That right belongs to the priests, Aarons descendants, who have been given the holy task of burning incense. Get out of the holy place because you have been unfaithful. Jehovah God will not honor you for this.«

19. Uzziah held an incense burner in his hand. He became angry. As his anger with the priests grew, a skin disease broke out on his forehead. This happened in front of the priests in Jehovahs Temple as Uzziah was at the incense altar.

20. When the chief priest Azariah and all the priests turned toward him, a skin disease was on his forehead. They rushed him away. Uzziah was in a hurry to get out because Jehovah had inflicted him with the disease.

21. King Uzziah had a skin disease until the day he died. Since he had a skin disease, he lived in a separate house and was barred from Jehovahs Temple. His son Jotham was in charge of the royal palace and governed the country.

22. Everything else about Uzziah is recorded by the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.

23. Uzziah lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with them in a field containing tombs that belonged to the kings. People said: »He has a skin disease.« His son Jotham succeeded him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 27

__KING JOTHAM__

1. Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to rule. He ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerushah, daughter of Zadok.

2. He did what Jehovah considered right, as his father Uzziah had done. Unlike his father, he did not illegally enter Jehovahs Temple. The people continued their corrupt ways.

3. Jotham built the Upper Gate of Jehovahs Temple and did extensive building of the wall at the Ophel.

4. He built cities in the hills of Judah. He also built forts and towers in the wooded areas.

5. He fought with the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites gave him seven thousand and five hundred pounds of silver, sixty thousand bushels of wheat, and sixty thousand bushels of barley. The Ammonites gave him the same amount for two more years.

6. Jotham grew powerful because he was determined to live the way Jehovah his God wanted.

7. Everything else about Jotham, all his wars and his life, is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

8. He was twenty-five years old when he began to rule as king. He ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem.

9. Jotham lay down in death with his ancestors. They buried him in the City of David. His son Ahaz succeeded him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 28

__KING AHAZ__

1. Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to rule. He ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what Jehovah considered right, as his ancestor David had done.

2. He followed the example of the kings of Israel. He even made metal idols for worshiping other gods such as the Baals.

3. He burned sacrifices in the valley of Ben Hinnom. He sacrificed his son by burning him alive. This was one of the disgusting things done by the nations that Jehovah had driven out from the land Israel possessed.

4. He offered sacrifices and burned incense as an offering at the illegal worship sites on hills and under every large tree.

5. Jehovah his God handed him over to the king of Aram, who defeated him, captured many prisoners, and brought them to Damascus. He also handed him over to the king of Israel, who decisively defeated him.

6. In one day Pekah, son of Remaliah, killed one hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah because they had abandoned Jehovah the God of their ancestors.

7. Zichri, a fighting man from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, who was the kings son, Azrikam, who was in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, who was the kings second-in-command.

8. The Israelites captured two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls from their relatives the Judeans. They also took a lot of goods from Judah and brought them to Samaria.

9. A prophet of Jehovah named Oded was there. He went to meet the army coming home to Samaria. He said: »Jehovah the God of your ancestors handed Judah over to you in his anger. You killed them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.

10. »Now you intend to enslave the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem. But are you not also guilty of sinning against Jehovah your God?

11. »Listen to me. Return the prisoners you have captured from your relatives, because Jehovah is very angry with you.«

12. Then Azariah, son of Jehohan, Berechiah, son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah, son of Shallum, and Amasa, son of Hadlai, some leaders of Ephraim, opposed those coming home from the army.

13. They said to the army: »Do not bring the prisoners here. You will make us responsible for this sin against Jehovah. Do you intend to add to all our sins? Jehovah is very angry at Israel because we have already sinned.«

14. Thus the army left the prisoners and the loot in front of the leaders and the whole assembly.

15. Then the men who were mentioned by name took charge of the prisoners and gave clothes from the loot to all the prisoners who were naked. They provided clothes for them, gave them sandals, gave them something to eat and drink, and let them bathe. They put everyone who was exhausted on donkeys and brought them to Jericho, the City of Palms, near their own people. Then they returned to Samaria.

16. King Ahaz then sent for help from the kings of Assyria.

17. The Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and captured prisoners.

18. The Philistines raided the foothills and the Negev in Judah. They captured and began living in Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco and its villages, Timnah and its villages, and Gimzo and its villages.

19. Jehovah humbled Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel. Ahaz had spread sin throughout Judah and was unfaithful to Jehovah.

20. King Tillegath Pilneser of Assyria attacked Ahaz. Instead of strengthening Ahaz, Tillegath Pilneser made trouble for him.

21. Ahaz took some of the things from Jehovahs temple, the royal palace, and the princes. He gave them to the king of Assyria. But that did not help him.

22. When he had this trouble, King Ahaz became more unfaithful to Jehovah!

23. He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus. These were the gods who had defeated him. He thought: »The gods of the kings of Aram are helping them. I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me. But they ruined him and all Israel.«

24. Ahaz collected the utensils in Gods Temple. He cut them up and closed the doors to Jehovahs Temple. He made altars for himself on every corner in Jerusalem.

25. And in each city of Judah, he made places of worship to sacrifice to other gods. He angered Jehovah the God of his ancestors.

26. Everything else about him from beginning to end is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

27. Ahaz slept in death with his ancestors. He was buried in the city of Jerusalem because they did not put him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 29

__KING HEZEKIAH__

1. Hezekiah began to rule as king when he was twenty-five years old. He ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah.

2. He did right in the eyes of Jehovah, as his ancestor David had done.

3. In the first month of his first year as king, he opened the doors of Jehovahs temple and repaired them.

4. He assembled the priests and Levites in the square on the east side of the temple.

5. He said: »Listen to me, Levites. Perform the ceremonies to make the temple of Jehovah the God of your ancestors holy. Remove anything that has been corrupted from the holy place.

6. »Our ancestors were unfaithful and did what Jehovah our God considered evil. They deserted him. They turned away from Jehovahs tent and turned their backs on him.

7. »They also shut the doors of the temples entrance hall. They extinguished the lamps, and did not burn incense or sacrifice burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.

8. »Jehovah was angry with Judah and Jerusalem. He made them something that shocks and terrifies people and that people ridicule, as you can see with your own eyes.

9. »Our fathers were killed in battle. Our sons, daughters, and wives are prisoners because of this.

10. »Now I intend to make a pledge to Jehovah the God of Israel so that he may turn his burning anger away from us.

11. »Do not be negligent, my sons. Jehovah has chosen you to stand in front of him, serve him, be his servants, and burn sacrifices.«

12. So the Levites started to work. From Kohaths descendants were Mahath, son of Amasai, and Joel, son of Azariah. From Meraris descendants were Kish, son of Abdi, and Azariah, son of Jehallelel. From Gershons descendants were Joah, son of Zimmah, and Eden, son of Joah.

13. From Elizaphans descendants were Shimri and Jeiel. From Asaphs descendants were Zechariah and Mattaniah.

14. From Hemans descendants were Jehiel and Shimei. From Jeduthuns descendants were Shemaiah and Uzziel.

15. These men gathered their relatives and performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy. They obeyed the kings order from Jehovahs word and entered the Temple to make it clean.

16. The priests entered Jehovahs temple to make it clean. They carried into the courtyard every unclean thing that they found in Jehovahs Temple. Then the Levites took the unclean items outside the city to the Kidron Brook.

17. They started on the first day of the first month. On the eighth day they went into Jehovahs entrance hall. For eight days they performed the ceremonies to make Jehovahs Temple holy. They finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.

18. Then they went to King Hezekiah. They said: »We have made Jehovahs entire temple clean. This includes the altar for burnt offerings, all its utensils, the table for the rows of bread and all its utensils,

19. and all the utensils King Ahaz refused to use during his reign when he was unfaithful. We have restored them and made them holy. They are in front of Jehovahs altar.«

20. Early in the morning Hezekiah assembled the leaders of the city and went to Jehovahs Temple.

21. They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as an offering for sin for the kingdom, the holy place, and Judah. Hezekiah told the priests, Aarons descendants, to sacrifice the animals on Jehovahs altar.

22. So they slaughtered the bulls. The priests sprinkled the blood on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. After that, they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.

23. Then they brought the male goats for the offering for sin in front of the king and the assembly, who laid their hands on them.

24. The priests killed the goats and poured their blood on the altar as a sacrifice to take away the sin of all the people. The king commanded that burnt offerings and sin offerings be made for all Israel.

25. The king followed the instructions Jehovah gave to King David through Gad, the kings prophet, and through the prophet Nathan. He stationed Levites in the Temple, with harps and cymbals,

26. and instruments like those that King David used. The priests also stood there with trumpets.

27. Hezekiah gave the order for the burnt offering to be presented. The offering began and the people sang praise to Jehovah. The musicians began to play the trumpets and all the other instruments.

28. Everyone there joined in worship. The singing and the rest of the music continued until all the sacrifices were burned.

29. King Hezekiah and all the people knelt down and worshiped God.

30. The king and the leaders of the nation told the Levites to sing to Jehovah the songs of praise that were written by David and by Asaph the prophet. So everyone sang with great joy as they knelt and worshiped God.

31. Hezekiah said to the people: »Now that you are ritually clean, bring sacrifices as offerings of thanksgiving to Jehovah.« They obeyed, and some of them also voluntarily brought animals to be sacrificed as burnt offerings.

32. They brought seventy bulls, one hundred sheep, and two hundred lambs as burnt offerings for Jehovah.

33. They also brought six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep as sacrifices for the people to eat.

34. Since there were not enough priests to kill all these animals, the Levites helped them until the work was finished. By then more priests had made themselves ritually clean. The Levites were more faithful in keeping ritually clean than the priests were.

35. In addition to offering the sacrifices that were burned whole, the priests were responsible for burning the fat that was offered from the sacrifices the people ate, and for pouring out the wine that was presented with the burnt offerings. Thus worship in the Temple began again.

36. King Hezekiah and the people were happy. For God helped them to do all this so quickly.

## 2 Chronicles 30

1. Hezekiah sent a message to all Israel and Judah. He wrote letters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. He invited them to come to Jehovahs Temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of Jehovah the God of Israel.

2. The king, his officials, and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.

3. They could not celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy and the people had not gathered in Jerusalem.

4. The king and the entire assembly considered their plan to be the right thing to do.

5. They decided to send an announcement throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan. They summoned everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of Jehovah God of Israel. These people had not celebrated it in large numbers as the written instructions said they should.

6. Messengers carried letters from the king and his officials throughout Israel and Judah. The kings order said: »Israelites should return to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. Then he will return to the few of you who escaped from the power of the kings of Assyria.

7. »Do not be like your ancestors and your relatives who were unfaithful to Jehovah the God of their ancestors. He made them something that shocks people, as you have seen.

8. »Do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, but yield to Jehovah and enter his sanctuary that he has consecrated from generation to generation. Serve Jehovah your God that His burning anger may turn away from you.

9. »If you return to Jehovah, your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land. Jehovah your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face away from you if you return to him.«

10. So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.

11. Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.

12. The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of Jehovah.

13. Many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month. It was a very large assembly.

14. They arose and removed the altars in Jerusalem. They also removed all the incense altars and cast them into the Kidron Brook.

15. They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves. They consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.

16. They stood in their regular places as instructed by the law of Moses. Moses was a man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites.

17. Many people in the assembly had not made themselves holy. So the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all who were not clean and could not make their lambs holy for Jehovah.

18. Many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not made themselves clean. So they ate the Passover, but not in the way the written instructions said they should. Hezekiah prayed for them: »May Jehovah forgive everyone

19. who have their hearts set on dedicating their lives to serve God. May Jehovah the God of their ancestors do this for those who are not clean as required for the holy place.«

20. Jehovah listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.

21. Thus the Israelites in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. Each day the Levites and priests praised Jehovah in song. They played Jehovahs instruments loudly.

22. Hezekiah spoke encouraging words to all the Levites who had the skills to serve Jehovah. They ate the festival meals for seven days, sacrificed fellowship offerings, and confessed their sins to Jehovah the God of their ancestors.

23. Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the festival for seven more days. So they joyfully celebrated for seven more days.

24. Hezekiah king of Judah contributed one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep to the assembly. The princes contributed one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep to the assembly. A large number of priests consecrated themselves.

25. The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced with the priests and the Levites. The entire assembly that came from Israel, both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah rejoiced.

26. There was great joy in Jerusalem. Nothing occurred like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.

27. The Levitical priests arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard and their prayer came to Gods holy dwelling place, to heaven.

## 2 Chronicles 31

1. When this ended, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherim and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh. They destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities, each to his possession.

2. Hezekiah assigned the priests and the Levites to divisions. Each priest or Levite was put in a division based on the service he performed. The services included: sacrificing burnt offerings, sacrificing fellowship offerings, serving, giving thanks, or praising within the gates of Jehovahs camp.

3. He set aside part of the kings property for burnt offerings, the morning and evening offerings, burnt offerings on the weekly worship days, the New Moon Festivals, and the annual festivals, as it is written in Jehovahs Law.

4. He told the people living in Jerusalem to give the priests and Levites the portions they were due so that they could devote themselves to Jehovahs Law.

5. As soon as the order was given, the people of Israel brought gifts of their finest grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and other farm produce, and they also brought the tithes of everything they had.

6. All the people who lived in the cities of Judah brought tithes of their cattle and sheep. They also brought large quantities of gifts they dedicated to Jehovah their God.

7. The gifts started arriving in the third month. They continued to pile up for the next four months.

8. King Hezekiah and his officials saw how much had been given. They praised Jehovah and praised his people Israel.

9. The king spoke to the priests and the Levites about these gifts,

10. and Azariah the High Priest, a descendant of Zadok, said to him: Since the people started bringing their gifts to the temple, there has been enough to eat and a large surplus besides. We have all this because Jehovah has blessed his people.

11. On the kings orders they prepared storerooms in the Temple area

12. and put all the gifts and tithes in them for safekeeping. They placed a Levite named Conaniah in charge and made his brother Shimei his assistant.

13. Ten Levites were assigned to work under them: Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. This was done by authority of King Hezekiah and Azariah the High Priest.

14. Kore son of Imnah, a Levite who was chief guard at the East Gate of the temple, was in charge of receiving the gifts offered to Jehovah and of distributing them.

15. In the other cities where priests lived, he was faithfully assisted in this by other Levites: Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the food equally to their fellow Levites according to what their duties were.

16. They were appointed to distribute them to males who were at least three years old. The way they were enrolled in the genealogical records did not matter. The six men who served under Kore were to distribute the offerings to everyone who went to Jehovahs Temple to perform the daily service that each division was responsible for.

17. They were to distribute offerings to the priests who were enrolled by families and to the Levites who were at least twenty years old. Distribution was based on the way they served in their divisions.

18. The priests and Levites were enrolled with their wives, sons, daughters, and other people who depended on them in the community. The priests and Levites had to be faithful in keeping themselves holy for the holy work.

19. Men were appointed to give a portion of the offerings to all the males in the priestly families and to everyone listed in the genealogies of the Levites. These men were Aarons descendants, priests who lived in the pasturelands of every Levite city.

20. This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what was good and right and true to Jehovah his God.

21. Hezekiah incorporated Moses teachings and commands into worship and dedicated his life to serving God. Whatever he did for the worship in Gods Temple, he did wholeheartedly, and he succeeded.

## 2 Chronicles 32

1. After everything Hezekiah had done so faithfully, King Sennacherib of Assyria came to invade Judah. He set up camp to attack the fortified cities. He intended to conquer them himself.

2. Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to wage war against Jerusalem,

3. He and his officers and military staff made plans to stop the water from flowing out of the springs outside the city. They helped him do it.

4. A large crowd gathered as they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land. They said: Why should the kings of Assyria find plenty of water?

5. Hezekiah worked hard. He rebuilt all the broken sections of the wall. He built the towers taller and built another wall outside the city wall. He strengthened the Millo in the City of David, and made plenty of weapons and shields.

6. He appointed military commanders over the troops and gathered the commanders in the square by the city gate. He spoke these words of encouragement:

7. Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened or terrified by the king of Assyria or the crowd with him. Someone greater is on our side.

8. Jehovah our God fights on our side. The Assyrians must rely on human power alone. These words encouraged the army of Judah.

9. Sennacherib and his troops were camped at the town of Lachish. He sent a message to Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem. It said:

10. »I am King Sennacherib of Assyria. I have Jerusalem surrounded. Do you think you can survive my attack?

11. »Hezekiah your king is telling you that Jehovah your God will save you from me. But he is lying! You will die of hunger and thirst.«

12. »Did Hezekiah not tear down all except one of Jehovahs altars and places of worship? And did he not tell you people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?

13. »You have heard what my ancestors and I have done to other nations. Were the gods of those nations able to defend their land against us?

14. »None of those gods kept their people safe from the kings of Assyria. Do you really think your God can do any better?

15. »Do not be fooled by Hezekiah! No god of any nation has been able to stand up to Assyria. Believe me, your God cannot keep you safe!«

16. Sennacheribs officers said more against Jehovah God and his servant Hezekiah.

17. Sennacherib wrote letters cursing Jehovah the God of Israel. These letters said: The gods of the nations in other countries could not rescue their people from me. Hezekiahs God cannot rescue his people from me.

18. Sennacheribs officers shouted loudly in the Judean language to the troops who were on the wall of Jerusalem. They tried to frighten and terrify the troops so that they could capture the city.

19. They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of the hands of man.

20. King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, prayed about this and called to heaven.

21. Jehovah sent an angel who exterminated all the soldiers, officials, and commanders in the Assyrian kings camp. Sennacherib was humiliated and returned to his own country. When he went into the temple of his god, some of his own sons killed him with a sword.

22. So Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem from King Sennacherib of Assyria and from everyone else. Jehovah gave them peace with all their neighbors.

23. Many people still went to Jerusalem to bring gifts to Jehovah and expensive presents to King Hezekiah of Judah. From that point in history he was considered important by all the nations.

24. Hezekiah became sick and was about to die. He prayed to Jehovah, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.

25. But Hezekiah was conceited. So he did not repay Jehovah for his kindness. Jehovah became angry with him, with Judah, and with Jerusalem.

26. Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem humbled themselves when they realized they had become conceited. Thus Jehovah did not vent his anger on them during Hezekiahs time.

27. Hezekiah became richer and was highly honored. He prepared storehouses for himself to hold silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuables.

28. He built storehouses for the produce of grain and wine and oil; and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks.

29. He made towns for himself. He gathered much property in flocks and herds: for God had given him great wealth.

30. It was Hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of Gihon stopped, and the water taken down on the west side of the town of David. Hezekiah did well in everything he tried.

31. When the leaders of Babylon sent ambassadors to ask him about the miraculous sign that had happened in the land, God left him. God did this to test him, to find out everything that was in Hezekiahs heart.

32. Everything else about Hezekiah, including his devotion to God, is written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, and in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel.

33. Hezekiah slept in death with his ancestors. He was buried in the upper tombs of Davids descendants. When Hezekiah died, all of Judah and the people in Jerusalem honored him. His son Manasseh succeeded him as king.

## 2 Chronicles 33

__KING MANASSEH__

1. Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king. He ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.

2. He did what Jehovah considered evil by copying the disgusting things done by the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from before the Israelites.

3. He rebuilt the illegal places of worship that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He set up altars dedicated to other gods such as the Baals. He erected a pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah as King Ahab of Israel had done. Manasseh, like Ahab, worshiped and served the entire army of heaven.

4. He built altars in Jehovahs Temple, of which Jehovah said: »My name will be in Jerusalem from generation to generation.«

5. He built altars for the entire army of heaven in the two courtyards of Jehovahs Temple.

6. He burned his son as a sacrifice in the valley of Ben Hinnom, he consulted fortunetellers, and he cast evil spells. He also practiced witchcraft, and appointed royal mediums and psychics. He did many things that made Jehovah furious.

7. Manasseh had a carved idol made. Then he set it up in Gods Temple, where God had said to David and his son Solomon: »I have chosen this temple and Jerusalem from all the tribes of Israel. I will put my name here from generation to generation.

8. »I will never again remove Israel from the land that I set aside for their ancestors if they will obey all the commandments, all the teachings, the ordinances, and the regulations I gave through Moses.«

9. Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that they did more evil things than the nations that Jehovah destroyed when the Israelites arrived in the land.

10. Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and his people. But they would not pay attention.

11. So Jehovah made the army commanders of the king of Assyria invade Judah. They took Manasseh captive, put a hook in his nose, put him in bronze shackles, and brought him to Babylon.

12. When he experienced distress, he begged Jehovah his God to be kind and humbled himself in front of the God of his ancestors.

13. He prayed to Jehovah. And Jehovah accepted his prayer and listened to his request. Jehovah brought him back to his kingdom in Jerusalem. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah is God.

14. Then Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon Spring in the valley to the entrance of Fish Gate. He made the wall go around the Ophel. He built it very high. He put army commanders in every fortified city in Judah.

15. Manasseh also removed the foreign gods and the idol in Jehovahs Temple. He eliminated the altars he had built in the Temple on Jehovahs mountain and in Jerusalem.

16. He built Jehovahs altar and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it. And he told Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.

17. However the people continued to sacrifice at the illegal places of worship. But they sacrificed only to Jehovah their God.

18. Everything else about Manasseh, including his prayer to his God and the words that the seers spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel are in the records of the kings of Israel.

19. His prayer and how God accepted it are written in the records of Hozai. The things he did before he humbled himself are also written there. This includes all his sins and unfaithfulness and the places where he built illegal worship sites and set up idols and poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah.

20. Manasseh lay down in death with his ancestors. They buried him in his own palace. His son Amon succeeded him as king.

21. Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king. He ruled for two years in Jerusalem.

22. He did what Jehovah considered evil, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon sacrificed to all the idols his father Manasseh had made, and he worshiped them.

23. He did not humble himself in front of Jehovah as his father Manasseh had humbled himself. Instead, Amon continued to sin.

24. His officials conspired against him and killed him in his palace.

25. The people of the land killed everyone who conspired against King Amon. They made his son Josiah king in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 34

__KING JOSIAH__

1. Josiah was eight years old when he became king. He was king for thirty-one years in Jerusalem.

2. He did what Jehovah considered right. He lived in the ways of his ancestor David and never stopped living this way.

3. It was the eighth year of his reign. He was still a boy when he dedicated his life to service of the God of his ancestor David. In his twelfth year as king he purged Judah and Jerusalem by destroying the illegal places of worship, poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah, carved idols, and metal idols.

4. He tore down the altars of the Baal gods. He cut down the incense altars that were above them. He destroyed the Asherah poles, carved idols, and metal idols. He ground them into powder and scattered the powder over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them.

5. He burned the bones of the priests on their altars. Thus he made Judah and Jerusalem clean.

6. In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, he removed all their temples.

7. Then he tore down the altars, beat the Asherah poles and idols into powder, and cut down all the incense altars everywhere in Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.

8. In his eighteenth year as king as he was making the land and the temple clean, Josiah sent Shaphan, son of Azaliah, Maaseiah, the mayor of the city, and Joah, the royal historian and son of Joahaz, to repair the Temple of Jehovah his God.

9. They came to the chief priest Hilkiah and gave him the money that had been brought into Gods Temple. It was the money that the Levite doorkeepers had collected from the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all who were left in Israel, from everyone in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

10. They gave the money to the foremen who were in charge of Jehovahs Temple. These foremen gave it to the workmen who were restoring and repairing the Temple.

11. These workers included carpenters and builders. They were to buy quarried stones and wood for the fittings and beams of the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to become run-down.

12. The men did their work faithfully under the supervision of Jahath and Obadiah; Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam descendants of Kohath. The Levites, who were skilled musicians,

13. also supervised the workers and directed all the workmen on the various jobs. Some of the Levites served as scribes, officials, or gatekeepers.

14. At the time they brought out the money that had been deposited in Jehovahs Temple, the priest Hilkiah found the book of Jehovahs Law written by Moses.

15. Hilkiah told the scribe Shaphan: »I have found the book of the Law in Jehovahs Temple.« Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.

16. Shaphan took the book to the king and reported: »We are doing everything you told us to do.

17. »We took the money that was donated in Jehovahs Temple and gave it to the supervisors and the workmen.«

18. The scribe Shaphan told the king: »The priest Hilkiah has given me a book.« Shaphan read it to the king.

19. As soon as the king heard what the Law said, he tore his clothes in distress.

20. Then the king gave an order to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, the scribe Shaphan, and the royal official Asaiah. He said:

21. »On behalf of those who are left in Israel and Judah and me, ask Jehovah about the words in this book that was found. Jehovahs fierce anger has been poured on us because our ancestors did not obey the word of Jehovah by doing everything written in this book.«

22. Hilkiah and the kings officials went to talk to the prophet Huldah about this matter. She was the wife of Shallum, son of Tokhath and grandson of Hasrah. Shallum was in charge of the royal wardrobe. Huldah was living in the Second Part of Jerusalem.

23. She told them: »This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: »Tell the man who sent you to me,

24. »This is what Jehovah says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and on the people living here. This is according to the curses written in the book that was read to the king of Judah.

25. »I will do this because they have abandoned me. They have sacrificed to other gods in order to make me furious. Therefore, my anger will be poured on this place and it will not be extinguished.«

26. Huldah continued: »Tell Judahs king who sent you to me to ask Jehovah a question: This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says about the words you heard:

27. »»You had a change of heart and humbled yourself in front of God when you heard my words against this place and those who live here. You humbled yourself, tore your clothes in distress, and cried in front of me. So I will listen to you, proclaims Jehovah.

28. »That is why I am going to bring you to your ancestors. I am going to bring you to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see any of the disaster I am going to bring on this place and those who live here.« « They reported this to the king.

29. The king sent for all the respected leaders of Judah and Jerusalem to join him.

30. The king, everyone in Judah, everyone living in Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, young and old, went up to Jehovahs Temple. He read everything written in the Book of the Covenant found in Jehovahs Temple so that they could hear it.

31. The king stood in his place and made a promise to Jehovah that he would follow Jehovah and obey his commandments, instructions, and laws with his entire heart and being. He said he would live by the terms of the covenant promise written in this book.

32. He also made all those found in Jerusalem and Benjamin join with him in the covenant. Then the people of Jerusalem lived according to the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.

33. Josiah got rid of all the disgusting idols throughout Israelite territory. He required all people in Israel to serve Jehovah their God. As long as he lived, they did not stop following Jehovah the God of their ancestors.

## 2 Chronicles 35

1. Josiah celebrated the Passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem. The Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.

2. Josiah appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them to serve in Jehovahs Temple.

3. He told the Levites, who instructed all Israel and performed ceremonies to make themselves holy to Jehovah: Put the Holy Ark in the Temple that Solomon, son of David and king of Israel, built. It should not be carried on your shoulders any longer. Serve Jehovah your God and his people Israel.

4. Get yourselves ready with the family groups of your divisions, which are listed in the records of King David of Israel and the records of his son Solomon.

5. »Divide yourselves into groups. Then spread out throughout the Temple so that each family of worshipers will be able to get help from one of you.

6. »When the people bring you their Passover lamb, you must slaughter it and prepare it to be sacrificed to Jehovah. Make sure the people celebrate according to the instructions Jehovah gave Moses. Do not do anything to become unclean and unacceptable.«

7. Josiah donated thirty thousand sheep and goats, and three thousand bulls from his own flocks and herds for the people to offer as sacrifices.

8. Josiahs officials also voluntarily gave some of their animals to the people, the priests, and the Levites as sacrifices. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, who were the officials in charge of the Temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred sheep and lambs and three hundred bulls to sacrifice during the Passover celebration.

9. Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, gave the Levites five thousand sheep and goats and five hundred bulls as Passover sacrifices.

10. Thus the service was prepared. The priests took their positions with the Levites according to their divisions, as the king had ordered.

11. They slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests sprinkled the blood with their hands while the Levites skinned the lambs.

12. They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the people according to their family divisions. The people could then present them to Jehovah as is written in the Book of Moses. The Levites did the same with the bulls.

13. The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire, according to the regulations. They boiled the sacred offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and quickly distributed the meat to the people.

14. After this was done, the Levites provided meat for themselves and for the priests descended from Aaron. Since the priests were kept busy until night, burning the animals that were burned whole and the fat of the sacrifices.

15. The following musicians of the Levite clan of Asaph were in the places assigned to them by King Davids instructions: Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the kings prophet. The guards at the Temple gates did not need to leave their posts, because the other Levites prepared the Passover for them.

16. Everything was done that day as King Josiah commanded for the worship of Jehovah. This included the keeping of the Passover Festival, and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar.

17. All the people of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.

18. The Passover had not been celebrated like this since the days of the prophet Samuel. None of the former kings had ever celebrated a Passover like this one celebrated by King Josiah, the priests, the Levites, and the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem

19. This was the eighteenth year of Josiahs reign.

20. Later, when Josiah had repaired the Temple, King Necho of Egypt came to fight a battle at Carchemish at the Euphrates River. Josiah went to attack him.

21. Neco sent messengers to Josiah. He said: »What is your quarrel with me, king of Judah? I am not attacking you. I have come to fight those who are at war with me. God told me to hurry. God is with me, so stop now or he will destroy you.«

22. But Josiah would not stop his attack. He disguised himself as he went into battle. He refused to listen to Nechos words, which came from God. He went to fight in the valley of Megiddo.

23. Some archers shot King Josiah. The king told his officers: »Take me away because I am badly wounded.«

24. His officers took him out of the chariot and brought him to Jerusalem in his other chariot. He died and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

25. Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah. All the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations dirges to this day. They made them an ordinance in Israel. They are also written in the Lamentations.

26. The rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the law of Jehovah,

27. and his acts, first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 36

__KING JEHOAHAZ__

1. The people of the land crowned Josiahs son Jehoahaz as their new king in Jerusalem in place of his father.

2. Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king. He was king in Jerusalem for three months.

3. The king of Egypt removed him from office in Jerusalem and fined the country seven thousand five hundred pounds of silver and seventy-five pounds of gold.

4. The king of Egypt made Jehoahazs brother Eliakim king of Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakims name to Jehoiakim. Necho took Jehoahaz away to Egypt.

5. Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king. He ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what Jehovah his God considered evil.

6. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Jehoiakim and put him in bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.

7. Nebuchadnezzar also brought some of the utensils of Jehovahs Temple to Babylon. He put them in his palace temple in Babylon.

8. Everything about Jehoiakim, the disgusting things he did and all the charges against him are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. His son Jehoiakin succeeded him as king.

9. Jehoiakin was eight years old when he began to rule as king. He was king for three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what Jehovah considered evil.

10. In the spring King Nebuchadnezzar sent for Jehoiakin and brought him to Babylon with the valuable utensils from Jehovahs Temple. Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiakins uncle Zedekiah king of Judah and Jerusalem.

11. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to rule. He ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem.

12. He did what Jehovah his God considered evil. He did not humble himself in front of the prophet Jeremiah, who spoke Jehovahs word.

13. Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah swear an oath of allegiance to him in Gods name. But Zedekiah became so stubborn and so impossible to deal with that he refused to turn back to Jehovah the God of Israel.

14. All the officials, the priests, and the people became increasingly unfaithful and followed all the disgusting practices of the nations. Although Jehovah made the Temple in Jerusalem holy, they made the Temple unclean.

15. Jehovah the God of their ancestors repeatedly sent messages through his prophets because he wanted to spare his people and his dwelling place.

16. They mocked Gods messengers. They despised his words, and made fun of his prophets until Jehovah became angry with his people. He could no longer heal them.

17. So he had the Babylonian king attack them and execute their best young men in their holy temple. He did not spare the best men or the unmarried women, the old people or the sick people. God handed all of them over to him.

18. He brought to Babylon each of the utensils from Gods temple, the treasures from Jehovahs Temple, and the treasures of the king and his officials.

19. He burned down the Temple and the city, with all its palaces and its wealth, and broke down the city wall.

20. The survivors were taken to Babylonia as prisoners. They served as slaves of the king and his sons, until Persia became a powerful nation.

21. This fulfilled the word of Jehovah that was spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept Sabbath until seventy years were complete.

22. In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia. He sent a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also put it in writing. He said:

23. Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: »Jehovah, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up!«
