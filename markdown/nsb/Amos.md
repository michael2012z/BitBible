## Amos 1

__(Writer: Amos, means Carrying a Load) (804 B.C.E.) (Judah)__

1. The words of Amos concerning Israel. He was among the herdsmen of Tekoa in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel. It was two years before the earthquake.

2. He said: »Jehovah roars from Zion! He utters his voice from Jerusalem! The pastures of the shepherds mourn for lack of water. The top of Carmel withers.«

3. »I will not hold back punishment,« said Jehovah, »For the many transgressions of Damascus. This is because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.

4. »I will send fire to the house of Hazael and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.

5. »I will destroy the lock bar at the gate of Damascus, and annihilate the inhabitant from the valley of Aven. He who holds the scepter imperial authority from the house of Eden and the people of Syria will go into captivity to Kir,« said Jehovah.

6. Jehovah said: »I will not withdraw punishment from Gaza for they transgressed many times. They captured all the people and delivered them to Edom.

7. »I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza. It will devour the palaces there.

8. »I will destroy the inhabitant of Ashdod. I will kill the king of Ashkelon who holds the scepter. I will direct my power against Ekron. The remnant of the Philistines will perish,« said the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.

9. Jehovah continued: »For the many transgressions of Tyre I will not withdraw punishment! They captured all the people and delivered them to Edom. They did not remember the brotherly covenant.

10. »I will send fire on the walls of Tyre. It will devour the palaces.«

11. Jehovah declared: »For three and four transgressions of Edom, I will not withdraw punishment. He pursued his brother with the sword. He showed no compassion but was driven with anger and eternal wrath.

12. »I will send a fire upon Teman, and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah.«

13. Jehovah also said: »For the many transgressions of the children of Ammon I will not withdraw the punishment. They have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.

14. »I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah and devour its palaces. The battle cry in the day of battle will be heard and a storm in the day of the windstorm.

15. »Their king and his princes will go into captivity,« said Jehovah.

## Amos 2

1. Jehovah said: »I will not withdraw punishment for the many transgressions of Moab. He burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.

2. »I will send a fire to Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth. Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet!

3. »I will destroy her ruler and government officials along with him,« said Jehovah.

4. Jehovah continued: »I will not withdraw punishment for the many transgressions of Judah. For they have rejected the Law of Jehovah! They have not kept his statutes. Their lies have led them astray, those after which their fathers walked.

5. »I will send fire upon Judah and it will devour the fortified buildings of Jerusalem.«

6. Jehovah said: »I will not withdraw punishment for three sins of Israel, even for four the many transgressions of Israel! They sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.

7. »They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of lowly meek persons. They reject the humble! A man and his father have sexual relations with the same maiden, to profane my holy name.

8. »They lie down beside every altar on clothes taken from indebtedness. In the house of their God they drink the wine they have confiscated.

9. »Before them I destroyed the Amorite. His height was like the height of the cedars. He was strong like the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath!

10. »I brought you out of the land of Egypt. I led you forty years in the desert wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

11. »I ordained some of your sons for prophets and some of your young men for Nazirites dedicated ones. Is this true, O you children of Israel?« : said Jehovah.

12. »But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying: Do Not Prophesy!

13. »Consider this, I will weigh you down just as a wagon is weighed down when it is full of grain.

14. »Flight will perish from the swift! The strong will not increase his strength. The mighty will not save himself.

15. »The archer will not stand. The swift of foot will not save himself. The horseman will not deliver himself.

16. »The courageous among the mighty will run away naked in that day,« said Jehovah.

## Amos 3

1. Hear this word Jehovah spoke against you, O children of Israel! It is against the whole family that I brought out of the land of Egypt:

2. »Of all the families of the earth I have chosen known only you. Therefore I will punish you for all your sins.

3. »Will two walk together, except they cooperate collaboratehave an agreement?

4. »Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out from his den if he has captured nothing?

5. »Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where there is no trap for him? Will a trap spring up from the ground when nothing at all sprung it?

6. »Will the trumpet be blown in a city and the people not be afraid? Will disaster happen to a city and Jehovah not cause it?

7. »The Lord Jehovah will do nothing without revealing his secrets to his servants the prophets.

8. »The lion has roared. Who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken! Who will not prophesy?«

9. »Publish it in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt. Proclaim and assemble on the mountains of Samaria, and observe the great trouble and oppression there.

10. »Those who store up violence and robbery in their dwellings do not know how to do what is right,« declared Jehovah.

11. The Lord Jehovah spoke these words: »An adversary will surround the land. He will defeat and tear down your defenses. He will plunder your dwellings.«

12. Jehovah said: »As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so the children of Israel will be rescued. They sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.

13. »Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,« said the Lord Jehovah, the God of Hosts.

14. »The day that I punish Israel because of her sins I will also punish those at the altars of Bethel! The horns of the altar will be cut off, and fall to the ground.

15. »I will strike destroy the winter house and the summer house. The houses of ivory will perish, and the great houses will come to an end,« said Jehovah.

## Amos 4

1. »Hear this word you cows of Bashan who live on the mountain of Samaria. You oppress the poor. You crush the needy. You say to your masters husbandslords, »Bring us drink.«

2. »The Lord Jehovah has sworn by his holiness that the day will come when they will take you away with meat hooks, and those who remain with fish-hooks.

3. »You will go out through the holes in the city wall straight before her. You will be thrown into Harmon a place of exile,« said Jehovah.

4. »Come to Bethel and transgress! Come to Gilgal and multiply transgression! Bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes every three days.

5. »Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened. Proclaim freewill-offerings and make them known. This pleases you, O you children of Israel,« said the Lord Jehovah.

6. »I also gave you cleanness of teeth kept food from your teeth in all your cities and lack of bread in all your places. Yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.

7. »I withheld rain from you three months before the harvest. I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city. One received rain. The other did not receive rain and it dried up.

8. »Two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water. They were not satisfied and yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.

9. »I struck you with scorching and mildew. The caterpillar has devoured the multitudes of your gardens, your vineyards, your fig trees and your olive-trees. Yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.

10. »I sent a plague among you just as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword and I captured your horses. I made the stench of your camp come up even into your nostrils and yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.

11. »I overthrew your cities as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire. Yet you have not returned to me,« said Jehovah.

12. »This is what I will do to you, O Israel. Because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel!

13. »Behold he who formed the mountains and created the wind and declared to man his thoughts, also made the morning darkness and treads upon the high places of the Earth: Jehovah, the God of Hosts, is his name.«

## Amos 5

1. Hear this word that I take up for a cry of sorrow lamentationdirge over you, O house of Israel.

2. The virgin of Israel has fallen. She will not rise again. She has been thrown down upon her own land. There is none to raise her up.

3. The Sovereign and Almighty Lord Jehovah declared: »The city that went forth a thousand will have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred will have ten left, for the house of Israel.«

4. Jehovah said to the house of Israel: »Seek me and you will live!

5. »Do not seek Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal. Do not pass to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into captivity exile, and Bethel will come to nothing.

6. »Seek Jehovah, and you will live. Lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it will devour, and there will be none to quench it in Bethel.

7. You who turn justice to wormwood a curse, and cast righteousness down to the earth

8. seek the creator of the cluster of stars named Pleiades and the star constellation Orion. He turns the shadow of death into morning, and makes the day dark with night. He calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth. Jehovah is his name!

9. He brings sudden destruction upon the strong. Destruction comes upon the fortress.

10. You hate the one who reproves in the gate, and abhor him who speaks the truth with integrity.

11. You impose unfair rent on the poor and defraud a tribute of grain from them. You haave built houses of hewn stone yet you will not live in them. You planted pleasant vineyards, but you will not drink the wine from them.

12. I know you have many transgressions and your sins are great. You afflict the righteous. You take bribes. You refuse to help the needy at the gate.

13. The prudent will keep silent for it is an evil time.

14. »Seek good and not evil, that you may live. Jehovah, the God of Hosts, will be with you, as you have said.

15. »Hate evil, and love good! Establish justice in the gate. It may be that Jehovah, the God of Hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.«

16. Listen to Jehovah the God of Hosts, the Almighty: Wailing will be in all the broad ways. They will say in all the streets, »Alas! Alas!« They will call the farmer to mourning, and the professional mourner to lamentation and crying.

17. »All vineyards will lament. For I will pass through your midst,« said Jehovah.

18. »Woe to you who desire the day of Jehovah! What will the day of Jehovah mean to you? It is darkness, and not light.

19. »Like a man who ran from a lion, and a bear met him! So he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

20. »Will the day of Jehovah be darkness with no light? Will it be very dark, and no brightness in it?

21. »I hate, I despise reject your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.

22. »Yes, even if you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, I will not accept them. Neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.

23. »Take the noise of your songs away from me! I will not listen to the melody of your harps.

24. »Justice should roll down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream.

25. »Did you bring sacrifices and offerings to me in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?

26. »You have carried the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.

27. »Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity exile beyond Damascus,« said the God of Hosts, whose name is Jehovah.

## Amos 6

1. »Those who are at ease in Zion and are secure in the mountain of Samaria will have trouble. You are the notable men of the foremost nations to whom the house of Israel comes!

2. »Travel to Calneh and observe. From there go to the great Hamath. Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better off than these kingdoms? Is their territory greater than your territory?

3. »You put far away the evil day and cause the place of violence to come near.

4. »You lie on beds of ivory, and stretch on couches. You eat the the best lambs out of the flock and the fattest calves out of the stall.

5. »You sing idle songs to the sound of the harp and like David you improvise on musical instruments.

6. »You drink wine in bowls, and anoint yourselves with the finest oils. But you are not grieved because of the affliction of Joseph.

7. »Therefore you will be captured with the first that go captive. Your feasting and lounging will pass away.«

8. The Lord Jehovah has sworn by himself. Jehovah, the God of Hosts declares: »I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his palaces. Therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it.

9. »It will happen! If there remain ten men in one house, they will die.

10. »When a man's uncle takes the body to be burned and brings the bones out of the house he will say to the innermost parts of the house: Is there yet any one here? And he will say, No. Then he will say: Hold your peace. We may not make mention of the name of Jehovah.

11. »For, behold, Jehovah commanded, and the great house will be struck to pieces and the little house to tiny bits.

12. »Do horses run upon the rock? Will one plow there with cattle? You have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood bitterness!

13. »You who rejoice in Lodebar, you say, have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim?

14. »For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel,« said Jehovah, the God of Hosts. »They will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.«

## Amos 7

1. This is what the Lord Jehovah showed me: Behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the sprouting of the second crop. It was the later growth second crop after the kings mowing.

2. It happened when they quit eating the grass of the land. I said, »O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I entreat you: how shall Jacob stand? Since he is so small.«

3. Jehovah changed his mind about this. »It will not be,« said Jehovah.

4. The Lord Jehovah showed me and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called for judgement contention by fire and it devoured the great deep. It would have eaten up the land.

5. Then I said, »O Lord Jehovah, cease, I plead with you: how can Jacob stand? After all he is small.«

6. Jehovah changed his mind concerning this: »This also will not be,« said the Lord Jehovah.

7. He showed me: and, behold, Jehovah stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.

8. And Jehovah asked me, »Amos, what do you see?« I said: »A plumb line.« Then Jehovah said: »Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel. I will not spare them any more.

9. »The high places of Isaac will be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste. I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.«

10. Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: »Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.«

11. Amos said: »Jeroboam will die by the sword. Israel will surely be led away captive in exile out of his land.«

12. Amaziah said to Amos: »Go, run away, you seer. Go into the land of Judah. Eat bread and prophesy there.

13. »Do not prophesy any more at Bethel for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.«

14. Amos told Amaziah, »I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son. I was a herdsman, and a grower of sycamore figs.

15. »Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me: Go prophesy to my people Israel.«

16. Now hear the word of Jehovah: »You say, do not prophesy against Israel, and do not speak against the house of Isaac.«

17. Jehovah proclaims: »Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be divided by measuring line. You will die in a land that is unclean. Israel will surely be led away captive out of his land.«

## Amos 8

1. The Lord Jehovah showed me a basket of summer fruit.

2. He said: »Amos, what do you see?« And I said, »A basket of summer fruit.« Then Jehovah said to me: »The end has come to my people Israel. I will spare them no longer.

3. »The songs of the Temple will be weeping in that day,« said the Lord Jehovah: »the dead bodies shall be many. They will observe silence in every place.

4. »Hear this, you who would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail.

5. »You say: When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit.

6. »We may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

7. »Jehovah has sworn by the pride of Jacob: I will never forget any of their works.

8. »Will the land not tremble for this, and every one who dwells there mourn? I will rise up like the river. It will be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.

9. »It will happen in that day,« said the Lord Jehovah, »that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.

10. »I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation dirges. I will bring sackcloth on all loins and baldness on every head. I will make it as the mourning for an only son like the end of a bitter day.

11. »Behold, the day is coming,« said the Lord Jehovah, »that I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.

12. »They will wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east. They will run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and will not find it.

13. »In that day the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.

14. »They who swear by the sin of Samaria. They will say: As your god lives, O Dan, the way Beersheba lives. They will fall and never rise up again.«

## Amos 9

1. I saw Jehovah standing beside the altar. He said: »Strike the capitals that the thresholds may shake! Break them in pieces on the head of all of them and I will slay the last of them with the sword. Not one of them will get away. Not one of them will escape!

2. »Though they dig into the grave my hand will take them. Though they climb to heaven I will bring them down.

3. »Though they hide on top of Mount Carmel I will search and find them and take them from there. Though they hide from my sight on the bottom of the sea I will command the serpent to bite them.

4. »Though they go into the captivity of their enemies I will command the sword, and it will slay them. I will set my eyes against them for evil, and not for good.

5. »For the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, is he who touches the land and it melts. All who live there will mourn. It will rise up like the River Nile, and will subside again, like the River of Egypt.

6. »He builds his chambers in the heavens. He founded his dome over the earth. He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth. Jehovah is his name.

7. »Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel?« Said Jehovah. »Have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?

8. »Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom! Yet, I will destroy it from off the face of the earth! I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,« said Jehovah.

9. I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations! Like grain is sifted in a sieve, yet the least kernel will not fall on the earth.

10. »All the sinners of my people will die by the sword. They say: The evil will not overtake nor meet us.

11. »In that day I will raise up the fallen tabernacle of David and close up the breaches. I will raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old.

12. »They may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name,« said Jehovah.

13. »Behold, the days are coming,« said Jehovah, »that the plowman will overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes by the one who sows seed. The mountains will drop sweet wine, and all the hills will melt.

14. »I will bring my people Israel back from captivity. They will rebuild the cities and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards, and drink the wine. They will also make gardens and eat their fruit.

15. »I will plant them upon their own land and they will no more be plucked up out of their land that I have given them.« Jehovah your God has spoken.
