## Daniel 1

__(Writer: Daniel) (Hebrew: Da-ni-yel means »My Judge is God« ) (536 B.C.E.) (Babylon)__

1. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Judah. It was in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah.

2. Jehovah allowed Nebuchadnezzar to capture Jehoiakim king of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar carried part of the vessels of the house of God into the Plain of Shinar in Babylon. He brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.

3. The king ordered Ashpenaz the chief of his officials to bring in some of the Israelites including some of the royal family and nobles.

4. These were young people who had no defects. They were good looking and intelligent, with knowledge. They showed wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of science. They had ability to serve in the king's court and were taught the language and literature of the Chaldeans.

5. The king assigned a daily amount of the king's special rich food for them and also the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years. At the end of that time they would serve the king.

6. Now among these children of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.

7. The officer in charge gave names to them: To Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar. Hananiah was called Shadrach. Mishael was called Meshach and Azariah was named Abednego.

8. Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's special food and wine. He requested permission from the officer in charge that he might not defile himself.

9. God caused the officer in charge to show special favor and kindness to Daniel.

10. The officer in charge said to Daniel: »I fear my lord the king. He has appointed your food and your drink. Why should he see your faces worse looking than other young people your age? Would you endanger my head with the king?«

11. Daniel answered the officer appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:

12. »Test your servants, please, for ten days. Give them vegetables to eat and water to drink.

13. »You compare our appearance and the appearance of the young people who eat the kings special food. Then you deal with us according to what you see.«

14. So he listened to them and allowed them to prove the matter for ten days.

15. They looked better when the ten days ended! They were fairer in appearance and fatter in flesh than the young people who ate the kings special food.

16. So the steward took away their special food and wine and gave them vegetables and water.

17. God gave these young people knowledge, understanding, and wisdom of all types of literature and learning. Daniel had understanding and wisdom in all visions and dreams.

18. When the appointed time for learning ended the chief officer brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.

19. The king interviewed them and found out that none was found to be like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they served the king.

20. The king found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire realm. This was in every matter of wisdom and understanding.

21. Daniel continued to the first year of king Cyrus.

## Daniel 2

1. It was the second year of his reign. He was troubled and could not sleep. Nebuchadnezzar had dreams and was disturbed by them.

2. The king summoned the magicians, enchanters conjurers, sorcerers, and the Chaldeans and commanded them to tell the king about his dreams. They came in and stood before the king.

3. The king said: »I had a dream that troubles me and I want to understand what the dream means.«

4. The Chaldeans spoke in the Syrian language: »O king, may you live for a very long time. Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.«

5. The king answered: »I have decided. If you do not make the dream known to me and its interpretation you will be cut in pieces, and your houses will be made a dunghill foul smelling pile of rubbish.

6. »But if you tell me the dream and what it means you will receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore tell me the dream and the interpretation of it.«

7. They answered the second time. They said: »Let the king tell his servants the dream. Then we will tell the interpretation.«

8. The king responded: »I am certain that you bargain for time, because you see my command is firm.

9. »If you do not tell me my dream, the law will apply to you. You are stalling by speaking lies to me until I change my requirements. Tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me the interpretation of it.«

10. The Chaldeans answered: »There is no man on earth who can do what the king requires. No king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.

11. »It is a rare thing that the king requires. There is no other person who can show it to the king, except the gods, and they do not live with humans.«

12. This caused the king to be angry. In fact he became furious! He commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.

13. So the decree was delivered. The wise men were to be executed. They searched for Daniel and his companions to execute them.

14. Daniel sent an answer tempered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon.

15. He asked Arioch the king's captain: »Why is the decree so urgent from the king?« Then Arioch explained it to Daniel.

16. Daniel made an appointment with the king so he could show the king the interpretation.

17. Then Daniel went back to his house, and explained everything to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

18. that they would request mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret. And they would request that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

19. The secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Daniel praised the God of heaven.

20. Daniel said: »Praise be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are his.

21. »He changes the times and the seasons. He removes kings, and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to the discerning.

22. »He reveals the deep and hidden things. He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.

23. »I thank you, and praise you, O God of my fathers. You have given me wisdom and might. You have made known to me what we desired from you. For you have made known to us the king's situation.«

24. Therefore Daniel went to Arioch. Arioch was appointed by the king to destroy the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him: »Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king and I will show the king the interpretation.«

25. Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said: »I have found a man of the captive children of Judah who will make the interpretation known to the king.«

26. The king said to Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar: »Are you able to tell me about my dream and interpret it?«

27. Daniel answered: »Wise men, enchanters, magicians, and soothsayers cannot show the secret the king demanded.

28. »There is a God in heaven that reveals secrets. He made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what will be in days to come. Your dream and visions are these:

29. »As for you, O king, your thoughts while you were in bed were about what will happen in the future. He who reveals secrets revealed the future to you.

30. »Concerning me, this secret is not revealed to me to give me more wisdom than anyone else. It is for the purpose that the interpretation may be made known to the king; that you may know the thoughts of your mind.

31. »You, O king, saw a large statue. This statue was in fact very large. It was very bright as it stood before you. Its appearance was awesome.

32. »The statue had a head of pure gold, chest and arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass.

33. »It had legs of iron and its feet were partly of iron, and partly of clay.

34. »You watched while a stone was cut out without hands. It struck the statue upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.

35. »The iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broke in pieces together. It became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors. The wind carried them away and no place was found for them. The stone that struck the statue became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

36. »This was the dream! We will interpret it for the king.

37. »You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory.

38. »He gave the children of men, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens to your hand. He made you the ruler over them all! You are the head of gold.

39. »After you another inferior kingdom will arise and another third kingdom of brass, which will rule over all the earth.

40. »The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, since iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things. It is iron that crushes all these. It will break in pieces and crush.

41. »The feet and toes you saw, part of potters' clay, and part of iron will be a divided kingdom. It will have the strength of iron. However, you saw the iron mixed with clay.

42. »As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong, and partly broken.

43. »The iron mixed with clay will mingle with the seed of men. But they will not adhere to one another. For iron does not stick to clay.

44. »In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. Its sovereignty will not be entrusted to another people. It will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it will stand forever!

45. »You saw a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. It broke the iron, brass, clay, silver, and the gold to pieces. The great God made known to the king what will happen in the future. The dream is certain, and the interpretation of it is sure.«

46. King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel. He commanded that they present an offering and burn incense to him.

47. The king spoke to Daniel: »It is true, your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you were able to reveal this secret.«

48. The king made Daniel great! He gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon. He was appointed chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.

49. Daniel requested that the king appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon. Daniel sat in the court of the king.

__THE BLAZING FURNACE__

1. Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold. He set it up in the plain of Dura, the province of Babylon. It was ninety feet tall and nine feet wide.

2. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king gathered the satraps, deputies, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces. They came to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.

3. The satraps, deputies, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together at the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up. They stood before the image.

4. Then the herald proclaimed: »You are commanded to do this, O peoples, nations, and men of every language.

5. »When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.

6. »Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace.«

7. When all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.

8. Some Chaldean Astrologers brought accusation against the Jews.

9. They said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, »O king, may you live for a very long time.

10. »You, O king, made a decree, that every man that hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.

11. »Whoever does not fall down and worship, will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace.

12. »The Jews whom you appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego have not listened to you. They do not serve your gods. They do not worship the golden image that you set up.«

13. Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. They brought these men before the king.

14. Nebuchadnezzar said to them: »Is it true Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my god, nor worship the golden image that I set up?

15. »Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, good! But if you do not worship it you will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace that same hour. What god will be able to rescue you from my hand?«

16. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king: »O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.

17. »If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace. He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.

18. »If not you should know O king that we will not serve your gods. We will not worship the golden image that you set up!«

19. Nebuchadnezzar was furious. The expression on his face changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than its required heat.

20. He commanded the mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw them into the blazing furnace.

21. Then these men were bound in their coats, caps and their other garments. They were thrown into the midst of the blazing furnace.

22. Because of the urgency of the king's commandment and the exceeding hot furnace, the flame of the fire killed the men who delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

23. These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the blazing furnace.

24. Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished. He hurried to speak to his counselors: / »Did we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?« They answered: »True O king.«

25. He said: »Look, I see four men walking in the midst of the fire. They are not hurt! The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!«

26. Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning blazing furnace. He called out: »Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God come here!« Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.

27. The satraps, deputies, governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men. They saw that the fire had no power upon their bodies. Not a single hair on their head was singed. Neither were their clothes changed and they did not smell like fire.

28. Nebuchadnezzar said: »Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They violated the king's command and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

29. »Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut into pieces. Their houses shall be made a dunghill. There is no other god that is able to deliver like this.«

30. The king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

__KING DREAMS ABOUT TREE__

1. »Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.

2. »It seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.

3. »How great are his signs! How mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.

4. »I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and active in my palace.

5. »I saw a dream that made me afraid. When I saw this vision my thoughts troubled me.

6. »I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon that they might explain the dream to me.

7. »The magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came to me. I told the dream to them. They did not explain the dream to me.

8. »Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, finally came to me. He has the spirit of the holy gods. So I told the dream to him saying:

9. »O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret troubles you! Tell me the visions I have seen in my dream. Give me the interpretation.

10. »Here are the visions of my head: I saw a tree in the midst of the earth. It was very tall.

11. »The tree grew and became strong. Its height reached to heaven. It could be seen from distant parts of the earth.

12. »The leaves were beautiful and the fruit abundant. In it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shadow under it. The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches. All flesh was fed by it.

13. »I saw in the visions of my head: Behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.

14. »He cried aloud: Chop down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.

15. »Leave the stump and roots in the earth. Apply to it a band of iron and copper in the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of heaven. Let its portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.

16. »Let its heart be changed from a man's, and let a beast's heart be given to it. Seven times should pass over it.

17. »The decision is by the decree of the watchers. The sentence by the word of the holy ones! It is to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets over it the lowest of men.«

18. »I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream and you O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation! For all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make the interpretation known to me. You are able for the spirit of the holy gods is in you!

19. »Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king said, Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or the interpretation trouble you. Belteshazzar answered: My lord, the dream may be to them that hate you and the interpretation to your adversaries.

__DANIEL INTERPRETS__

20. »The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and was seen in the distant parts of the earth;

21. whose leaves were beautiful and fruit abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens lived:

22. It is you O king! You have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven. Your dominion is to the end of the earth.

23. »Since the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven saying: Chop down the tree, and destroy it. Leave the stump and the roots in the earth. With a band of iron and brass leave it in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven. Let its portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over it.«

24. This is the interpretation, O king. It is the decree from the Most High that has come to my lord the king.

25. You will be driven from men. Your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field. You will eat grass like oxen and will be wet with the dew of heaven. Seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.

26. »Because they commanded to leave the stump and the roots of the tree your kingdom will be sure to you. After that you will know that the heavens do rule.

27. »Let my counsel be acceptable to you O King. Stop your sins by being righteous and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. May there be a lengthening of your prosperity.«

28. All this happened to king Nebuchadnezzar.

29. At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.

30. The king spoke: »Is this not great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?«

31. While the word was in the king's mouth a voice came from heaven, saying: »O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from you.

32. »You will be driven from men. Your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You will have to eat grass like bulls. Seven times shall pass over you until you know the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.«

33. That same hour it was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from men and did eat grass like bulls. His body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair grew like eagles' feathers, and his fingernails like birds' claws.

34. »At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven and my understanding returned to me. I blessed the Most High and I praised and honored the one who lives forever. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.

35. All the inhabitants of the earth are considered as nothing. He does according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth. None can stop him, or say to him: What do you do?

36. »My understanding returned to me at that time. The glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me. My counselors and my lords came to me. I was established in my kingdom with excellent greatness.

37. »Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, extol and honor the King of heaven. All his works are truth, and his ways justice. He is able to abase humblesubdue those who walk in pride.«

## Daniel 5

__HANDWRITING ON WALL__

1. King Belshazzar held a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine with them.

2. While he tasted the wine, Belshazzar commanded to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the Temple in Jerusalem. This way the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them.

3. Then they brought the gold vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the House of God that was at Jerusalem. The king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.

4. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, silver, copper, iron, wood, and of stone.

5. In the same hour the fingers of a man's hand appeared, and wrote above the lamp stand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace. The king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

6. Then the king's countenance appearance changed in him. His thoughts troubled him. The joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees struck one against the other.

7. The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. / The king spoke to the wise men of Babylon: »Whoever reads this writing, and shows me the interpretation of it will be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck. He will be the third ruler in the kingdom«.

8. All the kings wise men came. But they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.

9. King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his appearance changed. His lords were perplexed.

10. The queen came into the banquet hall. She said: »O king, may you live for a very long time: do not let your thoughts trouble you or change your countenance.

11. »There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods. In your fathers day, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers.

12. »Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, has an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding for interpreting dreams, showing of dark sentences, and dissolving doubts. Let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.«

13. Daniel was brought before the king. The king spoke to Daniel: »Are you that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?

14. »I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.

15. »The wise men and the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing, and make known the interpretation of it. But they could not show the interpretation.

16. »I have heard that you can give interpretations and dissolve doubts. If you can read the writing and make the interpretation known to me you will be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and will be the third ruler in the kingdom.«

17. Daniel answered the king: »Keep your gifts and give your rewards to another. I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.

18. »O you king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty.

19. »Because of the greatness he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he chose he killed and whom he chose he kept alive. Whom he chose he raised up, and whom he chose he put down.

20. »But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened with pride he dealt proudly. He was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him:

21. »He was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts. His dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.

22. »You his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you know all this.

23. »You lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven. They have brought the vessels of his house before you and your lords, wives and concubines. They drank wine from them. You praise the gods of silver and gold, of copper, iron, wood, and stone, which you do not see, nor hear, nor know. You have not glorified the God whose hand holds your breath and life.

24. »Then the part of the hand was sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.

25. »This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN.

26. »This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom, and brought it to an end;

27. »TEKEL: you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.

28. »PERES; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.«

29. Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

30. In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.

31. Darius the Mede received the kingdom. He was sixty-two years old.

__DANIEL IN THE LIONS DEN__

1. It pleased Darius to appoint a hundred and twenty governors over the kingdom. They were to be located throughout the whole kingdom.

2. Three commissioners were placed over them. Daniel was one of the commissioners. These governors were to give account to them so that the king would not suffer loss.

3. Daniel was distinguished above the other commissioners and the governors because an excellent spirit mind was in him. Therefore the king thought to set him over the whole realm.

4. Then the commissioners and the governors sought to find a charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom. They could find no charge, nor error, nor fault, for he was faithful.

5. These men said: »We shall not find any charge against Daniel, unless we find it against him in the Law of his God.«

6. Then these commissioners and governors assembled before the king, and said: »King Darius, may you live for a very long time.«

7. »All the governors of the kingdom, the deputies and the governors, the counselors consulted together to establish a royal statute. They made a strong decree, that whoever prays to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions.

8. »Now, O king, establish the decree by signing the document. That it will not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be altered.

9. King Darius signed the document for the decree.«

10. Daniel knew that the decree was signed. He went into his house. His windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem. He kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, like he did before.

11. These men assembled together. They found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.

12. They approached the king about his decree: »Did you sign a decree stating that every man that shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions?« The king answered: »The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be altered.«

13. Then they said: »Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, does not show you respect, O king, nor the decree that you signed. He offers his prayer three times a day.«

14. Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased with himself. He was determined that Daniel not be delivered to him; and he labored all day to rescue him.

15. Then these men assembled before the king and said: »Know, O king that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree or statute that the king establishes may be changed.«

16. Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and threw him into the den of lions. The king spoke to Daniel: »Your God whom you serve will deliver you.«

17. A stone was placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.

18. The king went to his palace and did not eat. He refused musical entertainment and he could not sleep.

19. He arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.

20. He came near to the den and cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel: »O Daniel, servant of the living God, did the God you serve deliver you from the lion?«

21. Daniel said to the king: »O king, may you live for a very long time.«

22. « My God sent his angel, and shut the lions' mouths. They did not hurt me. I was found innocent before him. I have done no wrong before you, O king.«

23. The king was very happy. He commanded that they take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on him, because he trusted in his God.

24. The king commanded that the men that accused Daniel and had him thrown into the den of lions be thrown into the den of lions. They cast them into the den of lions, their children, and their wives; and the lions killed them and broke their bones in pieces before they reached the bottom of the den.

25. Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: »Peace is multiplied to you.

26. »I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble with respect before the God of Daniel. He is the living God, and steadfast forever! His kingdom will not be destroyed. His dominion will be even unto the end.

27. »He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, which has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.«

28. So Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

## Daniel 7

__VISION OF FOUR BEASTS__

1. Daniel had a dream and visions. He wrote the summery of the dream that came to his mind while he was in bed. It was the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon.

2. Daniel said: »I saw in my vision by night, the four winds of heaven blew upon the great sea.

3. »Four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.

4. »The first was like a LION. It had eagle's wings. I watched till the wings were pulled off. It was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon two feet like a man. A man's heart and mind was given to it.

5. »Look, a second beast, like a BEAR. It was raised up on one side. Three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said to it, Arise and devour much flesh.

6. »I saw another beast. It was like a LEOPARD. It had four wings as a bird on its back. The beast also had four heads. Dominion ruling authority was given to it.

7. »After this I saw more visions in the night. I saw a FOURTH BEAST terrible and powerful, and exceedingly strong! It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from the beasts that came before it. It had ten horns!

8. »I looked at the horns and another one, a little horn came. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man. It had a mouth that spoke great domineeringboastful things. The three first horns were plucked up roots and all.

9. »I watched as thrones were placed. The ANCIENT OF DAYS sat on one throne. His clothing was white as snow. His hair was like pure wool. His throne was like fiery flames, and the wheels on it were like burning fire.

10. »A fiery stream issued from before him. Thousands of thousands ministered to him. Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The judgment was set and the books were opened.

11. »I paid attention because of the sound of the great boastful words the horn spoke. I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed. It was burned with fire.

12. »The dominion authority was taken away from the other beasts. Yet their lives were prolonged for a season.

13. »I saw in the night-visions someone like a SON OF MAN came with the clouds of heaven. He came to the Ancient of Days. They brought him near before him.

14. »He was given legal power and a kingdom. Out of his glory all the peoples, nations, and languages will serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away. His kingdom will not be destroyed. (Revelation 11:15) (Daniel 2:44) (Psalm 45:6)

15. »I, Daniel, was grieved to the center of my being, and the visions in my head troubled me.

16. I came near to one of them that stood nearby, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me. HE MADE ME KNOW THE INTERPRETATION OF EVERYTHING.

17. »These FOUR GREAT BEASTS, ARE FOUR KINGS, that arise out of the earth.

18. »The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom. They will possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.

19. »I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast that was different from the others. This beast was exceeding terrible. It had teeth made of iron. Its claws were made of copper. It devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet.

20. »There were ten horns on its head. Three horns fell and another horn came up. The horn that had eyes and a mouth spoke great domineeringboastful things. Its appearance was greater than the others.

21. »I watched that same horn as it made war with the holy ones. It prevailed against defeated them.

22. »Then the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High, and the time came that the holy ones possessed the kingdom. (Revelation 5:10; Revelation 20:4; Revelation 20:6)

23. »He said: The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth. It will be different from all other kingdoms. It will devour the entire earth. It will trample it down and break it in pieces.

24. »The ten horns are ten kings that will arise out of this kingdom! Another will arise after them. He will be different from the former, and he will subdue three kings.

25. »He will speak words against the Most High Supreme God and wear down afflictcause great distress the holy ones of the Most High. He will think to change the times and law and will have control until a time and times and half a time. Three and one-half years

26. »But the judgment shall be set applied and they will take away his power forever.

27. »The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people who are the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom! All dominions legal authorities will serve and obey him.

28. »This is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were very troubled. My appearance was changed. I kept the matter in my heart.«

## Daniel 8

1. A vision appeared to me, Daniel, in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar. It appeared after the first vision.

2. I saw in the vision: I was in Shushan the castle palace, which is in the province of Elam by the River Ulai.

3. A ram with two horns stood next to the river. The two horns were tall, but one was taller than the other, and the taller one came up last.

4. I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward. No beasts could stand before him. Neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand. He did what ever he wanted and boasted about himself.

5. As I observed a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth. It did not touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

6. He approached the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing next to the river. He charged him with the full fury of his power.

7. I saw him come close to the ram. He was driven with anger and he struck the ram and broke his two horns. The ram had no power to stand before him. He threw him down to the ground, and trampled upon him. No one could deliver the ram out of his hand.

8. The he-goat promoted boasted about himself exceedingly. He was strong. The great horn was broken and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.

9. A little horn cam out of one of them. The little horn became very great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.

10. It grew great, even to the host of heaven. It threw down to the ground some of the host and it trampled them.

11. It magnified itself, even to the prince of the host. It took the continual burnt offering from him and the place of his sanctuary was thrown down.

12. The host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression. It cast down truth to the ground, and whatever it wanted to do and prospered.

13. Then I heard a holy one speak and another holy one said to it: »How long will the vision be concerning the continual burnt-offering and the transgression that makes desolate to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?«

14. He said to me: »Two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.«

15. After I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision I sought to understand it. Behold, there appeared before me a man standing.

16. I heard a man's voice from the banks of the Ulai River. He called to Gabriel: »Make this man understand the vision of the time of the end.«

17. He came near where I stood. I was afraid and fell to my face. But he said to me: »Understand, O son of man the vision belongs to the time of the end.«

__WORLD POWERS NAMED__

18. He spoke to me while I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground. He touched me, and set me upright.

19. He said: I will make you know what will happen in the final time of indignation for the vision is for the appointed time of the end.

20. »The ram that you saw that had the two horns symbolizes represents the kings of MEDIA and PERSIA.

21. »And the rough he-goat is the king of GREECE. The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.

22. »As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.

23. »Toward the end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their fullness, a FIERCE KING will arise who will understand sinister schemes.

24. »He will be mighty, but not by his own power. He will destroy excessively cause great devistation and will prosper and do anything he wants to do. He will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.

25. »Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He will boast about himself in his heart. In their security they will destroy many. He will even stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be destroyed without human power.

26. »The vision told about the evenings and mornings is true: but seal up the vision. It belongs to the future.«

27. I, Daniel, fainted from exhaustion, and was sick for days. Then I rose up, and did the king's business. I wondered about the vision, but none understood it.

## Daniel 9

1. In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus Xerxes, of the lineage of the Medes. He was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans.

2. It was the first year of his reign. I, Daniel, understood from The Books Holy Scriptures the number of the years in the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet. It was seventy years since the destruction of Jerusalem.

3. I looked to Jehovah God to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.

4. And I prayed to Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, »Oh, Jehovah, the great and fear-inspiring awesome God, who keeps his covenant and loving kindness for those who love him and keep his commandments.

5. »We have sinned. We have dealt perversely. We have acted wickedly and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances.

6. »We have not listened to your servants the prophets who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

7. »O Jehovah, righteousness belongs to you! Shame belongs to us this day! To the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.

8. »O Jehovah, to us belongs shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.

9. »To Jehovah our God belong mercies and forgiveness. We have rebelled against him.

10. »We have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.

11. »Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law and turned aside, that they should not obey your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out upon us. It is the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God. We have sinned against you.

12. »He confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who ruled us. He brought a great evil on us. Nothing under heaven has been done like what was done to Jerusalem.

13. »As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us. Yet we have not earnestly requested the favor of Jehovah our God. We should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in your truth.

14. »Therefore Jehovah watched over the evil and brought it upon us. Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works. We have not obeyed his voice.

15. »And now, O Jehovah our God, you brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made a name for yourself that day. We have sinned! We have done wickedly.

16. »O Jehovah, according to all your righteousness, let your anger, I pray you, be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. Because of our sins, and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all those who are round about us.

17. »Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplications, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for Jehovahs sake.

18. »O my God, incline your ear, and hear! Open your eyes, and behold our desolations and the city that is called by your name. We do not present our supplications before you because of our righteous merits, but according to your many mercies.

19. »O Jehovah, hear; O Jehovah, forgive; O Jehovah, pay attention and act! Do not delay for your own sake, O my God! Because your city and your people are called by your name.«

20. While I was speaking, in prayer, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;

21. While I was speaking in prayer, the spirit person who looked like a man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, was inspired to come quickly and touch me. It was about the time of the evening offering.

22. He instructed me: »O Daniel,« he said, »I have now come to give you wisdom insight and understanding.

23. »At the beginning of your supplications the commandment went forth. I came to report to you for you are greatly loved. Consider the matter, and understand the vision.

__PROPHETIC WEEKS UNTIL MESSIAH__

24. »Seventy weeks seventy sets of seven time periods are decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish transgression and to make an end of sin, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.

25. »Know and discern, that from the utterance of the commandment to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One Messiah, the Leader: there shall be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again with a public square and moat, even in terrible times.

26. »And after the sixty-two weeks the anointed one will be cut off destroyedkilled and shall have nothing. The people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be by the flood of war and desolations.

27. »He will make a firm covenant with many for one week time period of seven. In the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the offerings to cease. The one that makes desolate will come upon the wing of abominations. At the end that which is decreed will be poured out upon the one lying desolate.«

## Daniel 10

1. In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a matter was revealed to Daniel. Daniels name was also Belteshazzar. The matter was true. There was a great military movement. He understood the matter. He also understood the vision.

2. In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.

3. I ate no pleasant bread; neither flesh nor wine entered my mouth. I did not anoint myself at all until three whole weeks were completed.

4. I was on the shore of the great river, Hiddekel Tigris River on the twenty-fourth day of the first month.

5. I looked up to see a man clothed in linen. His loins were girded with pure gold of the Uphaz region.

6. His body also was like chrysolite and his face as the appearance of lightning. His eyes were like flaming torches and his arms and his feet like burnished copper. The sound of his words was like the sound of a crowd.

7. I, Daniel, saw the vision alone, for the men that were with me did not see the vision. A great quaking fell upon them and they ran away to hide.

8. I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. My appearance turned deathlike pallorlividpale and I had no strength.

9. Yet I heard the sound of his words. When I heard the sound of his words I fell with my face toward the ground into a deep sleep.

10. A hand touched me and set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.

11. He said to me: »O Daniel, you are greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you. Stand upright for I have been sent to you.« When he spoke these words I stood trembling.

12. Then he said: »Do not fear Daniel! From the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come in response to your prayer.

13. »The prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me twenty-one days but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

14. »Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the future for the vision is yet for many days.«

15. When he spoke these words to me I looked to the ground and was unable to speak.

16. Then one who looked like a human touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke to him: »O my lord, by reason of the vision I have convulsions and I have no strength.

17. »For how can the servant of my lord talk? I had no strength in me. I was also without breath.«

18. Then the one with the human appearance touched me and he strengthened me.

19. He said, »O man greatly beloved, do not fear, peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong.« And when he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, »Let my lord speak for you have strengthened me.«

20. Then he said: »Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. The prince of Greece will also come.

21. »But I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. There is no one standing firmly with me against these, but Michael your prince.«

## Daniel 11

1. »I stood up to confirm and strengthen Darius the Mede in his first year.

2. »Now I will tell you the truth. Look, there will be three more kings in Persia. Then the fourth will be richer than the others. When he is strong because of his riches he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.

3. »A mighty king will stand up and rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.

4. »After he appears his kingdom will be broken. It will be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion as he ruled. His kingdom will be plucked up, even for others besides these.

5. »The king of the south will be strong along with one of his princes. His prince will be stronger than him, and have dominion. His dominion will be a great dominion.

6. »At the end of years they will become allies form an allience. The daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she will not retain the strength of her arm power; neither will he stand, nor his arm power; but she will be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.

7. »But out of a shoot from her roots will one stand up in his place. He will come with the army and enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will fight against them, and will prevail.

8. He will carry captive into Egypt their gods, with their molten images, and with their valuable vessels of silver and of gold. He will stand off some years from the king of the north.

9. »The king of the north will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land.

10. »And his sons will be warlike and will assemble a multitude of great forces, which will come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they will return and fight, even to his fortress.

11. »And the king of the south will be moved with anger, and will come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north. He will assemble a large army, and the army will be defeated.

12. »The army will be lifted up, and his heart will be filled with pride. He will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not prevail.

13. »The king of the north will return, and will set forth an army greater than the former. He will come on at the end of the times with a great army that is well supplied with much equipment.

14. »In those times there will many who stand up against the king of the south. Also the children of the violent among your people will rebel up to establish the vision, but they will fall.

15. »So the king of the north will come, and cast up a siege ramp, and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the south will not stand, neither his chosen people, neither will there be any strength to stand.

16. »But he that comes against him will do according to his own will, and none will stand against him. He will stand in the glorious land, and in his hand will be destruction.

17. »And he will be determined to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions. He will perform them. He will give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she will not stand or be on his side.

18. »He will turn back to the coastlands and will capture many. However, a prince will cause the reproach offered by him to cease. He will cause his reproach to turn upon him.

19. »Then he will turn his attention toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and will not be found.

20. »Then one will stand up in his place who will send an oppressor tax collecter to pass through the glory of the kingdom. However, he will be destroyed within a few days, neither in anger, nor in battle.

21. »A contemptible person will stand in his place. He will be one whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom. He will come in time of security, and will obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

22. »The overwhelming forces will be overwhelmed from before him, and will be broken after the prince of the covenant is destroyed.

23. »And after the alliance made with him he will work deceitfully. He will come up, and will become strong, with a small nation of people.

24. »In time of security he will come even upon the richest places of the province. He will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers. He will scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance. He will devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.

25. »He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army. The king of the south will war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army, but he will not stand. This is because they will devise schemes against him.

26. »Those who eat of his rich foods will destroy him. His army will overflow and many will fall down slain.

27. »And as for both these kings, their hearts will be inclined to do bad things. They will speak lies at one table and nothing will succeed. The end will come at the time appointed.

28. »Then king of the north will return to his land with great wealth. His heart will be against the holy covenant. He will do what he pleases and return to his own land.

29. »At the time appointed he will invade the south again. But the outcome will not be the same as it was at the earlier time.

30. »For ships of Kittim will come against him. He will be grieved and will return. He will have indignation against the holy covenant and will do what he pleases. He will even return, and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.

31. »His armed forces will stand with him, and they will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take away the continual burnt offering. They will set up the abomination that makes desolate.

32. »Those who act wickedly against the covenant will be perverted by flatteries. However, the people who know their God will be strong and act effectively.

33. »Those who are wise among the people will instruct many. Yet they will fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, for many days.

34. »When they fall, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join them in their flatteries.

35. »Some of them who are wise have insight will fall. This will refine them, and purify them, and make them clean, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for the time appointed.

36. »The king will do according to his will. He will exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god. He will speak horrable atrocious things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the indignation is accomplished for that which is determined will be done.

37. »Neither will he honor the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god for he will magnify himself above them all.

38. »He will honor the god of military fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know. He will honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and expensive gifts.

39. »He will deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. Whoever acknowledges him will increase with glory. He will make them rulers over many, and will divide the land for a price.

40. »The king of the south will contend with him at the time of the end. The king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with a large fleet of ships. He will enter into the countries and overflow and pass through them.

41. »He will also invade the glorious land, and many countries will be overthrown. These will be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

42. »He will stretch forth his power and authority over many countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.

43. »He will exercise power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. The Libyans and the Ethiopians will be under his control.

44. »News from the east and the north will trouble him. He will go forth with great fury to destroy and annihilate many.

45. »He will plant the tents of his palace dwell in and control between the sea and the glorious holy mountain. But he will come to his end, and none will help him.

## Daniel 12

1. »At that time Michael will stand up. He is the great prince who stands for the children of your people. There will be a time of trouble that has not happened since the beginning of nations. Then your people will be delivered, every one whos name is found written in the book.

2. »Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.

3. »Those who have wisdom insight will shine like the brightness of the firmament. They turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.

4. »But you, O Daniel, keep the words secret, and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will run back and forth and knowledge will increase.«

5. Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood two others, one on the bank of the river on this side, and the other on the bank of the river on that side.

6. One said to the man clothed in linen, which was above the waters of the river: »How long will it be to the end of these wonders?«

7. I heard the man clothed in linen, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives forever: »It will be for three and one half years; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things will be finished.«

8. I heard but I did not understand. I said: »O my lord, how will this all end?«

9. He replied: »Go your way, Daniel for the words are kept secret and sealed till the time of the end.

10. »Many will purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined. The wicked will do wickedly and none of the wicked will understand. Those who are wise will understand!

11. »From the time that the continual burnt offering will be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there will be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days.

12. »Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty five days.

13. »Go toward the end, for you will enter into rest. Then you will rise for your determined condition in life at the end of the days.«
