## Luke 1

__(Writer: Luke, a physician and faithful companion of the Apostle Paul) (56-58 C.E.) (Caesarea)__

1. Many have attempted to write an orderly narrative about the things that have taken place.

2. They received testimony from those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning. Ministers of Gods word delivered it to us.

3. Most excellent Theophilus Greek: Theo philos: friend of God: I have accurately traced the course of all things from the beginning. Now it seems good to me to write this report to you.

4. In this way you will know with certainty the truth that you were taught.

5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a priest named Zechariah. He was of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth.

6. They were both righteous before God. They blamelessly obeyed all the commandments and ordinances of God Greek: kurios: God.

7. They had no child for Elizabeth was barren and they both were well advanced in years.

8. He faithfully executed the priests duties before God.

9. The custom was to draw lots to see who served in the temple. It was his turn to enter into the temple of God and burn incense.

10. The whole crowd of people prayed outside at the hour of incense.

11. Gods angel appeared to him when he was standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

12. Zechariah was troubled. When he saw the angel he was filled with fear.

13. »Have no fear Zechariah,« said the angel, »for God has heard your prayer. Your wife Elisabeth will have a son and his name will be John.

14. »You will be filled with joy, and many will be happy at his birth.

15. »He will be great in the eyes of God. He will not drink wine or strong drink and he will be full of Holy Spirit from the time of his birth.

16. »Great numbers of the children of Israel will return to Jehovah their God because of him. (1 Samuel 7:3)

17. »He will go before God in the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness. This will make ready a people whose hearts have been directed to Jehovah.« (Malachi 3:1)

18. Zechariah asked: »How might I be certain of this for my wife and I are old?«

19. The angel answered: »I am Gabriel, whose place is before God. I have been sent to give you this good news.

20. »You will be without voice or language till the day when these things happen. Your lack of faith in what I say has caused this.«

21. The people were waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised he was in the Temple for such a long time.

22. When he came out he could not speak to them. They realized he saw a vision in the temple. Instead of talking he made signs to them.

23. When the days of his priestly service ended he went home.

24. His wife Elisabeth became pregnant. She remained in seclusion for five months.

25. She said: »This is the way God has dealt with me by taking away my reproach among men.« (1 Samuel 1:11)

26. The next month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee

27. to a virgin named Mary. Mary was engaged to Joseph, a descendant of King David.

28. Gabriel appeared to her and said: »Greetings highly favored one. God is with you.«

29. She was greatly troubled by this and wondered about the meaning of this salutation.

30. The angel said to Mary: »Do not fear for you have found favor with God.

31. »You will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son. You will call his name Jesus.

32. »He will be great. He will be called the Son of the Most High. Jehovah God will give him the throne of his father David. (Isaiah 11:1-10)

33. »He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will not end.«

34. Mary asked the angel: »How is this to be for I have had no intercourse with a man?«

35. The angel replied: »Holy Spirit would come to you and the power of the Most High will envelope you. Because of this the newborn will be called the Son of God.«

36. »Your relative Elisabeth has also conceived a son even in her old age. This so-called barren woman is in her sixth month.

37. »When God speaks, these things are possible.«

38. Mary said: »Look, Jehovahs servant. Let it happen to me as you spoke.« The angel departed from her. (1 Samuel 1:11)

39. Mary traveled with haste to the city of Judah in the hill country.

40. She entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elisabeth.

41. When Elisabeth heard the greeting from Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. Elisabeth was filled with Holy Spirit.

42. She shouted loudly: »Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!«

43. »How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. »When I heard your greeting the baby leaped in my womb for joy.

45. »Blessed is she that believes. That which God spoke will be fulfilled.«

46. Mary said: »My life magnifies Jehovah my God. (1 Samuel 2:1)

47. »My heart and mind rejoice in God my Savior.

48. »He has looked on the low position of his servant. All generations from now on will call me blessed.

49. »He that is mighty has done great things to me. Holy is his name.

50. »His mercy is to all generations for all who respect him.

51. »He shows strength with his arm. He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their heart.

52. »He removes rulers from their thrones and exalts the humble.

53. »He fills the hungry with good things and sends the rich away empty handed.

54. »He has helped Israel his servant that he might remember mercy.

55. »He spoke to our fathers. To Abraham and his seed forever.«

56. Mary stayed with Elisabeth about three months, and returned to her house.

57. Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth. She gave birth to a son.

58. Her neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.

59. On the eighth day they circumcised the child. They planned to call him Zechariah, after the name of the father.

60. His mother spoke up and said: »He shall be called John.«

61. They all said: »None of your relatives are called by this name.«

62. They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.

63. He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« They were all amazed.

64. Immediately his tongue loosed, his mouth opened and he spoke, blessing God.

65. Everyone nearby was in fear. These accounts spread abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.

66. All that heard them wondered in their heart, saying, »What will this child be? For the hand of Jehovah was with him.«

67. His father Zechariah was filled with Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,

68. »Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel. He has visited his people and brought them redemption. (Psalm 72:18)

69. »He raised up a horn of salvation power of deliverance for us in the house of his servant David

70. »He spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from ages past.

71. »He provided salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us.

72. »He shows mercy towards our fathers and remembers his holy covenant.

73. »It was the oath he spoke to Abraham our father.

74. »He gave us deliverance out of the hand of our enemies so we could serve him without fear.

75. »May we serve in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

76. »Your child will be called the prophet of the Most High. You will go in advance of Jehovah God to make his ways ready. (Malachi 3:1)

77. »To give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins.

78. »A rising of light will visit us from on high because of the tender mercy of our God.

79. »The light will shine on them who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. It will guide our feet into the way of peace.«

80. The child grew and became spiritually strong. He lived in the deserts till the time came to show himself to Israel.

## Luke 2

1. In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the inhabited earth.

2. This was the first census made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.

3. So every one went to his hometown to register.

4. Joseph came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to be counted and taxed. He went to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David.

5. He registered himself with Mary, who was engaged to him. She was about to become a mother.

6. While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth.

7. She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger. That was because there was no room for them in the inn.

8. Shepherds in the same country were in the field keeping watch by night over their flock.

9. Gods angel stood by them and His glory gave illumination around them and they were very afraid.

10. The angel spoke to them: »Do not be afraid. Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy to all the people.

11. »Christ Messiah the Lord, a Savior, is born this day in the city of David.

12. »This is the sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.«

13. Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God, and saying:

14. »Glory to God in the highest. Peace on earth among men with whom he is pleased.«

15. The angels went away from them into heaven. Then the shepherds said to one another, »Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which God told us about.«

16. They hurried to see the baby. They found Mary and Joseph. And they saw the baby lying in the manger.

17. As soon as they saw it they told what they had heard about the child.

18. All that heard it wondered at the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds.

19. Mary remembered all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.

20. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen.

21. After eight days the baby was circumcised. He was called by the name, Jesus. Jesus: Jehovah is salvation This was the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

22. Following the days of their purification according to the Law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem. There they would present him to Jehovah.

23. It is written in Gods law that every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to Jehovah. (Exodus 13:1, 2)

24. According to Gods Law they must offer a sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

25. There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for God to save Israel. Gods Holy Spirit was working in him.

26. Holy Spirit revealed to him that he would not die before he saw the Christ of Jehovah.

27. Under the power of the spirit he came to the temple. The parents brought in the child Jesus, that they obey the custom of the law.

28. He received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:

29. »Let your servant depart according to your word in peace.

30. »My eyes have seen your salvation.

31. »That which you prepared before the peoples.

32. »It is a light of revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel.«

33. Jesus father and mother were amazed at the things that were spoken concerning him.

34. Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother: »This child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign that is spoken against.

35. »A sword will pierce through your mind that the thoughts of many hearts will be disclosed.«

36. Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher was a very old prophetess.

37. She had been a widow eighty-four years. She never left the temple. She worshipped and fasted with supplications day and night.

38. Even up to that time she gave thanks to God and spoke to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.

39. When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of God they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

40. The child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom and was blessed by God.

41. Every year his parents went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.

42. When he was twelve years old they went to the feast of the Passover, as was their custom.

43. When the feast ended they started the return trip. Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not know this.

44. They thought he was in the traveling company. After a days journey they looked for him among their relatives and friends.

45. When they could not find him they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.

46. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers. He was listening and asking them questions.

47. All that heard him were amazed at his understanding.

48. When they saw him they were astonished. His mother said to him: »Son, why did you treat us this way? Your father and I have searched for you and we have been worried.«

49. He said: »Why did you look for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Fathers house?«

50. They did not understand what he said to them.

51. He went with them to Nazareth. He remained subject to them. His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

52. Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

## Luke 3

1. It was the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea. Herod served as tetrarch of Galilee. Herods brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis. Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene.

2. This was in the time when Annas and Caiaphas were chief priests. The word of God was delivered to John the son of Zechariah. He was in the wilderness.

3. John traveled in the region near the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

4. This was according to the words of Isaiah the prophet: »The voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make ready the way of Jehovah. Make his paths straight.

5. »Every valley shall be filled. Every mountain and hill shall be brought low. The crooked shall become straight and the rough ways smooth.

6. »All flesh shall see the salvation of God.« (Isaiah 40:3-6)

7. He told the crowds that came to be baptized by him: »You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. »Produce fruit that is worthy of repentance. Do not say we have Abraham for our father. I tell you, that God is able to make these stones into children for Abraham.

9. »The axe is now at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown in to the fire.«

10. The people asked him: »What must we do?«

11. He answered: »He who has two coats let him give to him who has none. He who has food let him do likewise.«

12. Tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him: »Teacher, what must we do?«

13. He told them: »Collect no more than that which is prescribed.«

14. Soldiers also asked him: »What must we do?« And he said: »Do not take money from any one by force. Never falsely accuse any one wrongfully and be content with your wages.«

15. Many people were expecting the Messiah. They reasoned in their hearts concerning John: »Perhaps he was the Messiah.«

16. John answered, saying to them: »I baptize you with water. He is coming who is mightier than I. I am not worthy to untie his shoelaces. He will baptize you in Holy Spirit and in fire.

17. »His winnowing fork is in his hand ready to thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor. He will gather the wheat into his barn. He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.«

18. He preached good news to the people by offering many encouraging words.

19. John reproved Herod the tetrarch for all the evil things he had done for he took his brother Herodias wife.

20. He added this also to them all. He locked up John in prison.

21. When all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. He prayed and heaven was opened.

22. Holy Spirit descended upon him in a bodily form like a dove. A voice came out of heaven. He said: »You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.«

## Luke 4

1. Jesus was full of Gods Holy Spirit when he returned from the Jordan. Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness.

2. He spent forty days in the wilderness being tempted by the devil. He did not eat anything during those days so when it was over he was hungry.

3. The devil said to him: »If you are the Son of God command this stone to become bread.«

4. Jesus answered him: »It is written, man shall not live by bread alone.« (Deuteronomy 8:3)

5. He led him up to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. Then the devil said: »I will give all this authority and glory to you, for it has been turned over to me. I may give it to whomever I will.

7. »If you will worship me it will all be yours.«

8. Jesus answered: »It is written, you shall worship Jehovah your God and him only shall you serve.« (Deuteronomy 6:13-15; Deuteronomy 10:12; Deuteronomy 10:20) (Exodus 20:3-5)

9. He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle highest level of the temple. Then he said to him: »If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here.

10. »It is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning you to guard you.

11. »They will carry you with their hands so you do not dash your foot against a stone.«

12. Jesus replied: »It is said you should not test Jehovah your God.« (Deuteronomy 6:16)

13. When the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him for a season.

14. Jesus was directed by Gods Spirit to return to Galilee. His reputation spread through out the region.

15. He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.

16. Then he returned to Nazareth the place where he was raised. He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day. This was his custom. There he stood up to read.

17. He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written:

18. »The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me. He anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind. To set at liberty those who are bruised.

19. »To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah.« (Isaiah 61:1)

20. He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.

21. »Today,« he said, »you heard this scripture fulfilled.«

22. All witnessed this and wondered at the kind words that he spoke. They said: »Is this not Josephs son?«

23. Then he said: »You will no doubt say this proverb to me, physician heal yourself. That which we heard was done at Capernaum do also here in your own country.«

24. He continued: »Truly I tell you no prophet is accepted welcomedhonored in his own country.

25. »I tell you truth. There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah. There was no rain from heaven three years and six months. There came a great famine over all the land.

26. »Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was only sent to Zarephath in the land of Sidon. She was a widow.

27. »There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet. Only one of them was cleansed, Naaman the Syrian.«

28. Everyone in the synagogue was angry when they heard these things.

29. They rose up to drive him out of the city. They led him to the top of the hill where their city was built to throw him down the hill.

30. But he passed through the midst of them and went his way.

31. Next he traveled to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. There he taught them on the Sabbath day.

32. They were astonished at his teaching for he spoke with authority.

33. A man in the synagogue had a spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out with a loud voice:

34. »What have we to do with you Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!«

35. Jesus rebuked him, saying: »Be quiet and come out of him.« When the demon had thrown him down in front of them, he came out of him without harming him.

36. All were amazed and spoke to one another. »What is he telling us? For he speaks with authority and with power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out.«

37. A rumor concerning him spread to every place of the region.

38. He left the synagogue and went to Simons house. Simons mother in law was suffering with a great fever. They asked him to help her.

39. He stood over her and rebuked the fever. It left her and immediately she rose up and ministered to them.

40. When the sun was setting they brought many who were sick of different diseases to him. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.

41. Demons came out from many. They cried out: »You are the Son of God!« He rebuked them and charged them not to speak for they knew he was the Christ.

42. The next day he went to a secluded place. The crowds followed him. They did not want him to leave them.

43. He said to them: »I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also. This is why I was sent.«

44. He preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. Jesus stood by the Lake of Gennesaret as the crowds pressed in upon him in order to hear the word of God.

2. He saw two boats docked by the shore. The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets.

3. He boarded one of the boats. It was Simons boat. He asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.

4. When he finished speaking he asked Simon to put into deep water and let down the nets for a catch.

5. Simon answered, Master we worked all night and caught nothing. At your word I will let down the nets.

6. When they did this they caught a large number of fish and their nets were breaking.

7. They called their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They filled both boats until they began to sink.

8. When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at Jesus knees. He said: »Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord.«

9. He and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish.

10. So were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon: »Do not fear. From now on you will catch men.«

11. After they brought their boats to land they left all and followed him.

12. One time while he was in one of the cities a man full of leprosy fell on his face before Jesus. He said: »Lord, if you want to you can make me clean.«

13. He stretched forth his hand and touched him, saying: »I want to, be made clean.« Immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. He told him to tell no one and go and show himself to the priest. Then he was to make a cleansing offering, just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

15. The news about him spread far away and large crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.

16. He withdrew to a quiet place and prayed.

17. One day when he was teaching, Pharisees and doctors of the Law were in the crowd. People came from every village of Galilee, Judea and Jerusalem. Gods power was with him to heal.

18. Men brought a man on a bed. He was paralyzed. They tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.

19. They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd. So they went up to the housetop and let the man and the bed down through the tiles to Jesus.

20. Seeing their faith, Jesus said: »Man your sins are forgiven you.«

21. The scribes and the Pharisees reasoned saying: »Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?«

22. Jesus perceived their reasoning and said to them: »Why do you reason in your hearts?

23. »Which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or arise and walk?

24. »So you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,« he said to the man who was paralyzed, »I say to you, arise, take up your bed and go to your house.«

25. Immediately he rose up before them, took his bed and departed to his house, glorifying God.

26. Everyone was amazed and they glorified God. They were filled with fear. They said: »We have seen strange things today.«

27. After that he met a tax collector named Levi sitting at his place of business. He told him: »Follow me.«

28. He gave up everything and followed him.

29. Levi made him a great feast in his house. There was a large group of tax collectors and of others that were sitting at the meal with them.

30. And the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus disciples. They asked: »Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?«

31. Jesus answered them: »Those who have good health do not need a physician. The sick do.

32. »I did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.«

33. They said: »The disciples of John fast often and make supplications. So do the disciples of the Pharisees. But yours eat and drink.«

34. Jesus replied: »Could you make the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?

35. »The days will come and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.«

36. He told an illustration to them: »No one takes a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise he will tear the new. Also the new will not match the old.

37. »No one puts new wine in old wine skins. The new wine will burst the old skins and spill the wine.

38. »But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins.

39. »After drinking old wine no one desires the new for the old is better.«

## Luke 6

1. Jesus and his disciples went through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples plucked the ears, rubbed them in their hands and ate.

2. Some of the Pharisees asked: »Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?«

3. Jesus answered: »Have you not read what David did when he was hungry. He and his companions,

4. entered into the house of God. They and the others with them ate the showbread holy bread. It is only lawful for the priest to eat it.«

5. He continued: »The Son of man is lord of the Sabbath.«

6. He entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath and taught. There was a man there whose right hand was withered.

7. The scribes and the Pharisees watched to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. They looked for a way to accuse him.

8. He knew their thoughts. So he said to the man that had the withered hand: »Stand up and come here.« He arose and stepped forward.

9. Jesus said: »I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm? Is it lawful to save a life, or to destroy it?«

10. He looked around at everyone and said to the man: »Stretch out your hand.« And he did so and his hand was restored.

11. They were all very angry and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.

12. He went to the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God.

13. The next day he called his disciples to choose from them twelve, whom he named apostles ambassadorsmessengers:

14. Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,

15. and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealous one,

16. And finally there was Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

17. He came down with them, and stood on a level place. A great crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem came to hear him. Others from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.

18. Those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.

19. The crowd tried to touch him for power came forth from him and healed them all.

20. He looked at his disciples and said: »Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God.

21. »Blessed are you who hunger now for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now: for you shall laugh.

22. »Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of mans sake.

23. »Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For your reward is great in heaven. Your fathers treated the prophets the same way.

24. »Woe to you who are rich! You have received your reward.

25. »Woe to you who are full now! For you will hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! You will mourn and weep.

26. »Woe to you when all men speak well of you! Their fathers did the same to the prophets.

27. »I tell you who listen, love your enemies and do good to those who hate you.

28. »Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who despitefully use you.

29. »When someone slaps you on one cheek offer the other. Give your coat to the one who takes your topcoat.

30. »Give to every one who asks of you and do not demand back your goods from he who takes from you.

31. »As you would like men to do to you, do also to them.

32. »If you love those who love you what thanks do you have? Even sinners love those who love them.

33. »If you do good to those who do good to you what thanks do you have? Even sinners do the same.

34. »If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what thanks do you have? Even sinners lend to sinners to receive again as much.

35. »Love your enemies and do good to them. Lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great. You will be sons of the Most High for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.

36. »Be merciful even as your Father is merciful.

37. »Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.

38. »Give and it shall be given to you. You will receive a good measure. It will be pressed down, shaken together, running over and they will give it to you. For with the measure that you measure out it will be measured to you also.«

39. He told them an illustration: »Can the blind guide the blind? Would they both fall into a pit?

40. »The disciple is not above his teacher. Every one will be like his teacher when he is fully trained.

41. »Why do you see the speck in your brothers eye? Yet you do not consider the beam in your own eye.

42. »How can you say to your brother: Let me remove the speck in your eye when you do not notice the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye.

43. »A good tree does not produce corrupt fruit and a corrupt tree does not produce good fruit.

44. »The identity of a tree is made clear by the fruit it produces. Men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble.

45. »The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good. The evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth that which is evil. Out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.

46. »Why do you call me Lord, and do not do what I tell you to do?

47. »Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.

48. »He is like a man building a house. He dug and laid a deep foundation upon the rock. A flood sent a stream of water against the house and could not shake it because it was well built.

49. »He who hears but does not do is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation. A flood will send a stream of water and immediately it will fall. The ruin of that house will be great.«

## Luke 7

1. After he taught the people he went to Capernaum.

2. A centurions servant, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and at the point of death.

3. When he heard about him he contacted Jesus through the Jewish elders. He asked him to come and save his servant.

4. They came to Jesus and earnestly pleaded with him saying: »He is worthy and you should do this for him.

5. »He loves our nation and he also built our synagogue for us.«

6. Jesus went with them. As he approached the house, the centurion sent friends to him saying, »Lord do not trouble yourself. I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.

7. »I am also not worthy to come to you. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

8. »I also am a man with much authority. I am in charge of soldiers and say to this one go and he goes and to another I say come and he comes. I tell my servant to do this and he does it.«

9. Jesus heard this and marveled at him. He turned to the crowd and said, »I tell you I find no greater faith in Israel.«

10. When the messengers returned to the house they found the servant in good health.

11. After that he, his disciples and a great crowd went to a city called Nain.

12. When he came near the gate of the city he saw people carrying a dead person. It was the only son of a widow. Many people were with her.

13. When the Lord saw her he had sympathy for her. »Do not cry,« he said.

14. He came near the casket and touched it. The bearers stood still. He said, »Young man arise.«

15. He who was dead sat up and spoke and he was returned to his mother.

16. They were all afraid and they praised God. They said: »A great prophet has appeared among us. God has visited inspectedselected his people.«

17. News about him went through out all Judea and around the region.

18. The disciples of John told him the news.

19. John sent two of his disciples to the Lord. They asked, »Should we look for another or are you the one?«

20. When the men found him they said: »John the Baptist sent us. Are you the one who comes or should we look for another?«

21. In that hour he cured many diseases, plagues and evil spirits. Sight was restored to the blind.

22. He answered Johns disciples: »Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard. The blind receive their sight! The lame walk and lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear! The dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them.

23. »Blessed is he who is not offended by me.«

24. After Johns disciples departed he told the crowd about John: »What did you go into the wilderness to find? Was it a reed shaken with the wind?

25. »What did you go to see, a man clothed in fancy clothes? Only kings dress in fancy clothes.

26. »What did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet.

27. »This is he of whom it is written, Behold I send my messenger before you. He will prepare a way before you.

28. »I say to you, of those who are born of women there is none greater than John. Yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.«

29. When the people heard, they acknowledged Gods justice. They received their baptism from John.

30. The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God and were not baptized by him.

31. »To whom or what should I compare the men of this generation?

32. They are like children that sit in the marketplace and call to each other. We played the flute for you but you did not dance. We wailed and you did not weep.

33. »John the Baptist came fasting and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon.

34. »The Son of man came eating and drinking, and you say look he is a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!

35. »All her children vindicate wisdom.«

36. One of the Pharisees asked him to dine with him. He went to the Pharisees house and sat down to eat.

37. A sinful woman went to the Pharisees house. She brought an alabaster vase filled with ointment.

38. Standing by his feet weeping, she wet his feet with her tears. She wiped them with the hair of her head. Then she kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.

39. The Pharisee saw it and thought to himself if this man were a prophet he would know what kind of woman touched him. She is a sinner.

40. Jesus said to Simon: »I have something to tell you.« He replied: »What teacher?«

41. »A certain lender had two debtors. One owed five hundred shillings and the other fifty.

42. »They did not have money to pay the debt so he forgave them both. Which of them did he love the most?«

43. Simon answered: »I suppose it was the one whom he forgave the most.« Jesus said: »Your judgment is correct.«

44. Turning to the woman, he said to Simon: »See this woman? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet. She watered my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.

45. »You did not kiss me. Since the time I came in she has not ceased kissing my feet.

46. »You did not anoint my head with oil. She anointed my feet with ointment.

47. »She loved much! She has many sins and they are forgiven. When little is forgiven, little love is shown.«

48. He said to her: »Your sins are forgiven!«

49. Those who ate with him said within themselves: »Who is this who even forgives sins?«

50. He said to the woman: »You are saved because of your faith. Go in peace.«

## Luke 8

1. Jesus and the twelve apostles traveled through cities and villages preaching the good news of the kingdom of God.

2. Traveling with him were the women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities. This included Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.

3. Also healed was Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna. There were many others, who supported them out of their private substance.

4. A great crowd came to him from every city. He spoke to them with an illustration:

5. »The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed some fell by the side of the road. It was trampled under foot and the birds of heaven devoured it.

6. »Other seed fell on the rock. As soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture.

7. »Still other seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew with it, and choked it.

8. »Other seed fell on the good ground. It grew and produced fruit a hundredfold.« As he said these things he cried. He said: »He who has ears to hear let him hear.«

9. His disciples asked him what this illustration means.

10. He said: »You are meant to know the secrets of the kingdom of God. I speak to the rest in illustrations, that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand.

11. »Now the illustration is this: The seed is the word of God.

12. »Those by the side of the road are they who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved.

13. »Those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy. These have no root. They believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.

14. »The seeds that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word and go their own way. They are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not produce fruit.

15. »The good ground represents the honest and good-hearted people. They hear the word, hold fast to it and produce forth fruit with patience.«

16. »No one lights a lamp and puts a cover over it or hides it under a bed. Instead he places it on a stand that everyone entering may see the light.

17. »Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed. Nothing is secret that will not be made known and come to light.

18. »Pay attention and hear! Whoever has will be given more. Whoever does not have, more will be taken away, and even what he thinks he has will be taken.«

19. His mother and brother tried to come to him but could not because of the crowd.

20. They told him: »Your mother and your brothers are near. They wish to see you.«

21. He answered, »My mother and my brother are these who hear the word of God, and do it.«

22. He said to his disciples: »Let us go to the other side of the lake.« Then he and his disciples boarded a boat and did so.

23. Jesus fell asleep as they sailed to the other side. A large windstorm came to the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.

24. They awoke him saying: »Master, Master, we parish!« He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and there was calm.

25. He asked them, »Were is your faith?« They were afraid and they marveled. They asked: »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?«

26. They arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is near Galilee.

27. When he arrived on the shore, a demon-possessed man met him. He wore no clothes and did not live in a house but in the tombs. He had been this way a long time.

28. When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down in front of him. He shouted in a loud voice: »What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I implore you do not torment me.«

29. The spirit seized him many times. For this reason he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the deserts. Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man!

30. Jesus asked him: »What is your name?« He answered: »Legion« for many demons had entered into him.

31. They pleaded with him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.

32. There was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. They entreated him that he would allow them to enter into them. He gave them permission.

33. The demons came out from the man and entered into the swine. The herd rushed down the hill into the lake, and was drowned.

34. The herdsmen saw what happened and rushed to the city to tell others.

35. They went out to see what happened. They came to Jesus and found the man who had been demon possessed. He was clothed, in his right mind and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were afraid.

36. They then learned how he was possessed with demons and became whole.

37. The people of the country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart. They were very much afraid. So he boarded a boat and left.

38. The man who once had demons asked him if he could go with him. Jesus sent him away saying:

39. »Return to your house and declare the great things God has done for you.« He went throughout the whole city telling the great things Jesus had done for him.

40. When Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him. They were all waiting for him.

41. Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue came to Jesus. He fell down at Jesus feet and implored him to come to his house.

42. His twelve-year old daughter was dying. She was his only daughter. As he went the crowds surrounded him.

43. There was a woman having an issue of blood twelve years. She spent all her money on physicians, and could not be healed by any.

44. She came behind him and touched the border of his garment. Immediately the issue of blood stopped.

45. Jesus said: »Who touched me?« Peter and the others with him said: »Master, the people press in from all sides.«

46. Jesus said: »Someone did touch me. I perceived that power went from me.«

47. When the woman knew she was discovered she trembled, fell down before him and declared in the presence of all the people why she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.

48. He said to her: »Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace.«

49. While he yet spoke someone came from the ruler of the synagogues house saying: »Your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher.«

50. When Jesus heard this he said: »Do not fear, only believe and she will be made whole.«

51. When he arrived at the house he allowed only the mother and father of the girl, Peter, John and James to enter with him.

52. They were all weeping and morning her. He said: »Do not weep for she is not dead, but sleeps.«

53. They laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead.

54. He took her hand and called: »Maiden, arise.«

55. Her life force returned and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given her to eat.

56. Her parents were amazed. He charged them to tell no man what had been done.

## Luke 9

1. He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.

2. He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

3. He said, »Take nothing for your journey. Do not take a staff or food or money. Do not even take two coats.

4. »Stay at the house you enter until you depart.

5. »If someone does not receive you, when you leave the city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against that person.«

6. They departed and went throughout the villages preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.

7. Herod the ruler of Galilee heard of all that was done and was very perplexed confusedskeptical. Some said John the Baptist was raised from the dead and that he did it.

8. Others said that Elijah had appeared and others and that one of the old prophets had risen again.

9. Herod said: »I beheaded John, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?« He wanted to see him.

10. When the apostles returned they told Jesus about the things they had done. They traveled to the city of Bethsaida.

11. The crowds followed him and he welcomed them. He spoke to them about the kingdom of God. He healed many who were sick.

12. As the day wore on the twelve came to him and said: »Send the people away, that they may go into the villages and country nearby to find lodging and get food, for we are here in a lonely place.«

13. He said to them: »You feed them.« They replied: »We have no more than five loaves and two fishes unless we should go and buy food for all these people.«

14. There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.

15. They did so, and made them all sit down.

16. He took the five loaves and the two fishes. Looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke the bread. Then he gave them to the disciples to pass out to the crowd.

17. They ate and were all filled. Twelve baskets of left over pieces remained.

18. After he prayed the disciples went to him. He asked them: »Who do the crowds say that I am?«

19. They said: »John the Baptist. Others say Elijah and still others say one of the old prophets has risen again.«

20. »But who do you say I am?« He asked. Peter answered him: »The Christ of God.«

21. He commanded them to tell this to no man.

22. The Son of man must suffer many things, he told them. The elders, chief priests and scribes will reject him and kill him. The third day he will be raised up.

23. He told them all: »If any man would come after me let him deny himself. Let him take up his stake of self-denial daily, and follow me.

24. »He who would save his life shall lose it. He who would lose his life for my sake shall save it.

25. »For what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?

26. »If any man is ashamed of my teachings, and of me the Son of man will be ashamed of that person. This will happen when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.

27. »I tell you the truth, there are some here who shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.«

28. About eight days after he said these things he took Peter, John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.

29. While he prayed his appearance changed and his clothes became white and brilliant.

30. Moses and Elijah talked to him.

31. They appeared in glory and spoke about the death he was about to experience at Jerusalem.

32. Peter and his companions were very sleepy. When they awoke they saw his brilliance and the two men that stood with him.

33. Before they left Peter said to Jesus: »Master it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles. We could make one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.« He did not know what he was saying.

34. While he said these things a cloud enveloped them and they were filled with fear.

35. A voice came out of the cloud saying: »This is my Son my chosen one. Listen to him!«

36. When the voice came Jesus was found alone. They kept quiet and told no man what they had seen.

37. After they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him.

38. A man in the crowd cried, »Teacher, please look at my son. He is my only child.

39. »A spirit controls him and suddenly he cries out. He foams at the mouth. It throws him into convulsions and he is badly bruised.

40. »I asked your disciples to cast it out and they could not.«

41. Jesus answered: »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring your son to me.«

42. When he came near the demon slammed him down and through him in to a convulsion. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.

43. They were all overwhelmed by the greatness of God. Everyone marveled at all the things he did. Jesus said to his disciples:

44. »Let these words sink into your ears. The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.«

45. They did not understand what he said. The meaning was concealed from them. They could not comprehend it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.

46. They reasoned among themselves which of them was the greatest.

47. When Jesus detected the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side.

48. Then he said to them: »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. He who is least among you will be the greatest!«

49. John said: »Master we saw some one casting out demons in your name. So we prevented him from doing this because he does not follow us.«

50. Jesus said: »Do not forbid him for he that is not against you is for you.«

51. The days were approaching for his ascension. He was determined to go to Jerusalem.

52. He sent messengers ahead of him. They entered the village of the Samaritans to get ready for him.

53. They did not receive him because he traveled to Jerusalem.

54. When his disciples James and John saw this they said: »Lord, do you want us to request fire from heaven to consume them?«

55. He turned and rebuked them.

56. They went to another village.

57. On the way a man came to him and said: »I will follow you wherever you go.«

58. Jesus told him: »Foxes have holes and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.«

59. He told another: »Follow me.« But he said: »Lord first let me go bury my father.«

60. »Let the dead bury the dead. You go and publish abroad the kingdom of God.« Jesus replied.

61. Another said: »I will follow you Lord, but first let me go say good by to my relatives.«

62. Jesus responded: »No man, who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«

## Luke 10

1. The Lord appointed seventy disciples and sent them in groups of two into every city and place where he was about to go.

2. He said to them: »The harvest indeed is great but the laborers are few. Pray that the Master ControllerLord of the harvest will send laborers into his harvest.

3. »Go your way for I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. »Carry no purse, no wallet, and no shoes; and greet no man on the way.

5. »When you enter a house say; may this house have peace.

6. »If a son of peace lives there, your peace shall rest upon him. If not, it shall return to you again.

7. »Remain in that house eating and drinking what they give you. The laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not stay in different houses.

8. »When they receive you in their city eat what ever they set before you.

9. »Heal the sick that are there and say to them, the kingdom of God is near you.

10. »If they do not receive you in their city go into their streets and,

11. »Shake off the dust that clings to your feet, from that city, so they may know that the kingdom of God came near.

12. »I tell you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

13. »Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. »It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.

15. »Will you Capernaum be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to the grave.

16. »He that hears you hears me; and he that rejects you rejects me and he that rejects me rejects him that sent me.«

17. The seventy returned with joy, saying, »Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.«

18. He said to them: »I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven.

19. »Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any way hurt you.

20. »Do not rejoice about this that the spirits are subject to you. Rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.«

21. In that same hour he rejoiced in Holy Spirit and said: »I thank you Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you did hide these things from the wise and the understanding and revealed them to babes. Father, it is pleasing in your sight.

22. »All things have been delivered to me from my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father. And no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.«

23. Turning to the disciples, he said privately: »Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see.

24. »I tell you many prophets and kings desired to see the things you see and did not see them. To hear the things you hear and did not hear them.«

25. A lawyer stood up to test him. He asked: »Teacher what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?«

26. He said: »What is written in the law? How do you read it?«

27. He answered: »Love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your life, with all your strength and with all your mind. Feelings and total existenceMight and total thinking capacity And you should love your neighbor as yourself.« (Deuteronomy 6:5) (Leviticus 19:18)

28. He told him: »You answered correctly, do this and you will live.«

29. Desiring to justify himself, he said to Jesus: »Who is my neighbor?«

30. Jesus answered: »A man traveled from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell among robbers. They stripped him, beat him and left him half dead.

31. »A priest traveled on that road. When he saw him he passed by on the other side.

32. »When a Levite came to the place he saw the man and passed by on the other side.

33. »Then a Samaritan arrived where he was. He was moved with compassion when he saw him.

34. »He went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn to take care of him.

35. »The next day he paid the host two shillings. He said take care of him and if you spend more I will repay you when I return.

36. »Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?«

37. He said: »The one who showed mercy to him.« Jesus said to him: »Go and you do like wise.«

38. Along the way he entered a village. A woman named Martha received him into her house.

39. Her sister Mary sat at the Lords feet and heard his word.

40. Martha was worried about the housework. She approached Jesus and said: »Lord do you not care that my sister does not help me? Tell her to help me.«

41. The Lord answered: »Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.

42. »However one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the proper way and it shall not be taken away from her.«

## Luke 11

1. Jesus was praying. When he finished one of his disciples said to him: »Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.«

2. He said: »When you pray say, Father holy sacredsanctifiedblessedconsecrated is your name. Let your kingdom come.

3. »Give us day-by-day our daily bread.

4. »Forgive us our sins. For we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And keep us from temptation.«

5. He also said: »Which of you have a friend you would approach at midnight and say lend me three loaves.

6. »This is because a friend of mine is visiting and I do not have any food to feed him.

7. »You hear a voice from the house say, The door is shut, my children are in bed, do not bother me. I cannot rise and help you.«

8. »I tell you even if he will not rise and give you what you need because he is your friend, he will arise and give you what you need because you keep asking.

9. »I say to you: Ask and it will be given you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened to you.

10. »Every one who asks receives. Everyone who seeks will find. It will be opened to everyone who knocks.

11. »What father would give his son a stone when he asked for a loaf? What father would give a serpent when his son asked for a fish?

12. »If he asked for an egg would he give a scorpion?

13. »If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?«

14. He cast out a demon from a dumb man. When the demon left the man he spoke and the crowds were astonished.

15. Some of them said: »Beelzebub the prince of the demons casts out demons.«

16. Others tested him demanding a sign from heaven.

17. He knew their thoughts. So he told them: »Every kingdom that is divided is destroyed. A house divided against itself falls.

18. »If Satan is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand? You say I cast out demons with the help of Beelzebub.

19. »If Beelzebub helps me cast out demons, who helps your sons cast them out? They will be your judges.

20. »If I use the finger powerSpirit (Exodus 31:18) (2 Corinthians 3:3) of God to cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you?

21. »When the fully armed strong man guards his own palace, his goods are safe.

22. »When some one stronger comes to him and overpowers him he takes away his armor and steels his possessions.

23. »He who is not with me is against me. He who does not help me gather actually scatters.

24. »When an unclean spirit leaves a man it passes through desolate places. It seeks rest and finds none. It says, I will return from where I came.

25. »When he returns he finds the place swept and adorned.

26. »He then takes seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell. The last condition of that man becomes worse than the first.«

27. As he was talking a woman out of the crowd shouted: »Blessed is the woman who bore you and nursed you.«

28. He replied: »More blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it.«

29. When the crowd gathered to him, he said: »This generation is evil. It seeks a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.

30. »Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites; the Son of man will be a sign to this generation.

31. »The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation. She will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon and one greater than Solomon is here now.

32. »The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation. They will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and someone greater than Jonah is here now.

33. »No man lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a bushel. He puts it on a table so those who enter may see the light.

34. »The lamp of your body is your eye. When your eye is clear your entire body is full of light. When it is evil your body is full of darkness.

35. »Make sure the light that is in you is not darkness.

36. If your entire body is full of light and has no darkness you will have no part of the dark. Just as a lamp when shinning brightly gives plenty of light.«

37. As he spoke a Pharisee invited him to dine with him. He accepted the invitation and went to eat.

38. The Pharisee wondered about Jesus not bathing before dinner.

39. The Lord said: »You Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter. Yet your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.

40. »You foolish ones. Did he that made the outside also make the inside?

41. « Give that which is within as charity. Then all things are clean for you.

42. »Woe to you Pharisees! You tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God. You should have done these but you leave them undone.

43. »Woe to you Pharisees! You love the prominent seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.

44. »Woe to you! You are as the tombs that do not appear and men walk over them and do not know it.«

45. One of the lawyers said to him: »Teacher, you also insult us by saying this.«

46. Jesus said: »Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to bear. And you will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. »Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. »Therefore you are witnesses and consent to the works of your fathers. They killed them and you build their tombs.

49. »It is for this reason the wisdom of God said, I send to them prophets and apostles and they will persecute and kill some of them.

50. »The blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation.

51. »This includes the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. I tell you it will be required of this generation.

52. »Woe to you lawyers, for you took away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves and you hindered those entering.«

53. When he left there the scribes and the Pharisees became hostile with him. They tried to quarrel with him about many things.

54. They plotted against him and tried to catch him in something he might say.

## Luke 12

1. Thousands of people in the crowd were gathered together so much that they bumped into one another. He said to his disciples: »First of all, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. »Everything covered up will be revealed. Everything hidden will be made known.

3. »That which you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. That which you have spoken in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.

4. »I tell you my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body. After that they can do no more.

5. »I will show you the one to fear. Fear the one who, after he has killed, has power to destroy you throw into the ever-burning trash fires of the valley of HinnomGreek: Gehenna. This is one you should fear.

6. »Are not five sparrows sold for two coins of small value? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.

7. »Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.

8. »I tell you, every one who confesses me before men; the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.

9. »He who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.

10. »He who speaks against the Son of man will be forgiven. However he who blasphemes against Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

11. »When you are brought before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about what you will say to answer them.

12. »Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should say.«

13. A member of the crowd said: »Teacher, help my brother divide the inheritance with me.«

14. Then he said: »Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?«

15. Jesus said: »Be careful, do not covet, for life does not come from your possessions.«

16. He spoke an illustration to them: »The land of a rich man produced well.

17. »He reasoned to himself, what will I do? I have nowhere to store my fruits?

18. »He said: »I would pull down my barns and build larger barns. I will store all my grain and goods there.

19. »I will say to my self: You have many possessions saved for many years. Take it easy and eat, drink and be merry.

20. »But God said to him: You fool this night you will give up your life. Then who will have all these things you accumulated?

21. »He who lays up earthly treasure for himself is not rich toward God.«

22. He told his disciples: »Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you eat or what you wear on your body.

23. »Life is more than food and clothing.

24. »Consider the ravens for they do not sow or reap. They have no storehouse or barn. Yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!

25. »Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to your life?

26. »If you are not able to do even that which is least why worry about the rest?

27. »Consider the way the lilies grow. They do not toil and neither do they spin. Yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

28. »If God clothes the grasses in the field, which is here today and is cast into the oven tomorrow, how much more will he clothe you? You have little faith.

29. »Do not seek food and drink and do not worry.

30. »For the people of the nations seek after these things. Your Father knows that you need them.

31. »Seek first his kingdom and these things will be added to you.

32. »Do not fear little flock for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

33. »Sell your possessions and give to charity. Make yourselves purses that do not get old, a treasure in heaven where moth and rest cannot corrupt and thieves cannot steal.

34. »Your heart will be where your treasure is.

35. »Gird your loins strengthen yourselves and light your lamps.

36. »Be like men looking for their master to return. He will knock when he returns from the marriage feast, and it will immediately be opened to him.

37. »Those servants are blessed, for the master will find them alert when he comes. I tell you he will tighten his belt, have them sit down at the table, and he will serve them the meal.

38. »Even if he comes in the second watch or the third and he finds the same his servants are blessed.

39. »Know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched. He would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

40. »You be ready! The Son of man will come at a time when you do not think he will.«

41. Peter said: »Lord are you speaking this illustration to us or to everyone?«

42. The Lord said: »Who is the faithful and wise steward, whom his master shall appoint over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?

43. »That servant will be blessed when his master comes and finds him doing so.

44. »I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all that he has.

45. »If that servant says in his heart, my master delays his coming; and beats the other servants and eats and drinks to excess,

46. the master of that servant will come when he does not expect. He will come in an hour that he does not know. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.

47. »The unfaithful servant who knew what his master wanted and did not do it will be beaten.

48. »He who did not know and did things unacceptable will receive a lesser punishment. To whom much is given, much will be required and to whom they commit much they will demand even more.

49. « I came to strike fire upon the earth and what do I care if it is already kindled?

50. »I have a baptism to experience and I am distressed until it is accomplished!

51. »Do you think I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, No, instead division.

52. »From now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. »They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.«

54. He said to the crowd: »When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say it will rain and it does.

55. »When you see a south wind blowing, you say there will be scorching heat and there is.

56. »You hypocrites, you know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven but how is it that you do not know how to interpret this time?

57. »Why do you not judge what is right?

58. »For example when an opponent brings you to court, try to settle before you get there. Otherwise, he will drag you in front of a judge and the judge will hand you over to an officer who will throw you into prison.

59. »I tell you that you will not get out until you pay every penny of your fine.«

## Luke 13

1. Some people there gave him an account of how Pilate killed some Galilaeans while they offered sacrifices.

2. Jesus said: »Do you think the way those Galileans were killed prove they were worse sinners than all Galileans?

3. »It does not! I tell you; if you do not turn from your sins, you will die as they did.

4. »What about the eighteen people in Siloam killed when the castle tower fell on them? Do you think this proves that they were worse than all the other people living in Jerusalem?

5. »It does not! I tell you if you do not turn from your sins, you will die as they did.«

6. Jesus told them an illustration: »There was a man who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. He looked for figs on it but found none.

7. »So he told his gardener, I have been coming here looking for figs on this tree for three years. I have not found any. So cut it down! Why should it continue using the soil?

8. »But the gardener said: Just give it one more year, sir. I will dig around it, fertilize it and leave it alone.

9. »If the tree bears figs next year it will be good. If it does not you can have it cut down.«

10. Jesus was teaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath.

11. A woman had an evil spirit that kept her sick for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not stand straight.

12. Jesus called to her: »Woman you are free from your sickness!«

13. He touched her and at once she stood straight up and praised God.

14. The official of the synagogue was angry that Jesus healed on the Sabbath. He told the people: »There are six days in which we should work. Come during those days and be healed, not on the Sabbath!«

15. The Lord answered: »You hypocrites! You would untie your ox or your donkey from the stall and take it out to give it water on the Sabbath.

16. »Here is a descendant of Abraham whom Satan has kept in bonds for eighteen years. Should she be released on the Sabbath?«

17. His answer shamed his enemies. The people rejoiced over the wonderful things he did.

18. Jesus continued: »To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God? What is it like?«

19. »It is like this. A man plants a mustard seed in his field. The plant grows and becomes a tree. The birds make their nests in its branches.«

20. Again Jesus asked: »With what should I compare the Kingdom of God?

21. « It is like this. A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour. Soon the whole batch of dough rises.«

22. Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching the people and traveling toward Jerusalem.

23. Someone asked him, »Will only a few people be saved?« Jesus answered them:

24. »Strive to go in through the narrow door. Many people will try to go in and will not be able.

25. »The master of the house will close the door. You stand outside and knock on the door and say: Open the door for us, sir! He will answer: I do not know where you come from!

26. »Then you will answer, we ate and drank with you. You taught in our town!

27. »Again he will say: I do not know where you come from. Get away from me, you wicked people!

28. »You will cry and grind your teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, while you are thrown out!

29. »People will come from east, west, north and south and sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God.

30. »Those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last.«

31. Some Pharisees came to Jesus and warned him: »You must leave and go somewhere else for Herod wants to kill you.«

32. Jesus told them: »Go tell that fox I cast out demons and heal people today and tomorrow. On the third day my work will be finished.

33. « I must go on my way today, tomorrow and the following day. It would not be right that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.

34. »O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets! You stone those sent to you. How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her own brood under her wings. But you would not have it!

35. »Behold, your house is made desolate. I tell you, you shall not see me until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah.« (Psalm 118:26)

## Luke 14

1. Shortly after that he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees. They were there to eat on the Sabbath. They watched him.

2. There was in his presence a man who had the dropsy swollen arms and legs.

3. Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees: »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?«

4. They did not speak. So he held the man and healed him and let him go.

5. He said: »Which of you who has an ass or a bull that falls into a well, and will not immediately pull him up on a Sabbath day?«

6. Again they could not answer.

7. He spoke an illustration to the invited guests. He noticed they chose from the most important seats. So he said to them:

8. »When you are invited to a marriage feast do not take the place of honor. Someone more distinguished than you may be invited.

9. »Your host would tell you, give this person your place. Then you would be embarrassed and have to take the place of least honor.

10. »When you are invited, take the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, friend, move to a more honorable place. And the other guests will see how you are honored.

11. »Those who exalt themselves will be humbled. And people who humble themselves will be exalted.«

12. Jesus said to his host: »When you give a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors. They will invite you back, and in this way you will be paid for what you did.

13. »When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.

14. »You will be blessed because they are not able to pay you back. God will repay you on the day the good people rise from death.«

15. One of the guests at the table then said to Jesus: »Those who sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God will be happy!«

16. Jesus said: »There was a man who gave a great feast to which he invited many people.

17. »He sent his servant to tell the guests that everything is ready.

18. »They all made excuses one after another. The first one told the servant: I bought a field and must go and look at it. Please accept my apologies.

19. »Another said: I purchased five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please accept my apologies.

20. »Another explained: I am newly married and I cannot come.

21. »The servant returned and conveyed this to his master. The master was furious. He commanded his servant to hurry into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring back the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.

22. »The servant soon told his master, Your order has been carried out but there is still more room.

23. »The master told the servant, Go to the country roads and lanes and make people come so my house will be full.

24. »None of those who were invited will taste my dinner!« He said.

25. Jesus turned to speak to the large crowd of people who were traveling with him:

26. »You who come to me may not be my disciple unless you love me more than you love your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters and yourself.

27. »Those who do not carry their own stake and come after me may not be my disciples.

28. »If you plan to build a tower, you sit down first and figure out what it will cost. Then you see if you have enough money to finish the job.

29. »If you do not, you will not be able to finish the project after laying the foundation. Everyone who sees what happened will ridicule and poke fun of you.

30. »You started and could not finish, they will say.

31. « When a king commands ten thousand men to fight another king who comes against him with twenty thousand men, he will sit down first and decide if he is strong enough to defeat the other king.

32. »If he is not strong enough he will send messengers to the other king to ask for terms of peace while he is still far away.«

33. »Likewise,« concluded Jesus, »none of you may be my disciples unless you give up everything you have.«

34. »Salt is good. But if it loses its saltiness it cannot be made salty again.

35. »It is neither good for the soil nor for the manure pile. You throw it away. Listen if you have ears!«

## Luke 15

1. One day a large number of tax collectors and other outcasts came to listen to Jesus.

2. Pharisees and teachers of the Law complained: »This man welcomes sinners and even eats with them!«

3. Then Jesus told them an illustration:

4. »If you have a hundred sheep and lose one of them, what do you do? You leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the pasture and go looking for the one you lost until you find it.

5. »When you find it you are happy. You carry it on your shoulders.

6. »You bring it back home. You invite your friends and neighbors together to celebrate. You say, I am so happy I found my lost sheep.

7. »It is the same. I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine good people who do not need to repent.

8. »Suppose a woman with ten silver coins loses one of them. What does she do? She lights a lamp and sweeps her house. She looks carefully everywhere until she finds it.

9. »When she finds it she calls her friends and says let us celebrate. I am happy I found the lost coin.

10. »I tell you, it is the same for the angels of God who rejoice over one sinner who repents.«

11. Jesus said: »A man had two sons.

12. »The younger one said to him, Father I want my share of the property. He divided his property between his two sons.

13. »In a short time the younger son sold his share of the property. He left home with the money and traveled to a far away country where he wasted his money in reckless living.

14. »He spent everything! When a famine spread over that country he was left with nothing.

15. »He went to work for a citizen of that country who sent him to his farm to take care of the pigs.

16. He wanted to eat the Carob bean pods the pigs ate, but no one gave him anything to eat.

17. »Finally it dawned on him, my fathers hired workers have more than they can eat and I am about to starve!

18. »I will go to my father and say: Father I have sinned against God and against you.

19. »I am not fit to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired workers.

20. »He went to his father. He was a long way from home when his father saw him. His heart filled with pity. He ran and threw his arms around his son and kissed him.

21. »Father, the son said: I have sinned against God and against you. I am not fit to be called your son.

22. »The father called his servants. He said: Hurry and bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet.

23. »Get the prize calf and kill it. Let us celebrate with a feast!

24. »My son was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he has been found. The feasting began.

25. »The older son was out in the field. When he came close to the house he heard music and dancing.

26. « He asked one of the servants what was happening?

27. »Your brother returned home, the servant answered. Your father killed the prize calf because he has returned safely.

28. »The older brother was so angry he would not enter the house. His father came out and begged him to come in.

29. »He spoke to his father in anger. All these years I have worked like a slave for you. I have never disobeyed you. What have you given me? Not even a goat for me to have a feast with my friends!

30. »This son of yours wasted all your property on prostitutes. When he comes home you kill the prize calf for him!

31. »The father answered, »My son, you are always here. And everything I have is yours!

32. »We had to celebrate and be happy. Your brother was dead. Now he is alive! He was lost and now he has been found!«

## Luke 16

1. Jesus told his disciples: »There was a rich man who had a servant who managed his property. The rich man learned that the manager was accused of wasting his masters money.

2. »He said: Is it true what I hear about you? Give me a complete accounting of your management of my property for you may not be my manager any longer.

3. »The servant thought: I am fired from my job. What shall I do? I am not strong enough for heavy work and I am ashamed to beg.

4. »I know what I will do when my job is gone. My friends will welcome me in their homes.

5. »He called all the people who were in debt to his master. He asked the first one: How much do you owe my master?

6. »One hundred barrels of olive oil, he said. Here is your bill, he told him; settle for fifty.

7. »He asked another: How much do you owe? A thousand bushels of wheat, he answered. Here is your bill. Pay eight hundred bushels.

8. »The master of the dishonest manager praised him for doing a shrewd thing. People of this world are more astute at handling their affairs than people who belong to the light.

9. Jesus continued: »I tell you, make friends for yourselves with worldly wealth. That way when it gives out, you will be welcomed in the eternal home.

10. »Whoever is faithful in little things will be faithful in large ones. Whoever is unrighteous in small things will be unrighteous in large ones.

11. »If you have not been faithful in handling worldly wealth, how can you be trusted with true wealth?

12. »If you have not been faithful with what belongs to someone else, who will give you what belongs to you?

13. »No one can serve two masters. He will hate one and love the other. He will be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.«

14. Hearing this the Pharisees made fun of Jesus, because they loved money.

15. Jesus said: »You make yourselves look righteous to other people. God knows your hearts. The things considered of great value by people are worth nothing in Gods sight.

16. »The Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets was in effect until John the Baptist. From that time on the Good News about the Kingdom of God is being taught.

17. « It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest detail of the Law to be eliminated.

18. »A man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. The man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Jesus continued to tell illustrations.

19. »A rich man dressed in the most expensive clothes and lived in great luxury every day.

20. »A poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, used to be brought to the rich mans door.

21. »He hoped he could eat the bits of food that fell from the rich mans table. Then the dogs would come and lick his sores.

22. »The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abrahams bosom. The rich man died and was buried.

23. »He was in great torment in the grave hades. He looked up and saw Abraham, far away, with Lazarus at his side.

24. »He called out: Father Abraham! Take pity on me! Please send Lazarus to dip his finger in some water and cool off my tongue. I am in torment in this fire!

25. »Abraham said: Remember, my son, in your lifetime you were given good things, while Lazarus got all the bad things. Now he is enjoying himself while you are in torment.

26. »There is a deep pit lying between us, so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so. And no one can cross over to us from where you are.

27. »The rich man said: I beg you, father Abraham, send Lazarus to my fathers house.

28. »Have him go warn my five brothers that they will not come to this place of torment.

29. »Abraham said: Your brothers have Moses and the prophets to warn them. They should listen to them.

30. « The rich man responded: It is not enough father Abraham! If someone from the dead went to them they would repent.

31. »Abraham said: If they would not listen to Moses and the prophets, they would not listen to someone from the dead.«

## Luke 17

1. Jesus told his disciples: »Things that cause people to stumble do happen. However it is a terrible thing for someone to make them happen!

2. »It would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.

3. »So watch how you behave. Admonish your brother to repent when he sins. Forgive him when he repents.

4. »If he sins against you seven times in one day and repents each time, you must forgive him.«

5. The apostles said to the Lord: »Increase our faith.«

6. He answered: »If your faith was as big as a mustard seed; you could say to this mulberry tree, uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea and it would obey you!

7. »Let us say you have a servant who is plowing or looking after the sheep. Do you tell him to hurry and eat his meal when he comes in from the field?

8. »No you do not. You say to him get my supper ready. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. After that you may have your meal.

9. Does the servant deserve thanks for obeying orders?

10. The same applies to you. When you have done all you have been told to do, you say, we are unworthy servants. We have done what we ought to have done.«

11. Jesus traveled to Jerusalem. He went along the border between Samaria and Galilee.

12. Entering a village he met ten men suffering from a dreaded skin disease.

13. They shouted: »Jesus! Master! Have pity on us!«

14. When he saw them he told them to go show themselves to the priests. They were cleansed on the way.

15. When he was healed, one of them came back and praised God in a loud voice.

16. He fell on his face at Jesus feet and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.

17. Jesus answered: »Were all ten cleansed? Where are the nine?

18. »Were the others not willing to return with this foreigner to give glory to God?

19. He said: »Arise and go your way. Your faith has made you whole.«

20. The Pharisees asked: »When does the kingdom of God come?« Jesus answered them: »The kingdom of God does not come with observable signs.

21. »Neither shall they say it is here or over there! The kingdom of God is here with you in your midstamong you.«

22. He said to the disciples: »The time will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.

23. »They will tell you go here or go there, but do not follow them.

24. »Just as the light from lightning shines from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, so the Son of man will be in his day.

25. »First he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.

26. »The days of the Son of man will be like the days of Noah.

27. »They ate, they drank and they got married until Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came, and destroyed them all.

28. »The days of Lot were similar. They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted and they built.

29. »But when Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

30. »It will be similar in the day that the Son of man is revealed.

31. »A man will be on the housetop. He should not go down into the house to take his possessions. He that is in the field should likewise not return to the house.

32. »Remember Lots wife!

33. »He who seeks to gain his life will lose it. He who loses his life will preserve it.

34. »I tell you, that on that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken learnbe received and the other will be left omitedforsaken.

35. »There will be two grinding together. One will be taken and the other will be left.

36. »There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other will be left.«

37. They asked him: »Where, Lord?« And he said to them: »Where the body is the eagles will also gather.«

## Luke 18

1. He spoke an illustration to them emphasizing the need to pray and not become tired:

2. »There was a judge in a city that did not fear God and had no respect for man.

3. »There was a widow in that same city. She went to him asking for legal protection from her adversary.

4. »At first he refused. Then he thought about it and he said to himself, I do not fear God and have little respect for man.

5. »However this widow bothers me. For this reason I will avenge her. If she keeps coming to me she will wear me out.«

6. The Lord continued: »Pay attention to what the unrighteous judge said.«

7. »Should God avenge his chosen that cry to him day and night, and yet he is longsuffering over them?

8. »I say to you, that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, will the Son of man find faith on the earth when he comes?»

9. He then spoke this illustration to some who trusted in themselves. They were very self-righteous. They looked down on others:

10. »Two men went to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.

11. »The Pharisee stood and prayed like this: God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.

12. »I fast twice per week. I give tithes of all that I get.

13. »But the tax collector stood far away and would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven. He beat his breast, saying: God, be merciful to me a sinner.

14. »I tell you the tax collector and not the Pharisee was right with God when he went home. He who exalts himself will be humbled! He who humbles himself will be exalted!«

15. They brought all their babes to him that he should touch them. When the disciples saw it they rebuked them.

16. Jesus said: »Invite the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them for the kingdom of God belongs to them.

17. »Truly I tell you he who does not receive the kingdom of God like little child, shall in no wise enter it.«

18. A Jewish leader asked: »Good Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«

19. Jesus asked: »Why do you call me good? None is good except one, God.

20. »You know the commandments, do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, and do not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother.«

21. The man replied: »I have observed all these things from my youth.«

22. When Jesus heard it he said to him, »You lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.«

23. But when he heard these things he became very sad for he was very rich.

24. Seeing him Jesus said: »It is very difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

25. »It is easier for a camel to enter in through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.«

26. They heard this and asked: »Than who can be saved?«

27. He replied: »The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.«

28. Peter said: »Indeed we have left our own to follow you.«

29. Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, no man has left house, or wife, or brother, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who shall not receive manifold more now and in the age to come everlasting life.«

31. He took the twelve to Jerusalem so that the Son of man will accomplish all the things that are written through the prophets:

32. »He will be delivered up to the people of the nations, and will be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon.

33. »They will beat and kill him. The third day he will rise.«

34. They did not understand for the meaning was hidden from them. They could not perceive the things he said.

35. He came closer to Jericho where a blind man sat begging by the side or the road.

36. Hearing a crowd go by, he inquired what this meant.

37. They told him: »Jesus of Nazareth passed by.«

38. He cried out: »Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!«

39. They rebuked him and said he should keep quiet. But he cried out even more: »You son of David, have mercy on me!«

40. Jesus commanded that he be brought to him. When he was near he spoke to him.

41. What do you want me to do to you? He said: »Lord, give me my sight!«

42. And Jesus said to him: »Receive your sight! Your faith has made you whole.«

43. Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people who saw it praised God.

## Luke 19

1. Jesus passed through Jericho.

2. There was an important, wealthy, chief tax collector called Zacchaeus.

3. He tried to see who Jesus was. Being a short person he could not see over the crowd.

4. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore fig-mulberry tree near where he would pass by in order to see him.

5. When Jesus came to the place he looked up at Zacchaeus and said: »Come down quickly for today I must visit your home.«

6. He hurried down to receive him joyfully.

7. Many in the crowd complained saying: »He is staying with a man who is a sinner.«

8. Zacchaeus stood before Jesus and said: »Lord, I now give half of all my possessions to the poor. If I have defrauded any one I will give back four times the amount taken.«

9. Jesus said to him: »Salvation has come to this house today. He is also a son of Abraham.

10. »The Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.«

11. They were close to Jerusalem. They assumed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. Jesus responded to their assumption with an illustration.

12. He said: »A nobleman traveled to a country far away to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

13. »He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds, and said do business with this until I return.

14. »His citizens hated him. They sent a spokesman to him saying we do not want this man to rule us.

15. »He received the kingdom and went back to check on his servants. He wanted to know what they had gained by trading with the money he gave them.

16. »The first reported: Your pound has made ten pounds more.

17. »He said: Well done, you good servant. You were faithful in very little. Now you shall have authority over ten cities.

18. »The second said: Your pound, Lord, has made five pounds.

19. »He replied: You should be over five cities.

20. »Another reported: Lord, here is your pound. I kept it stored in a napkin.

21. »I feared you because you are an austere man. You take up what you do not lay down and you reap that which you did not sow.

22. »He said to him: Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.

23. »Why did you not put my money in the bank? That way I could collect interest when I returned.

24. »The nobleman said: Take away the pound he was given and give it to him that has the ten pounds.

25. »They said: Lord he has ten pounds!

26. »I say to you, that every one who has more shall be given. The man who does not have what little he has shall be taken away from him.

27. »Bring my enemies that do not want me to rule over them and kill them in front of me.«

28. After Jesus spoke he went to Jerusalem.

29. When he came close to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples.

30. He told them, »Go into the nearby village. You will find a colt tied. No man has ever sat on him. Untie him and bring him to me.

31. »If any one asks why you untied him say the Lord needs him.«

32. They left and found things to be as he said.

33. The owners found them when they untied the colt and asked why do you untie the colt?

34. They said: »The Lord needs him.«

35. They brought him to Jesus. Then they threw their garments on the colt and Jesus sat on him.

36. As he went, they spread their garments in the way.

37. He was near the descent of the Mount of Olives. The entire crowd of disciples rejoiced and praised God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen.

38. They said: »Blessed is the King that comes in the name of Jehovah! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!« (Psalms 118:26; 134:3)

39. Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, rebuke your disciples.«

40. He answered: »I tell you if these remain quiet the stones will cry out!«

41. When he came close to the city he wept over it.

42. He said: »If you only knew today the things needed to bring peace! But they are hidden from your eyes.

43. »The time is coming when your enemies will surround you and blockade you with a rampart wall on all sides. They will close in on you.

44. »They will knock you and your children down to the ground. They will not leave one stone upon another. Whats more you do not know when this visit will take place.«

45. Jesus entered the temple and drove out the merchants.

46. He said: »It is written my house shall be a house of prayer. You have made it a den of robbers.«

47. Everyday he taught in the temple. The chief priests, scribes and other important men of the people looked for ways to destroy him.

48. They could not find a way for the people listened to every thing he said.

## Luke 20

1. One day when he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the good news he saw the chief priests, scribes and elders.

2. They said to him: »Tell us by what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?«

3. Jesus responded: »I also will ask you a question. Tell me,

4. »The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men?«

5. They reasoned among themselves, »If we say from heaven; he will say why did you not believe him?

6. »If we say from men all the people will stone us. They are persuaded that John was a prophet.«

7. So they answered: »We do not know.«

8. Jesus said: »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«

9. He told the people an illustration: »A man planted a vineyard. He rented it to tenants and went to another country for a long time.

10. »At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters to collect fruit of the vineyard. The renters beat him, and sent him away empty.

11. »He sent another servant who was also treated shamefully, beaten and sent away empty.

12. »A third servant was sent. They wounded him and threw him out.

13. »The owner of the vineyard said, what should I do? I will send my beloved son. Maybe they will respect him.

14. »When the renters saw him they reasoned that this is the heir, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

15. »They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

16. He will come and destroy the renters and will give the vineyard to others. When they heard it, they said, God forbid!

17. »He looked at them and asked what does the scripture mean: The stone that the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner?

18. »Every one that falls on that stone shall be broken to pieces. Every one the stone falls on will be scattered as dust.«

19. The scribes and the chief priests attempted to capture him in that very hour. They feared the people. They perceived that he spoke this illustration against them.

20. They watched him and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous. The spies listened for something in his speech to deliver him up to the authority of the governor.

21. »Teacher,« they said, »we know that you are right in what you say and teach. You are not partial and do not play favorites. Rather you teach the way of God truthfully.«

22. »Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?«

23. He perceived their craftiness, and replied:

24. »Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have?« They said, »Caesars.«

25. He said to them: »Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«

26. They were not able to apprehend him in front of the people. They were amazed by his answer and kept quiet.

27. Some Sadducees came to him. They believe there is no resurrection.

28. They asked him: »Teacher, Moses wrote if a mans brother dies and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed for his brother.

29. »There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.

30. »The same for the second.

31. »The third married her. The remaining of the seven also married her, left no children and died.

32. »Afterward the woman also died.

33. »In the resurrection whose wife shall she be? All seven married her.«

34. Jesus said, »The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage.

35. »Those accounted worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.

36. »They cannot die anymore for they are equal to the angels. They are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

37. »Even Moses showed that the dead are raised when he was near the bush and he called Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. (Exodus 3:6-14)

38. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live for him.«

39. Some of the scribes answered, »Teacher you have said well.«

40. They did not dare to ask any more questions.

41. He asked them a question: »How is it that they say the Christ is Davids son?

42. »For David said in the book of Psalms: Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand.

43. »Till I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. (Psalm 110:1)

44. »David therefore called him Lord, and how is he his son?«

45. He spoke to the disciples while all the people listened:

46. »Beware of the scribes for they walk around in long robes. They love greetings in the marketplaces. They sit in the chief seats in the synagogues and the head tables at feasts.

47. »They devour widows houses. They offer long prayers to show off in front of others. They shall receive great condemnation.«

## Luke 21

1. He saw rich men putting their gifts into the treasury.

2. Then he saw a poor widow putting in two small coins.

3. »I tell you a truth,« he said: »This poor widow gave more than all of them.

4. »They all gave out of their surplus but she gave out of her poverty. She gave all that she had for living expenses.«

5. Some spoke of how wonderful the temple was. How it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus replied:

6. »Concerning these things you see, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.«

7. They asked him: »Teacher, when would these things take place? What will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass?«

8. He said: »Take heed that you are not led astray. Many will come in my name, saying, I am he but the time is not at hand. Do not follow them.

9. »When you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified. These things must occur first. The end is not immediate.«

10. Then he said: »Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. »There will be great earthquakes. There will be famines and pestilences in various places. There shall be terrors and great signs from heaven.

12. »Even before all these things, they will capture you, and persecute you. You will be delivered to synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors for my names sake.

13. »It will give you an opportunity to witness.

14. »Do not think about what you will say before it happens.

15. »I will give you ability to talk and words of wisdom, which your adversaries shall not be able to resist or refute.

16. »Parent, brothers and sisters and friends will turn you over and cause you to be put to death.

17. »Men will hate you because of my name.

18. »Yet not a hair of your head will perish.

19. »You will gain your lives because of your endurance.

20. »When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies you will know that desolation is near.

21. »Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her leave. And let no one from the country enter.

22. »These are days of vengeance! All things written will be fulfilled.

23. »Woe to those who are pregnant and those who nurse a child in those days! There will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.

24. »They will be killed by the edge of the sword. Some will be led captive into all the nations. The people of the nations will tread down Jerusalem until the time of the Nations is fulfilled.

25. »There will be signs in sun and moon and stars. The earth will experience distress of nations in disarray for the roaring of the sea and the waves.

26. »Men will faint out of fear for expectation of the things coming on the world. The powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

27. »Then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28. »When these things begin to happen lift up your heads because your redemption draws near.«

29. He told them an illustration: »Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.

30. »When they produce leaves you know that summer is near.

31. »Even so, when you see these things coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near!

32. »Truly I say to you, this generation shall not pass away, till all things are accomplished.

33. »Heaven and earth will pass away: but my words will not pass away.

34. »Be awake so your hearts are not weighed down. Do not allow the weight of worldly involvement, drunkenness, and cares of this life be a snare when that day suddenly comes.

35. »It will come as a surprise to all who dwell on the face of the earth.

36. »Be on the watch all the time. Pray for the strength to escape all these things in order to stand before the Son of man.«

37. He taught in the temple every day and he stayed on the Mount of Olives at night.

38. The people came early in the morning to hear him in the temple.

## Luke 22

1. The feast of unleavened bread was near. This is called the Passover.

2. The chief priests and the scribes searched for a way to put him to death. But they feared the people.

3. Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot. He was one of the twelve.

4. He went away to discuss with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver Jesus to them.

5. They were glad, and pledged to give him money.

11. »Say to the master of the house: The teacher says; where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?

12. »He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make it ready.«

13. They found things as he described them and they made things ready for the Passover.

14. When it was time he sat down with the apostles.

15. He said to them: »I have earnestly wanted to eat this Passover with you before I die.

16. »I tell you I will not eat it again until it takes place in the kingdom of God.«

17. He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said: »Take this, and share it among yourselves.

18. »I say to you, I shall not drink from the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God comes.«

19. He gave thanks. Then he took the bread, broke it and gave it to them, saying: »This represents my body that is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.«

20. Then he took the cup saying: « This represents the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.

21. »Look, he who betrays me is at the table.

22. »The Son of man indeed goes, as it has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!«

23. They questioned among themselves, which of them would do this thing.

24. Contention grew between them concerning which of them was the greatest.

25. He told them: »The kings of the nations have lordship over them. Those who have authority over them are called Benefactors.

26. »But you should not be this way. He who is the greater among you let him become as the younger. He that is chief among you is he who serves.

27. »Which is greater, he who sits and eats or he who serves? Is it he who sits and eats? However I am in the midst of you as he who serves.

28. »You have continued with me in my temptations.

29. »I assigned a kingdom to you just as my Father assigned it to me.

30. »Just as you eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. »Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.

32. »I prayed for you that your faith would not fail. Once you have turned again strengthen your brothers.«

33. He said: »Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.«

34. Jesus said: »I tell you Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until you deny that you know me three times.«

35. Speaking to them he asked: »When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?« They said: »Nothing.«

36. Now he said: »Take your purse and wallet. If you do not have a sword sell your cloak and buy one.

37. »I tell you that which is written must be fulfilled in me. He was numbered with transgressors for that which concerns me has fulfillment.«

38. They said: »Lord, here are two swords.« And he said to them: »It is enough.«

39. He went to the Mount of Olives as was his custom and the disciples also followed him.

40. When he arrived he said to them: »Pray that you do not enter into temptation.«

41. He went a short distance from them and kneeled down and prayed.

42. He prayed: »Father if it is your will remove this cup from me, nevertheless not my will, but your will be done.«

43. An angel came to him and gave him strength.

44. possible spurious text He was in agony and earnestly prayed. His sweat became, as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.

45. When he finished his prayer he went to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of their sorrow.

46. He said: »Why do you sleep? Arise and pray that you do not enter into temptation.«

47. As he spoke a crowd followed Judas, one of the twelve. They came to him. Judas approached Jesus and kissed him.

48. Jesus said to him: »Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?«

49. Those near him saw what happened and asked: »Lord shall we strike them with a sword?«

50. One of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. Jesus said: »Do not do any more of this.« Then he touched his ear and healed him.

52. Jesus spoke to the chief priests, captains of the temple and elders who came against him: »Did you come as you would against a robber with swords and clubs?

53. »I was with you every day in the temple. Yet you did not lift a hand against me. This is your hour for this power of darkness.«

54. They seized him and led him away. They took him to the high priests house. Peter followed from a distance.

55. They kindled a fire in the midst of the court. They sat down together. Peter sat in the midst of them.

56. A servant girl saw him sitting by the light of the fire. She looked steadfastly upon him and said: »This man was also with him.«

57. He denied it saying: »Woman, I do not know him!«

58. After a little while another saw him, and said: »You are one of them.« Peter replied: »Man I am not!«

59. Another hour passed. Someone else said: »It is true this man was with him for he is a Galilean.«

60. Peter responded: »I do not know what you are talking about!« Immediately, while he spoke he heard the cockcrow.

61. The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him: »Before the cockcrow this day you will deny me three times.«

62. He left there and wept bitterly.

63. The men that held Jesus mocked him and beat him.

64. They blindfolded him, and asked him, saying: »Prophesy: who is it that struck you?«

65. They reviled him and spoke many things against him.

66. The next day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together. They included chief priests and scribes. They led him away to their council, saying:

67. »If you are the Christ, tell us.« But he said to them: »If I tell you, you will not believe:

68. and if I ask you, you will not answer.«

69. »Soon the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.«

70. They all asked: »Are you the Son of God?« He said to them: »You say that I am.«

71. They responded: »What further need do we have for witnesses? We have heard this from his mouth.«

## Luke 23

1. The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.

2. They accused him, saying: »We found this man perverting our nation. He forbids payment of tax to Caesar. He claims to be Christ a king.«

3. Pilate asked him: »Are you King of the Jews?« He answered him: »You say it.«

4. Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: »I find no fault in this man.«

5. They were more insistent saying: »He excites the people throughout all Judea, beginning in Galilee even to this place.«

6. When Pilate heard it, he asked if the man was a Galilean.

7. When he knew that he was from Herods jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod. He was in Jerusalem at that time.

9. He offered many questions but received no answers.

10. The chief priests and the scribes vehemently accused him.

11. And Herod with his soldiers despised him with contempt, and mocked him. They arrayed him in magnificent apparel. Then they sent him back to Pilate.

12. Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that time they were at enmity.

13. Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people.

14. He said: »You brought this man to me as one who perverted the people. I examined him before you and find no fault in this man. He has not done the things you accuse him of.

15. »Herod found no fault and sent him back to us. He has done nothing worthy of death.

16. »I will therefore punish him, and release him.«

17. He must release one prisoner to them at the feast.

18. They cried out in unison: »Take this man away and release to us Barabbas!«

19. He was thrown into prison for insurrection sedition in the city and murder.

20. Pilate spoke to them again desiring to release Jesus.

21. But they shouted, »Impale him! Impale him!«

22. A third time he said to them: »Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no reason to put him to death. I will therefore chastise him and release him.«

23. But they were insistent and spoke in loud voices asking him to impale him. And they prevailed.

24. Pilate pronounced a sentence that what they asked for should be done.

25. He released the man who was in prison for insurrection and murder and he delivered Jesus to their will.

26. They led him away. Simon of Cyrene was traveling from the country. They seized him and forced him to carry the stake for Jesus.

27. A great crowd of people followed. Many women cried and grieved over him.

28. Jesus turned to them and said: »Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children.

29. »The days are coming when they will say blessed are the barren those without children and the breasts that never nursed.

30. »Then they will say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us.

31. »If they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?«

32. Two criminals were to be put to death with him.

33. They came to the place called the skull. They impaled him and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.

34. Jesus said: »Father, forgive them for they do not know what they do.« This verse not found in older manuscripts. They cast lots and divided his garments among themselves.

35. The people stood watching while the rulers scoffed at him, saying: »He saved others let him save himself if this is his chosen, the Christ of God.«

36. The soldiers mocked him and offered him vinegar,

37. saying: »If you are the King of the Jews save yourself.«

38. There was a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. One of the criminals who were hanged complained bitterly to him saying: »Are you the Christ? Save yourself and us.«

40. The other rebuked him saying: »Do you not respect God, seeing you are also condemned?

41. »We are indeed justly condemned for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man has done nothing wrong.«

42. He said: »Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.«

43. He replied: »Today I tell you this. You will be with me in paradise.«

44. It was about the sixth hour. Darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.

45. The sun failed to shine. The veil of the temple was torn in two.

46. Jesus cried with a loud voice: »Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.« After saying this he quit breathing.

47. The centurion saw what was done and glorified God, saying: »Certainly this was a righteous man.«

48. The crowds gathered at this sight. When they saw the things that were done they left beating their breasts.

49. All of his friends and the women who followed him from Galilee stood watching from a distance.

50. Joseph was a member of the council and a good and righteous man.

51. He was from Arimathaea a city of the Jews and was looking for the kingdom of God.

52. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

53. He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth. Then he laid him in a tomb that was carved in stone. No man had ever lain in this tomb.

54. It was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was near.

55. The women from Galilee went with him to see the tomb and the place for the body.

56. They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

## Luke 24

1. It was early in the morning on the first day of the week. They went to the tomb with the spices that they had prepared.

2. The stone was rolled away from the tomb.

3. When they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. They were perplexed about what had happened. Two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.

5. This frightened them and they bowed down prostrate on the ground. The two men said to them: »Why do you seek the living among the dead?

6. »He is not here. He has arisen! Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee.

7. »He said the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be impaled, and the third day rise again.«

8. They remembered his words.

9. When they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

10. They were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them. They told these things to the apostles.

11. These words seemed to be idle talk and they did not believe them.

12. Peter ran to the tomb. Looking inside he saw the linen cloths by themselves. He departed to his home, wondering about that which occurred.

13. That day two of them traveled to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.

14. They talked between themselves about all the things that happened.

15. While they talked and discussed together Jesus came near and walked with them.

16. But their eyes did not permit them to recognize him.

17. He asked: »What are you talking about with each other as you walk?« They stopped walking and were sad.

18. The one named Cleopas answered him: »Do you travel alone in Jerusalem and not know the things that have happened there these days?«

19. He asked: »What things?« They said to him: »The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene. He was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.

20. »The chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death. They impaled him!

21. »We hoped he would redeem Israel. Yes and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.

22. »Some of the women of our company stunned us. They went to the tomb early.

23. »They did not find his body. They said that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.

24. »Others with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women said. He was not there!«

25. He said to them: »You are foolish men. You are slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!

26. »Did the Christ need to suffer these things and enter into his glory?«

27. He explained to them all the Scriptures about the things concerning him. He spoke about Moses and all the prophets.

28. They approached the village where they were going and he appeared to be going further.

29. They persuaded him not to go saying, »Abide with us. It is nearly evening and the day is almost gone.« He stayed with them.

30. When he had sat down with them to eat he took the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them.

31. Their eyes were opened and they knew him. Then he vanished out of their sight.

32. They said to each other: »Were our hearts not burning within us? When he spoke to us in the way and opened the scriptures to us?«

33. They rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven gathered together with others.

34. »The Lord has risen indeed,« they said, »and he appeared to Simon.«

35. And they told the things that happened in the way, how they recognized him when he broke the bread.

36. As they spoke these things he stood in their midst and said: »May you have peace.«

37. But they were afraid and supposed that they saw a spirit.

38. He said to them, »Why are you troubled? And why do you question in your hearts?

39. »See my hands and my feet that it is I. Touch me and see. A spirit does not have flesh and bones like I have.«

40. When he said this he showed them his hands and his feet.

41. While they still did not believe him but were filled with joy and wonder, he asked for something to eat.

42. They gave him a piece of a broiled fish.

43. He took it and ate it in front of them.

44. He said: »These are my words that I spoke to you, while I was yet with you. All things must be fulfilled. They are things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me.«

45. He opened their minds that they might understand the scriptures.

46. He said: »It is written that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day.

47. »Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

48. »You are witnesses of these things.

49. »You see I send the promise of my Father upon you. You are to wait in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.«

50. He led them out until they were near Bethany. Then he lifted up his hands and blessed them.

51. While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.

52. Filled with joy, they bowed down to him in adoration. Then they returned to Jerusalem.

53. They continued blessing God in the Temple.
