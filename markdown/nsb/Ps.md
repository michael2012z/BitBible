3. My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all day long: Where is your God?

4. I remember these things and I pour out my heart within me. I used to go along with the crowd and lead them in procession to the house of God, with the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.

5. Why am I discouraged? Why am I so restless? I put my hope in God for I will still praise him. He is my salvation and my God.

6. I am very discouraged. That is why I will remember you in the land of Jordan, on the peaks of Hermon, on Mount Mizar.

7. One deep sea calls to another at the roar of your waterspouts. All the whitecaps on your waves have swept over me.

8. Jehovah commands his mercy during the day, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.

9. I will ask God, my rock: »Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk around in mourning while the enemy oppresses me?«

10. As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, while they say to me all day long: »Where is your God?«

## Psalms 43

1. Judge me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation. Deliver me from deceitful and unjust people!

2. You are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

3. O send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me! Let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling places.

4. I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy. Upon the lyre I will praise you, O God, my God.

5. Why am I in despair? Why am I so deeply disturbed within me? I will put my hope in God, for I will praise him as my salvation and my God.

## Psalms 44

__Sons of Korah__

1. O God, we have heard with our ears and our fathers told us about the work that you did in their days, in the days of old.

2. You drove out the nations with your own hand great power. Then you planted them; you afflicted the peoples and spread them abroad.

3. It was not with their swords that they took possession of the land. They did not gain victory with their own strength. It was your right hand, your arm power, and the light of your presence that did it, because you were pleased with them.

4. You alone are my king, O God. You won those victories for Jacob.

5. With you we can walk over our enemies. With your name we can trample those who attack us.

6. I do not rely on my bow, and my sword will never save me.

7. You saved us from our adversaries. You put to shame those who hate us.

8. All day long we praise our God. We give thanks to your name forever.

9. Yet you have rejected and disgraced us. You do not even go along with our armies.

10. You make us retreat from the enemy. Those who hate us rob us at will.

11. You give us over to be butchered like sheep and scatter us among the nations.

12. You sell your people for almost nothing, and at that price you have gained nothing.

13. You made us a reproach to our neighbors and an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us.

14. You made our defeat a proverb among the nations so that people shake their heads at us.

15. All day long my disgrace is in front of me. Shame covers my face.

16. This is because of the words of those who insult and slander us, because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger.

17. Although all of this happened to us, we never forgot you. We never ignored your promise.

18. Our hearts never turned away. Our feet never left your path.

19. You crushed us in a place for jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.

20. If we forgot the name of our God or stretched out our hands to pray to another god,

21. would God not find out, since he knows the secrets in our hearts?

22. We are being killed all day long because of you. We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.

23. Wake up! Why are you sleeping, O Jehovah? Awake! Do not reject us forever!

24. Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our suffering and misery?

25. We are bowing in the dust. Our bodies cling to the ground.

26. Arise! Help us! Rescue us because of your loving kindness!

## Psalms 45

10. Listen, O daughter, pay attention and incline your ear: Forget your people and your father's house.

11. Then the King will desire your beauty. Bow down to him because he is your Lord.

12. The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift. The rich among the people will seek your favor.

13. The King's daughter is all glorious within. Her clothing is interwoven with gold.

14. She will be led to the King in embroidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, will be brought to you.

15. They will come forward with gladness and rejoicing. They will enter into the King's palace.

16. In place of your fathers will be your sons. You will make them princes in all the earth.

## Psalms 62

__Psalm of David__

1. I wait silently for my God. My salvation comes from him.

2. He alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my stronghold. I cannot be severely shaken.

3. How long will all of you attack a man? How long will you try to murder him, as though he were a leaning wall or a sagging fence?

4. They plan to force him out of his high position. They are happy to lie. They bless with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse.

5. I will wait calmly for God alone, because my hope comes from him.

6. He alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my stronghold. I cannot be shaken.

7. My salvation and my glory depend on God. God is the rock of my strength, my refuge.

8. Trust him at all times, you people. Pour out your hearts in his presence. God is our refuge.

9. Common people are only a vapor in the wind. Important people are only a delusion. When all of them are weighed on a scale, they amount to nothing. They are less than a vapor in the wind.

10. Do not count on extortion to make you rich. Do not hope to gain anything through robbery. When riches increase, do not depend on them.

11. God has spoken once. I have heard it said twice: Power belongs to God.

12. Loving-kindness belongs to you, O Jehovah. You reward a person based on what he has done.

10. Your congregation lived there. You O God have prepared your goodness for the poor.

__Psalm of David__

1. Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck!

2. I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

3. I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry. My eyes fail, looking for my God.

4. Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who want to destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I have to restore what I did not take away.

5. O God, you know my foolishness. My sins are not hidden from you.

6. Do not let those who wait for you to be shamed through me, Lord Jehovah of Hosts. Do not let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.

7. Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face.

8. I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's children.

9. Zeal for your house consumes me. The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.

10. When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.

11. When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.

12. Those who sit in the gate talk about me. I am the song of the drunkards.

13. But as for me, my prayer is to you, Jehovah, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.

14. Deliver me out of the mire, and do not let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Do not let the floodwaters overwhelm me; neither let the deep swallow me up. Do not let the pit shut its mouth on me.

17. Do not hide your face turn away from your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!

18. Draw near to me and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.

19. You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before you.

20. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.

21. They also gave me gall for my food. In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.

22. Let their table before them become a snare. Let it become retribution and a trap.

23. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see. Let their backs be continually bent.

24. Pour out your indignation on them. Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.

25. Let their habitation be desolate and let no one live in their tents.

26. For they persecute him whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.

27. Charge them with crime upon crime. Do not let them come into your righteousness.

28. Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.

29. I am in pain and distress. O God, Let your salvation protect me.

30. I will praise the name of God with a song. I will magnify him with thanksgiving.

34. Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in it!

35. God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. They shall settle there, and own it.

36. The children also of his servants shall inherit it. Those who love his name shall dwell in it.

4. Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad because of you. Let those who love your salvation continually say: »Let God be magnified!«

12. O God, do not be so distant from me. O my God, come quickly to help me.

13. Let those who accuse me come to a shameful end. Let those who want my downfall be covered with disgrace and humiliation.

14. But I will always have hope. I will praise you more and more.

15. All day long my mouth will tell of your righteousness and of your salvation. I do not know the number.

16. I will come with the mighty deeds of Jehovah God. I will make mention of your righteousness, yours alone.

17. O God, You taught me from my youth, and I still declare your wondrous deeds.

18. And even when I am old and gray, O God, do not forsake me, until I declare your strength to this generation, your power to all who are to come.

19. Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens. You have done great things. God, who is like you?

20. You who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will let me live. You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.

21. Increase my honor and comfort me again.

22. I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God. I sing praises to you with the stringed instrument, Holy One of Israel.

## Psalms 73

__Of Asaph__

1. God is truly good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.

2. But my feet had almost stumbled. They had almost slipped.

3. I was envious of arrogant people when I saw the peace and prosperity that wicked people enjoy.

4. They suffer no pain. Their bodies are healthy.

5. They have no drudgery in their lives like ordinary people. They are not plagued with problems like mankind.

6. That is why arrogance is their necklace and violence covers them like clothing.

7. Their eyes stand out with fatness, and their hearts imagination run wild.

8. They ridicule. They speak maliciously. They speak arrogantly about oppression.

9. They set their mouth in the heavens and their tongue parades through the earth.

10. Therefore his people return here and here they drink waters of abundance.

11. They ask: How does God know? And is there knowledge with the most High?

12. Behold, these are the ungodly. They prosper in the world; they increase in wealth.

13. I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.

14. I have been plagued all day long, and chastened every morning.

15. If I say, I will speak thus; then, I would offend the generation of your children.

16. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me.

17. I understood their end when I went into the sanctuary of God.

18. Surely you set them in slippery places. You threw them down into destruction.

19. How are they destroyed, suddenly! They are utterly consumed with terrors.

20. It is like waking up from a dream, O Jehovah. When you awake you will despise everything they represent.

21. My heart was grieved and I was pierced within.

22. I was so foolish and ignorant: I was like a beast before you.

23. Nevertheless I am continually with you. You hold me by my right hand.

24. You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward you give me honor glory.

25. Who have I in heaven but you? I desire none on earth except you.

26. My flesh and my heart fail: God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.

27. Those who are far from you will perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.

28. It is good for me to draw near to God. I have put my trust in Jehovah God, that I may declare all your works.

## Psalms 74

__Of Asaph__

1. God, why have you rejected us forever? Why do you smoke with anger against the sheep of your pasture?

2. Remember your congregation, which you purchased long ago. For you have redeemed it to be the tribe of your inheritance, Mount Zion, in which you have lived.

3. Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.

4. Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.

5. They behaved like men wielding axes cutting through a thicket of trees.

6. They strike down all its carved work with hatchet and hammers.

7. They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling-place of your name.

8. They said in their hearts: »We will destroy them completely. They burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.«

9. We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophet. There is no one who knows how long.

10. How long, God, will the adversary reproach? Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?

11. Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!

12. Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the middle of the earth.

13. You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the sea monsters Egypts Army in the waters.

14. You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.

15. You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers.

16. The day and the night are yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.

17. You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter.

18. Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Jehovah. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.

19. Do not deliver your turtledove endeared to wild beasts. Do not forget the life of your poor forever.

20. Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.

21. Do not let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.

22. Arise, O God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man treats you with contempt all day.

23. Do not forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.

## Psalms 75

__Of Asaph__

1. We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your name is near and men declare your wondrous works.

2. When I select an appointed time, it is I who judge in righteousness.

3. The earth and all who dwell in it dissolve meltbecome faint hearted. I have firmly set its pillars.

4. I said to the boastful: »Do not boast!« I said to the wicked: »Do not lift up the horn brag about your power!«

5. Do not lift up your horn on high. Do not speak with insolent pride.

6. There is no exaltation from the east, or from the west, or from the desert.

7. God is the Judge; He brings down one and exalts another.

8. Jehovah holds a cup in his hand. The wine foams and is well mixed. So he pours from it. Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs.

9. But as for me, I will declare forever and I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

10. He will remove the horn power of the wicked. The horn power of the righteous will be exalted.

## Psalms 76

__Of Asaph__

1. God is known in Judah. His name is great in Israel.

2. His tabernacle is in Salem Jerusalem. His dwelling place also is in Zion.

3. There He broke the flaming arrows, the shield and the sword and the weapons of war.

4. You are glorious, more majestic than the mountains of prey.

5. The strong and valiant were plundered, they sank into sleep. None of the warriors could use his hands.

6. At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep.

7. You, even you, are to be respected. Who may stand in your presence when once you are angry?

8. You caused judgment to be heard from heaven. The earth feared and was still

9. when God arose to judgment, to save all the humble of the earth.

10. For the wrath of man shall praise you. You will fortify yourself with a remnant of wrath.

11. Make vows to Jehovah your God and fulfill them. Let all who are around him bring gifts to him. He should be respected.

12. He will cut off the spirit of princes. He is awesome to the kings of the earth.

## Psalms 77

__Of Asaph__

1. My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and he listened to me.

2. In the day of my trouble I sought Jehovah. My hand was stretched out in the night, and did not get tired. I refused to be comforted.

3. I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.

4. You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

5. I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

6. I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:

7. Will Jehovah reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?

8. Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?

9. Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?

10. Then I thought: I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.

11. I will remember Jehovah's deeds! I will remember your wonders of old.

12. I will also meditate on all your work and consider your activities.

13. Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary. What god is as great as our God?

14. You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.

15. You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.

16. The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they were agitated. The depths also convulsed.

17. The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.

18. The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightning lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.

19. Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.

20. You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

## Psalms 78

__Of Asaph__

1. Listen, O my people, to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

2. I will open my mouth in an illustration. I will utter dark sayings of old,

3. That we have heard and known and our fathers have told us.

4. We will not conceal them from their children, but tell to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength and his wondrous works that he has done.

5. He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel. This he commanded our fathers that they should teach them to their children,

6. That the generation to come might know, the children to be born, that they may arise and tell to their children,

7. That they should put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God but keep his commandments.

8. They should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God.

9. The sons of Ephraim were archers well equipped with bows. Yet they turned and ran in the day of battle.

10. They did not keep the covenant of God. They refused to walk in his law.

11. They forgot his deeds and his miracles that he had shown them.

12. He wrought wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand up like a heap.

14. He led them with the cloud by day and with a light of fire by night.

15. He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths.

16. He brought forth streams also from the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers.

17. Yet they still continued to sin against him. They rebelled against the Most High in the desert.

18. In their heart they put God to the test by asking food according to their desire.

19. Then they spoke against God. They said: Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

20. Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, and streams were overflowing; Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?

21. Therefore Jehovah heard and was full of wrath. A fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also mounted against Israel,

22. Because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation.

23. Yet he commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven.

24. He rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them food from heaven.

25. Man did eat the bread of angels. He sent them food in abundance.

26. He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens and by his power he directed the south wind.

27. He rained meat upon them like the dust, even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,

28. Then he let them fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.

29. So they ate and were well filled, and their desire he gave to them.

30. Before they had satisfied their desire, while their food was in their mouths,

31. The anger of God rose against them and killed some of their stoutest ones, and subdued the choice men of Israel.

32. In spite of all this they still sinned. They did not believe in his wonderful works.

33. He brought their days to an end like a whisper in the wind. He brought their years to an end in terror.

34. When he killed some of them, the rest searched for him. They turned from their sins and eagerly looked for God.

35. They remembered that God was their rock, that the Most High was their defender.

36. They flattered him with their mouths and lied to him with their tongues.

37. Their hearts were not loyal to him. They were not faithful to his promise.

38. But he is compassionate. He forgave their sin. He did not destroy them. He restrained his anger many times. He did not display all of his fury.

39. He remembered that they were only flesh and blood, a breeze that blows and does not return.

40. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness! How often they caused him grief in the desert!

41. They tested God again and again, and they pushed the Holy One of Israel to the limit.

42. They did not remember his power and the day he freed them from their oppressor,

43. when he performed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the fields of Zoan.

44. He turned their rivers into blood so that they could not drink from their streams.

45. He sent a swarm of flies that bit them and frogs that ruined them.

46. He gave their crops to grasshoppers and their produce to locusts.

47. He killed their vines with hail and their fig trees with frost.

48. He let the hail strike their cattle and bolts of lightning strike their livestock.

49. He sent his fierce burning anger, his rage and fury against them. He sent an army of destroying angels.

50. He cleared a path for his anger. He did not spare them from death. He let the plague take their lives.

51. He destroyed every firstborn in Egypt, the ones born in the tents of Ham when their fathers were young.

52. He led his own people out like sheep and guided them like a flock through the wilderness.

53. He led them safely. They had no fear while the sea covered their enemies.

54. He brought them into his holy land, to this mountain that his power had won.

55. He drove nations out of their way and gave them the land of the nations as their inheritance. He settled the tribes of Israel in their own tents.

56. They tested God Most High and rebelled against him. They did not obey his written instructions.

57. They were disloyal and treacherous like their ancestors. They were like arrows shot from a defective bow.

58. They provoked him to anger indignation because of their illegal worship sites. They made him furious because they worshiped idols.

59. When God heard, he became furious. He greatly abhorred Israel.

60. He abandoned his dwelling place in Shiloh, the tent where he had lived among humans.

61. He allowed his power to be taken captive and handed his glory over to an oppressor.

62. He let swords kill his people. He was furious with those who belonged to him.

63. Fire consumed his best young men, so his virgins were not given in marriage.

64. His priests were cut down with swords. The widows of his priests could not even weep for them.

65. Jehovah woke up like one who had been sleeping, like a warrior sobering up from too much wine.

66. He struck his enemies from behind and disgraced them forever.

67. He rejected the tent of Joseph. He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,

68. but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion he loved.

69. He built his holy place to be like the high heavens, like the earth that he made to last for a long time.

70. He chose his servant David. He took him from the sheep pens.

71. He brought him from tending the ewes that had lambs so that David could be the shepherd of the people of Jacob, of Israel, the people who belonged to Jehovah.

72. With unselfish devotion David became their shepherd. With skill he guided them.

## Psalms 79

__Of Asaph__

1. O God, the nations have invaded the land that belongs to you. They have dishonored defiled your holy temple. They have left Jerusalem in ruins.

2. They have given the dead bodies of your servants to the birds for food. They have given the flesh of your godly ones to the animals.

3. They have shed the blood of your people around Jerusalem as though it were water. There is no one to bury your people.

4. We have become a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us.

5. How long, O Jehovah? Will you remain angry forever? Will your fury zeal continue to burn like fire?

6. Pour your fury anger on the nations that do not know you, on the kingdoms that have not called you.

7. They have devoured Jacob. They have destroyed his home.

8. Do not hold the crimes of our ancestors against us. Reach out to us soon with your compassion, because we are helpless.

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Rescue us, and provide atonement for our sins for the honor of your name.

10. Why should the nations be allowed to say: Where is their God? Let us watch as the nations learn that there is punishment for shedding the blood of your servants.

11. Let the groans of prisoners come into your presence. With your powerful arm according to the greatness of your power rescue those who are condemned to death.

12. Pay each one of our neighbors back with seven times the number of insults they used to insult you, O Jehovah.

13. Your people, the flock in your pasture, will thank you forever. We will praise you throughout all generations.

## Psalms 80

__Of Asaph__

1. Oh, give ear listen, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock; you who are enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth!

2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your power and come to save us!

3. O God, restore us and cause your face to shine smile on usshow us favor that we will be saved.

4. O Jehovah God, commander of armies, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?

5. You made them eat tears as food. You often made them drink their own tears.

6. You made us a source of conflict to our neighbors. Our enemies make fun of us.

7. O God, commander of armies, restore us and smile on us so that we may be saved.

8. You brought a vine from Egypt. You forced out the nations and planted it.

9. You cleared the ground for it so that it took root and filled the land.

10. Its shade covered the mountains. Its branches covered the mighty cedars.

11. It reached out with its branches to the Mediterranean Sea. Its shoots reached the Euphrates River.

12. Why did you break down the stone fences around this vine? All who pass by are picking its fruit.

13. Wild boars from the forest graze on it. Wild animals devour it.

14. O God, commander of armies, come back! Look from heaven and see! Come to help this vine.

15. Take care of what your right hand planted, the son you strengthened for yourself.

16. The vine has been cut down and burned. Let them be destroyed by the threatening look on your face.

17. Let your power rest on the man you have chosen, the son of man you strengthened for yourself.

18. Then we will never turn away from you. Give us life again, and we will call on your name.

19. O Jehovah God, commander of armies, restore us, and cause your face to shine smile on us so that we may be saved.

## Psalms 81

__Of Asaph__

1. Sing for joy to God our strength. Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.

2. Sing a song and strike the tambourine. Play the sweet sounding lyre with the harp.

3. Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, and on our feast day.

4. For this is required by the law of Israel. It is an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

5. He established it for a testimony in Joseph Israel when he went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard a language that I did not understand. He said:

6. »I relieved his shoulder of the burden. His hands were freed from the basket.

7. »You called in trouble and I rescued you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah..

8. »Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you. O Israel, if you would listen to me!

9. »You must have no strange god among you. Do not worship any foreign god.

10. »I, Jehovah, am your God! I brought you up from the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.

11. »My people did not listen to my voice. Israel did not obey me.

12. »Therefore I gave them over to their stubborn hearts. They walked in their own counsel.

13. »Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!

14. »I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries.

15. »Those who hate Jehovah would pretend obedience submission to him. Their time of punishment would be long lasting.

16. »I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.«

## Psalms 82

__Of Asaph__

1. God stands in the congregation of the mighty. He pronounces judgment among the god-like ones: (John 10:35)

2. »How long are you going to judge unjustly? How long are you going to show partiality to the wicked?

3. »Defend the weak and fatherless. Protect the rights of the oppressed and the poor.

4. »Rescue the weak and needy. Help them escape the power of the wicked.«

5. Wicked people do not know or understand anything. As they walk around in the dark, all the foundations of the earth shake.

6. I said: »You are god-like ones. You are all sons of the Most High. (John 1:1)

7. »But you will certainly die like humans and fall like any prince.«

8. Arise, O God! Judge the earth, because all the nations belong to you.

## Psalms 83

1. O God, do not keep silent. Do not keep silent and do not be still, O God.

2. For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.

3. They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones.

4. They say: »Come and let us destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.«

5. For they have come to an agreement united in thought. They form an alliance against you.

6. The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;

7. Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

8. Assyria also is joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot.

9. Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon

10. Who perished at Endor and became as dung for the earth.

11. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna.

12. For they said: »Let us take possession Of God's pasturelands.«

13. My God, make them like tumbleweed, like chaff before the wind.

14. Like the fire that consumes the forest, the flame that sets the mountains on fire,

15. pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.

16. Fill their faces with confusion that they may seek your name, Jehovah.

17. Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish,

18. That they may know that you alone, whose name is Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth.

## Psalms 84

__Of Korah__

1. How lovely are your dwelling places, O Jehovah of Hosts!

2. How I want to be there! I long to be in Jehovahs temple. With my whole being I sing for joy to the living God.

3. Even small birds have built a nest, and the swallows have their own home. They keep their young near your altars O Jehovah my king and my God.

4. How happy blessed are those who live in your temple always singing praise to you.

5. How happy are those whose strength comes from you, who are eager to make the pilgrimage to Mount Zion.

6. As they pass through the dry valley of Baca, it becomes a place of springs; the autumn rain fills it with pools.

7. They grow stronger as they go and they will see the God of gods on Zion.

8. Hear my prayer, Lord Jehovah of Hosts. Listen, O God of Jacob!

9. Look at our shield, O God. Look with favor on the face of your anointed one.

10. One day in your courtyards is better than a thousand anywhere else. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For Jehovah God is a sun and shield. Jehovah will give favor and honor. He will not withhold blessing from those who walk faithfully in truth.

12. O Jehovah of Hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in you.

## Psalms 85

__Of Korah__

1. You favored your land, O Jehovah. You restored the prosperity of Jacob.

2. You removed your people's guilt. You pardoned all their sins.

3. You laid aside all your fury. You turned away from your burning anger.

4. Restore us, O God of our salvation. Put an end to your anger against us.

5. Will you be angry with us forever? Will you ever let go of your anger in the generations to come?

6. Will you not restore our lives again so that your people may find joy in you?

7. Show us your loving-kindness, O Jehovah. Grant us your salvation.

8. I want to hear what the Lord Jehovah says, because he promises peace to his people, to his godly ones. But they must not go back to their stupidity.

9. Indeed, his salvation is near those who reverence him, and his glory will remain in our land.

10. Mercy and truth have met. Righteousness and peace have kissed.

11. Truth springs from the ground, and righteousness will look down from heaven.

12. Jehovah will certainly give us what is good, and our land will produce crops.

13. Righteousness will go ahead of him and make a path for his steps.

## Psalms 86

__Prayer by David__

1. Listen to me, O Jehovah. Answer me, for I am oppressed and needy.

2. Protect me, for I am a godly man. You are my God. Save your servant who trusts you.

4. Give me joy, O Jehovah, and lift me up.

5. You, O Jehovah, are good and forgiving, full of loving kindness toward everyone who calls out to you.

6. Open your ears to my prayer, O Jehovah. Pay attention to my supplications!

7. When I am in trouble, I call out to you because you answer me.

8. No god is like you, O Jehovah. No one can do what you do.

9. All the nations that you have made will bow in your presence, Jehovah. They will honor glorify you.

10. Indeed, you are great, a worker of miracles. You alone are God.

11. Teach me your way, O Jehovah, so that I may live in your truth. Unite my heart to reverence you.

12. I will give thanks to you with all my heart, Jehovah my God. I will honor glorify you forever.

13. Your loving kindness toward me is great. You have rescued me from the depths of the grave.

14. O God, arrogant people attack me, and a mob of ruthless people seeks my life. They think nothing of you.

15. But you, O Jehovah, are a compassionate and merciful God. You are patient, always faithful and ready to forgive.

16. Turn toward me, have pity and be gracious to me. Give me your strength because I am your servant. Save me because I am the son of your female servant.

17. Grant me some proof of your goodness so that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame. You, O Jehovah, have helped me and comforted me.

## Psalms 87

__Of Korah__

1. His foundation is in the holy mountains.

2. Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.

3. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God.

4. I will mention Rahab defamatory word for Egypta boaster (Isaiah 30:7) and Babylon among those who know me. Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia: »This one was born there.«

5. But of Zion it shall be said: »This one and that one were born in her and the Most High will establish her.«

6. Jehovah will count when he registers the peoples: »This one was born there.«

7. Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes will say: »All my springs of joy are in you.«

## Psalms 88

__Sons of Korah__

1. O Jehovah, God of my salvation I cry out to you day and night.

2. Let my prayer come before your presence. Turn your ear to hear my cries.

3. I am filled with troubles, and my life comes closer to the grave.

4. I am numbered with those who go into the pit. I am like a man without any strength.

5. I am abandoned with the dead, like those who have been killed and lie in graves. I am like those whom you no longer remember, who are cut off from your hand powercare.

6. You have put me in the bottom of the pit, in deep dark places.

7. Your rage lies heavily on me. You afflict me with all your waves.

8. You have taken my friends far away from me. You made me disgusting to them. I am shut in, and I cannot get out.

9. My eyes grow weak because of my suffering. All day long I call out to you, O Jehovah. I stretch out my hands to you in prayer.

10. Will you perform miracles for those who are dead? Will the dead rise and give thanks to you?

11. Will anyone tell about your loving kindness in the grave or about your faithfulness after they parish?

12. Will anyone know about your miracles in that dark place or about your righteousness mercy in the place of destruction?

13. I cry out to you for help, O Jehovah, and in the morning my prayer will come before you.

14. Why do you reject me, O Jehovah? Why do you hide your face from me turn from me?

15. Ever since I was young, I have been suffering and near death. I have endured your terrors, and now I am in despair.

16. Your burning anger has swept over me. Your terrors have destroyed me.

17. They swirl around me all day long like water. They surround me on all sides.

18. You have taken my loved ones and friends far away from me. Darkness is my only friend!

## Psalms 89

__Psalm of Ethan the Ezrahite__

1. I will sing of the loving kindness of Jehovah forever. With my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.

2. For I have said: »Loving-kindness will be built up forever. You will establish your faithfulness in the heavens.«

3. »I made a covenant with my chosen; I swore to David my servant:

4. I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations.

5. The heavens will praise your wonders, O Jehovah, Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

6. For who in the heavens is comparable to Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like Jehovah?

7. He is a God greatly reverenced in the council of the holy ones. He is awesome above all those who are around Him?

8. O Jehovah God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Jehovah? Your faithfulness also surrounds you.

9. You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.

10. You crushed Rahab like one who is slain. You scattered your enemies with your mighty arm power.

11. The heavens and the earth are yours. You have founded the world and all it contains.

12. The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at your name.

13. You have a strong arm! Your hand is mighty power by Holy Spirit; your right hand is exalted.

14. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before you.

15. How blessed are the people who know the joyful sound! O Jehovah, they walk in the light of your countenance.

16. They rejoice in your name all the day. They are exalted in your righteousness.

17. For you are the glory of their strength and by your favor our horn strength is exalted increased.

18. For our shield belongs to Jehovah, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.

19. Once you spoke in vision to your godly ones. You said: »I have given help to one who is mighty. I have exalted one chosen from the people.«

20. I have found David my servant. I anointed him with my holy oil.

21. With him my hand will be established; my arm also will strengthen him.

22. No enemy will tax him. No wicked man will oppress him.

23. I will beat down his adversaries before him. I will strike those who hate him.

24. But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him. In my name, his horn powerstrength will be exalted increased.

25. I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.

26. He will call to me: »You are my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation!«

27. I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.

28. I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore. My covenant will stand firm with him.

29. I will make his descendants endure forever and his throne like the days of heaven.

30. If his descendants abandon my law and do not live by my rules,

31. if they violate my statutes and do not obey my commandments,

32. then with a rod I will punish their transgression and their crimes with beatings.

33. But I will not take my loving kindness away from him or allow my truth to become perverted.

34. I will not dishonor my promise or alter my own agreement.

35. On my holiness I have taken an oath: I will not lie to David.

36. His descendants will last forever. His throne will be in my presence like the sun.

37. It shall be established forever like the moon. It will be like a faithful witness in heaven.

38. But you have despised, rejected, and become angry with your anointed one.

39. You have refused to recognize the covenant to your servant and have thrown his crown into the dirt.

40. You have broken through all his walls and have laid his fortified cities in ruins.

41. Everyone who passed by robbed him. He has become the object of his neighbors' scorn.

42. You lifted up the right hand of his enemies and made all of his adversaries rejoice.

43. You even took his sword out of his hand and failed to support him in battle.

44. You put an end to his splendor and hurled his throne to the ground.

45. You cut short the days of his youth and covered him with shame.

46. How long, O Jehovah? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your anger continue to burn like fire?

47. Remember how short my life span is! Have you created the sons of men for no reason?

48. Can man go on living and never see death? Who can set himself free from the power of the grave?

49. Where is the evidence of your mercy, Lord? You swore an oath to David on the basis of your faithfulness.

50. Jehovah, remember the reproach of your servant. Remember how I have carried in my heart the insults from so many people.

51. Your enemies insulted me. They insulted your anointed every step he took.

52. Blessed be Jehovah forevermore! Amen and Amen.

## Psalms 90

__Prayer of Moses__

1. O Jehovah, you have been our refuge throughout every generation.

2. Before the mountains were born, before you gave birth to the earth and its inhabitants, you are God from everlasting to everlasting.

3. You turn men back into dust and say: »Return, O sons of men!«

4. In your sight a thousand years are like a single day, like yesterday, already past like an hour in the night.

5. You sweep mortals away in the sleep of death. They sprout again in the morning like grass.

6. In the morning they blossom and sprout. In the evening they fade and wither away.

7. Your anger consumes us. We are troubled by your rage.

8. You set our sins in front of you. You put our secret sins in the light of your presence.

9. Indeed, all our days slip away because of your fury. We live out our years like one long sigh.

10. The days of our lives are seventy or eighty years if we are in good health. But the best of them bring trouble and misery. Indeed, they are soon gone, and we fly away.

11. Who understands the power of your anger, and your fury according to the reverence that is due you?

12. Teach us to number each of our days so that we may present to you a heart of wisdom.

13. Return, O Jehovah! How long? Change your plans about us, your servants.

14. Satisfy us every morning with your loving kindness so that we may sing for joy and rejoice all our days.

15. Make us rejoice for as many days as you have made us suffer, for as many years as we have experienced evil.

6. plagues that roam the dark, epidemics that strike at noon.

8. You only have to look with your eyes to see the punishment of wicked people.

9. »You, O Jehovah, are my refuge!« You have made the Most High your home.

10. No harm will come to you. No sickness will come near your house.

11. He will put his angels in charge of you to protect you in all your ways.

12. They will carry you in their hands so that you never strike your foot against a rock.

13. You will step on lions and cobras. You will trample underfoot young lions and snakes.

14. Because you love me, I will rescue you. I will protect you because you know my name.

15. When you call to me, I will answer you. I will be with you when you are in trouble. I will deliver you and honor you.

16. I will satisfy you with a long life. I will show you my salvation.

## Psalms 92

1. It is good to give thanks to Jehovah, to sing praises to your name, O Most High.

2. It is good to declare your loving kindness in the morning and your faithfulness at night.

4. You made me find joy in what you have done, O Jehovah. I will sing joyfully about the works of your hands.

5. How great spectacularexcellent are your works, O Jehovah! How very deep are your thoughts!

7. Wicked people sprout like grass and all troublemakers flourish. Yet they will be destroyed forever.

8. But you, O Jehovah, are highly honored forever.

11. My eyes gloat over those who spy on me. My ears hear the evildoers attacking me.

12. Righteous people flourish like palm trees and grow tall like the cedars in Lebanon.

13. They are planted in Jehovahs house. They blossom in our God's courtyards.

14. Even when they are old, they still bear fruit. They are always healthy and fresh.

15. They make it known that Jehovah is upright. He is my rock. He is never unrighteous.

## Psalms 93

1. Jehovah reigns and he is clothed with majesty. Jehovah has girded himself with strength. The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.

2. Your throne is established from of old. You are from everlasting.

3. The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their pounding waves.

5. They crush your people, O Jehovah. They make those who belong to you suffer.

6. They kill widows and foreigners, and they murder orphans.

7. They say: Jehovah does not see it. The God of Jacob does not even pay attention to it.

8. Pay attention, you stupid senseless people! When will you become wise, you fools?

9. God created ears. Do you think he cannot hear? He formed eyes. Do you think he cannot see?

10. He disciplines nations. Do you think he cannot punish? He teaches people. Do you think he does not know anything?

11. Jehovah knows the thoughts of man. He knows that they a mere vanity.

16. Who will stand up for me against evildoers? Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness?

17. If Jehovah had not been my help, I would have been silent in death.

18. If I should say: My foot has slipped, your loving kindness, O Jehovah, will hold me up.

2. Wicked and deceitful people have opened their mouths against me. They speak against me with lying tongues.

3. They surround me with hateful words. They fight against me without reason.

4. In return for my love, they accuse me, but I pray for them.

5. They reward me with evil instead of good and with hatred instead of love.

6. Appoint the evil one to oppose him. Let an accuser stand at his right hand.

7. When he stands trial, let him be found guilty. Let his prayer be considered sinful.

8. Let his days be few in number. Let someone else take his place.

9. Let his children become fatherless and his wife a widow.

10. Let his children wander around and beg. Let them seek help far from their ruined homes.

11. Let a creditor take everything he owns. Let strangers steal what he has worked for.

12. Let no one be kind to him anymore. Let no one show any pity to his fatherless children.

13. Let his descendants be cut off and their family name be wiped out by the next generation.

14. Let Jehovah remember the guilt of his ancestors and not wipe out his mother's sin.

15. Let their guilt and sin always remain on record in front of Jehovah. Let Jehovah remove every memory of him from the earth,

16. for he did not remember to be kind. He drove oppressed, needy, and brokenhearted people to their graves.

17. He loved to put curses on others, so he, too, was cursed. He did not like to bless others, so he never received a blessing.

18. He wore cursing as though it were clothing; so cursing entered his body like water and his bones like oil.
