## John 1

__(Writer: Apostle John, means Jehovah Has Shown Favor) (98 C.E.) (Near Ephesus) (92% of this Gospel is new information not contained in the other three Gospels)__

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was like God God-like.

2. The same was in the beginning with God.

3. All things were made through him and without him not one thing was made.

4. He lived and his life gives light to all people.

5. His light shines through darkness and it cannot be extinguished.

6. God sent a man named John. (Malachi 3:1)

7. He came to tell witnesstestify about the light and help people have faith.

8. Not being the light he came to give a witness of it.

9. The true light, which gives light to every man, came into the world. (Isaiah 49:6)

10. The world was made through him. He was in the world and the world did not recognize him.

11. He came to his own. They did not receive him!

12. He gave the right to become children of God to all who received him. Even to those who believe in his name.

13. They were born from God. It was not from blood, or the will of the flesh, or the will of man.

14. The Word Jesus became flesh a human being and lived with us. We saw the glory of the only begotten son from the Father. He was full of loving-kindness and truth.

15. John spoke about him and declared: He is the one I said would come after me. He is greater than I am because he lived before me.«

16. Out of the fullness of his undeserved kindness he gives us one blessing after another.

17. The law came through Moses. Loving-kindness and truth came through Jesus Christ.

18. No man has ever seen God. The only begotten God-like one who is closest to the Father in the bosom of the Father tells us about him. (Psalm 8:5)

19. John gave his witness even as Jewish authorities sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked him: »Who are you?«

20. He said: »I am not the Christ.«

21. They asked him: »Are you Elijah?« He said: »I am not.« »Are you the prophet?« He answered: »No.«

22. They said to him: »Who are you? We need to know so we can tell the ones who sent us.«

23. He said: »I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Isaiah the prophet said: Make straight the way of Jehovah.« (Isaiah 40:3)

24. They were sent from the Pharisees.

25. They said to him: »Why do you baptize if you are not the Christ, not Elijah, and not the prophet?«

26. John answered: »I baptize in water. There is one in your midst whom you do not know.

27. »I am not worthy to fasten his shoes.«

28. These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29. The next day he saw Jesus coming to him. He boldly declared: »Behold! The Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!«

30. »This is he whom I said would come after me. He is greater than I am because he came before me.

31. »I did not know him. I came baptizing in water so that everyone in Israel will come to know him.«

32. John said: »I saw the spirit descending as a dove out of heaven upon him.

33. »I did not know he was the one. God sent me to baptize in water and said: You will see one upon whom the spirit descends. The same is he who baptizes in Holy Spirit.

34. »I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.«

35. The next day John was standing with two of his disciples.

36. He looked at Jesus as he walked, and said: »Behold, the Lamb of God!«

37. The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus.

38. Jesus turned and saw them following. He asked them, »What are you after? They asked him: »Teacher, where are you staying?«

39. He said« »Come and see.« So they came to where he was staying. They stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.

40. One of the two, who heard John speak and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother.

41. He found his brother Simon first. He said to him: »We have found the Messiah Christ.«

42. He took him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said: »You are Simon the son of John: you will be called Cephas meaning: Peter.«

43. The next day he was reminded to go into Galilee. There he found Philip. Jesus said to him, »Follow me.«

44. Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him: »We have found the person Moses and the prophets wrote about in the Law and Gods word. It is Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.«

46. And Nathanael said to him: »Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?« Philip said: »Come and see.«

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said: »Look an Israelite indeed. There is no deceit in him!«

48. Nathanael asked: »How do you know me?« Jesus answered: »I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.«

49. Nathanael answered: »Rabbi you are the Son of God. You are King of Israel.«

50. Jesus responded: »I told you I saw you under the fig tree. Is this why you believe? You will see greater things than these.«

51. Jesus continued: »You will see the heavens opened and you will see the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.«

## John 2

1. There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee on the third day. The mother of Jesus was there.

2. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.

3. They ran out of wine. So the mother of Jesus said to him: »They have no wine.«

4. Jesus said to her: »Woman what have I to do with you? My hour has not arrived.«

5. His mother told the servants to do whatever he says.

6. Six stone water jars were placed there to honor purification rules of the Jews. Each contained more than twenty gallons.

7. Jesus said to them: »Fill the jars with water.« They filled them to the brim.

8. »Draw some out,« he said, »and take it to the master of the feast.« So they drew some out.

9. The master of the feast did not know about the water turned into wine. He tasted it and called the bridegroom.

10. He said to him: »Every man sets out the good wine first. When the men have drunk freely the lower quality wine is served. You have kept the good wine until now.«

11. This was the first miracle Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. It gave evidence of his glory and his disciples believed in him.

12. He, his mother, brothers and disciples traveled to Capernaum. They stayed there many days.

13. The Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went to Jerusalem.

14. He found the merchants who sold oxen, sheep and doves. The moneychangers were sitting nearby.

15. He made a whip of cords, and chased them all out of the temple, including the sheep and the oxen. He poured out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned the tables.

16. He told those who sold doves: »Take these things away. Do not make my Fathers house a house of merchandise.«

17. His disciples remembered what was written. Zeal for your house shall eat me up. (Psalm 69:9)

18. The Jews asked him: »What sign would you show us seeing that you do these things?

19. Jesus replied: »Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.«

20. The Jews responded: »It took forty-six years to build this temple and you will raise it up in three days?«

21. But he spoke of the temple of his body.

22. When he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus said.

23. When he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many saw the signs he did and expressed active faith in his name.

24. Jesus did not trust his security to them for he understood all men.

25. He did not need evidence about men for he knew what was in man.

## John 3

1. Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

2. He came to Jesus by night, and said to him: »Rabbi! We know you are a teacher from God. No one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.«

3. Jesus answered: »Truly I tell you unless a person is born again brought forth from above he cannot see the kingdom of God.«

4. Nicodemus asked: »How could a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mothers womb again and be born?«

5. Jesus responded: »I tell you truth, except a man be born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!

6. »That which is born from the flesh is flesh and that which is born from the Spirit is spirit.

7. »Do not marvel that I say you must be born again.

8. »The wind blows where it will. You hear the sound of it. Yet you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. It is like this with every one who is born from the Spirit.«

9. Nicodemus asked: »How can these things be?«

10. Jesus answered: »Are you a teacher of Israel and you do not understand these things?

11. »This is the truth. We speak what we know and witness about what we have seen. But you do not receive our testimony.

12. »If I told you earthly things and you did not have faith, how will you have faith if I tell you heavenly things?

13. »No one has ever ascended into heaven but the Son of man who descended from heaven.

14. »As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must also be lifted up.

15. »Everyone who has an active faith in him may have everlasting life.

16. »For God loved the world so much, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever has an active faith in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

17. »God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world. Instead the world should be saved through him.

18. »He who has an active faith in him is not judged. He who does not have an active faith has been judged already for he has not had faith in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19. »This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world. People loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil.

20. »Every one who does evil hates the light. He does not come to the light because his works would be reproved.

21. »He who practices the truth comes to the light. His works are made known that they are from God.«

22. After these things Jesus and his disciples traveled to the land of Judea where he stayed with them and baptized.

23. John was also baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there. People came and were baptized.

24. John had not yet been thrown into prison.

25. There was a controversy between some of Johns disciples and the Jews about purification.

26. They went to John and said: »Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, the one about whom you witnessed, he and the men with him baptize.«

27. John answered: »A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven.

28. »You bear witness that I said I am not the Christ. I have been sent before him.

29. »He that has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens to him. He rejoices greatly because he hears the bridegrooms voice. This fills me with joy.

30. »He must increase and I must decrease.«

31. »He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from an earthly viewpoint. He who comes from heaven is superior.

32. »He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no man accepts his testimony.

33. »He who receives his testimony confirms by his seal that God is true.

34. »For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God. God does not give the spirit by measure.

35. »The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.

36. »He who puts active faith in the Son has everlasting life. He who disobeys* the Son will not see life for the wrath of God remains upon him.« *Greek: apeitheo: willfully disobey, not having faith

## John 4

1. The Lord was aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John.

2. Actually Jesus did not baptize. His disciples baptized.

3. He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.

4. He needed to travel through Samaria.

5. He arrived at a city of Samaria called Sychar. It is near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. Jacobs well was there. It was about the sixth hour when Jesus arrived. Being weary from the journey he sat down by the well.

7. A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: »Please give me a drink.«

8. His disciples went away to the city to buy meat.

9. The woman of Samaria asked: »How is it that you being a Jew ask for a drink from me? I am a woman of Samaria.« The Jews did not associate with Samaritans.Not in early manuscripts.

10. Jesus answered: »If you know the gift of God and who asked you for a drink, you would have asked him to give you living water.«

11. The woman said to him: »Sir, you do not have anything with which to draw water and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?

12. »Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well. He and his children and cattle drank from it.«

13. Jesus answered: »Whoever drinks from this water will thirst again.

14. »But whoever drinks from the water that I give him will never thirst. The water that I will give him will be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.«

15. The woman said to him: »Sir, give me this water! That way I will not thirst and not come here to draw.«

16. Jesus said to her: »Go call your husband and come here.«

17. The woman answered: »I have no husband.« Jesus replied to her: »You said well, »I have no husband.«

18. »For you have had five husbands. The one you have now is not your husband, this is true.«

19. The woman said to him: »Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.

20. »Our fathers worshipped in this mountain. But you say Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.«

21. Jesus replied: »Woman believe me. The hour comes when you will worship the Father neither in the mountain nor in Jerusalem.

22. »You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know. Salvation is from the Jews.

23. »But the hour comes and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father with spirit and truth. The Father seeks such people to worship him.

24. »God is a Spirit. They who worship him must worship him with spirit and truth.«

25. The woman responded: »I know that Christ the Messiah is coming. When he comes he will tell us all things.«

26. Jesus said: »I that speak to you am he.«

27. His disciples came and wondered why he talked with the woman. Yet no one asked: »What are you looking for? Why did you talk to her?«

28. The woman left her water pot and went to the city. She spoke to the men.

29. »Come see a man who told me everything I have ever done. Could this be the Christ?«

30. They left the city to see him.

31. In the meantime his disciples urged him to eat.

32. He said: »I have food to eat that you do not know about.«

33. So the disciples said to each other: »Has any man brought him something to eat?«

34. Jesus said: »My food is to do the will of him that sent me. To finish his work!

35. »Do you say there are four months until the harvest comes? I say to you lift up your eyes and look on the fields. They are already white for harvest.

36. »He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal. Both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.

37. »That saying is true. One sows and another reaps.

38. »I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Other men labored and you entered into their labors.«

39. Many Samaritans of that city put faith believed in him because of what the woman said: »He told me everything I have ever done.«

40. When the Samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with them. So he stayed there two days.

41. Many more believed because of the words he spoke.

42. They told the woman: »We believe because of what you said and we heard him ourselves. We know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world!«

43. After two days he departed from there and went to Galilee.

44. Jesus testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.

45. The Galileans welcomed him. They saw all the things he did at the feast in Jerusalem for they were at the feast.

46. Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee where he turned the water into wine. There was a nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.

47. He heard that Jesus came from Judea into Galilee. He went to him and urged him to come see his son. His son was near death.

48. »Until you see signs and wonders you will not believe,« Jesus said.

49. The nobleman said: »Sir, come or my child would die.«

50. Jesus replied: »Go your way. Your son lives!« The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.

51. His servants met him as he returned and said: »Your son is alive!«

52. He asked them about the hour he was healed. They said: »Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.«

53. The father knew that it was the same hour in which Jesus said: »Your son lives.« He and his entire household believed.

54. This is the second miracle that Jesus did when he came out of Judea into Galilee.

## John 5

1. After this the Jews had a Festival holy day, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2. There is a pool by the sheep-market gate at Jerusalem. It is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethzatha. It has five porches colonnades.

3. In these lay a great crowd of sick people, of blind and lame waiting for the water to bubble up.

4. Not in older manuscripts.

5. A man who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years was present.

6. Jesus saw him lying there. He knew that he had been sick for a long time. So he asked him: »Do you want to get well?«

7. The sick man replied: »I have no man to put me in the pool when the water is stirred. Others step down before I can go.«

8. Jesus said: »Arise pick up your bed and walk.«

9. Immediately the man was made whole. He picked up his bed and walked. It happened on the Sabbath day.

10. So the Jews told the man who was cured: »It is not lawful for you to pickup your bed for it is the Sabbath.«

11. He answered: »He who made me whole told me to pick up my bed and walk.«

12. »Who is the man,« they asked, »that said to you pick up your bed and walk?«

13. He did not know who healed him for Jesus quietly left the crowd.

14. Later Jesus found him in the temple and told him: »Now that you are healed do not sin anymore and avoid worse things happening to you.«

15. The man went away and told the Jews Jesus made him whole.

16. The Jews persecuted Jesus because he did these things on the Sabbath.

17. Jesus responded to them: »My Father works until now and I work.«

18. The Jews intensified their efforts to kill him for these reasons: he broke the Sabbath and he also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.

19. Jesus answered them: »Truly I tell you the Son can do nothing by himself. He sees the Father do something and then he does it. Whatever the Father does the Son does in like manner.

20. »The Father loves the Son. He shows him all of the things he does. He will show him greater works than these. And you will marvel.

21. »The Father raises the dead and gives them life. The Son also gives life to those he wills.

22. »The Father does not judge any man for he has given all judgment to the Son.

23. »All may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father that sent him.

24. »Truly, Truly I say to you, he who hears my word, and believes him that sent me, has everlasting life. He will not receive judgment for he has passed out of death into life.

25. »Truly I tell you, the hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear listenunderstand will live.

26. »The Son has life in himself just as the Father has life in himself. For the Father gave him life.

27. »And he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.

28. »Do not wonder about this for the hour is coming when everyone in the grave will hear his voice.

29. »They will return. Those who did good will have the resurrection of life. Those who did evil will receive the resurrection of judgment.

30. »I can do nothing by myself. So I hear and judge and my judgment is righteous. I do not seek my own will, but the will of him that sent me.

31. »If I alone testify about myself, my testimony is not enough truth.

32. »There is another who testifies about me. I know that his evidence about me is true.

33. »You sent people to John the Baptist and he has witnessed about the truth.

34. »The testimony I receive is not from man. However I say these things that you may be saved.

35. »He was the lamp that burns and shines. You were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.

36. »The testimony I have is greater than that of John. The works I do are the works the Father gave me to accomplish. They testify that the Father has sent me.

37. »The Father who sent me testifies about me. You have not heard his voice nor seen him at any time.

38. »You do not have his word dwelling in you. This is because you do not believe in the person he has sent.

39. »You search investigatestudy the Scriptures because you think that in them you have everlasting life. These Scriptures testify about me.

40. »And yet you will not come to me that you may have life.

41. »I do not accept glory from men.

42. »I know that the love of God is not in you.

43. »I came in my Fathers name and you did not receive me. If another came in his own name you would receive him.

44. »How can you believe? You seek praise and glory from one another? Why do you not seek the glory that comes from the only God?

45. »Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Moses on whom you have set your hope is a plaintiff against you.

46. »It is a fact! If you believed Moses you would believe me. He wrote about me!

47. »If you do not believe his writings how will you believe my words?«

## John 6

1. After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.

2. A great crowd followed him because they saw the signs miracles he performed on the sick.

3. Jesus and his disciples went to the mountain.

4. It was time for the Passover feast of the Jews.

5. Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him. He asked Philip: »Where will we buy enough bread to feed them?«

6. He said this to test him for he knew what he would do.

7. Philip answered: »Two hundred shillings worth of bread is not sufficient for everyone to take a little.«

8. Andrew, Simon Peters brother, one of his disciples said:

9. »There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish. What are these among so many?«

10. Jesus said: »Make the people sit down.« There were about five thousand men who sat down on the grass.

11. Jesus gave thanks and then he distributed the loaves along with the fish to those sitting on the grass.

12. When they were filled he told the disciples to gather up the broken pieces left over so nothing would be wasted.

13. They gathered twelve baskets of leftovers after everyone had eaten.

14. When the people saw the miracle performed they said: »Truly this is the prophet who came into the world.«

15. Jesus knew that they were about to take him by force and make him king. So he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

16. That evening his disciples went to the sea.

17. They boarded a boat to travel over the sea to Capernaum. It was dark and Jesus had not yet come to them.

18. A great wind made the sea rise.

19. They rowed about four miles and saw Jesus walking on the sea. He came close to the boat. They were afraid.

20. He said to them: »It is I. Do not be afraid!«

21. They eagerly brought him into the boat. The boat soon arrived at the land where they were going.

22. The next day the crowd stood by the side of the sea. Jesus entered the only boat while his disciples went away alone.

23. Small boats from Tiberias came there to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks.

24. When the crowd saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there they got into the boats and traveled to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

25. They found him on the other side of the sea and said: »Rabbi Teacher when did you come here?«

26. Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, you seek me not because you saw miracles but because you ate of the loaves and were full.

27. »Do not work for food that perishes but for food that offers everlasting life. The Son of man will give you this food. The Father, even God, has set his seal upon him.«

28. They asked: »What must we do, that we may work the works of God?«

29. Jesus answered: »This is the work of God, that you have an active faith in the one whom he has sent.«

30. They asked: »What do you offer for a sign miracle that we may see and believe you? What work will you do?

31. »Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness. It is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.«

32. Jesus responded: »I speak the truth! It was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven. My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.

33. »For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven. It gives life to the world.«

34. They responded: »Lord, always give us this bread.«

35. Jesus replied: »I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not hunger. The one who puts active faith in me will never thirst.

36. »I told you. You have seen me and yet do not believe.

37. »That which the Father gives me will come to me. I will not reject him who comes to me.

38. »I do not do my own will. I came down from heaven to do the will of him that sent me.

39. »This is the will of him that sent me that I should not lose any of those he has given me, but I should raise them up at the last day.

40. »For this is the will of my Father. Every one who sees the Son and puts active faith in him will have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.«

41. The Jews complained about him. This is because he said I am the bread that came down out of heaven.

42. They said: »Is Jesus the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How does he now say, I came down out of heaven?«

43. Jesus answered: »Stop complaining and saying things against me.

44. »No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him. I will resurrect him raise him up in the last day.

45. »It is written in the prophets: Jehovah shall teach them all. Every one who hears the Father and has learned comes to me. (Jeremiah 31:34)

46. »No one has seen the Father. Only he who is from God, He has seen the Father.

47. »Truly, truly I tell you, he who believes has everlasting life.

48. »I am the bread of life.

49. »Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.

50. »This is the bread that comes down out of heaven that a man may eat of it and not die.

51. »I am the living bread that came down out of heaven. If any man eats of this bread he will live forever. Yes and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.«

52. The Jews argued with one another saying: »How can this man give us his flesh to eat?«

53. Jesus responded to them: »Truly I tell you if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood you will not have life in yourselves.

54. »He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life! I will raise him up at the last day.

55. »For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

56. »He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides with me, and I with him.

57. »The living Father sent me and I live because of the Father. He who takes me for his food will live because of me.

58. »This is the bread that came down out of heaven. It is not like the bread manna the fathers ate and then died. He who eats this bread will live forever.«

59. He said these things in the synagogue when he taught in Capernaum.

60. When they heard this many of his disciples said: »This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?«

61. He knew his disciples complained about this. Jesus said: »Does this cause you to stumble?

62. »What if you see the Son of man ascending where he was before?

63. »It is the spirit that gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I spoke to you are spirit and life.

64. »There are some of you who do not believe.« Jesus knew from the beginning whom they were who did not believe and who would betray him.

65. He stated: »For this reason listen to what I say. No man can come to me, except it be given to him from the Father.«

66. After this many of his disciples returned to their old ways. They did not walk with him anymore.

67. Jesus asked the twelve: »Will you also go away?«

68. Simon Peter answered him: »Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of everlasting life!

69. »We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.«

70. Jesus replied: »Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil false accuserslandererdemon«.

71. He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot one of the twelve, for he would betray him.

## John 7

1. After that Jesus walked in Galilee. He would not walk in Judea because the Jews looked for ways to kill him.

2. It was time for the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles.

3. His brothers said to him: »Leave here and go to Judea. That way your disciples also may see the works that you do.

4. »No one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.«

5. For his brothers did not express active faith in him.

6. Then Jesus replied: »My time is not yet here but your time is always ready.

7. »The world has no reason to hate you. But it hates me because I testify that its works are evil.

8. »You go to this feast. I will not go to this feast for my time has not yet come.«

9. When he said these words to them he stayed in Galilee.

10. When his brothers left he secretly went to the feast.

11. The Jews looked for him at the feast and they said: »Where is he?«

12. There was much whispering among the people concerning him. Some said: »He is a good man.« Others said: »No, he deceives the people.«

13. However no man spoke openly about him out of fear of the Jews.

14. Midway through the feast Jesus went to the temple and taught.

15. The Jews wondered saying: »How does this man know letters? He has had no formal education.«

16. Jesus replied: »My teaching is not my own. It is his who sent me.

17. »If any man does his will he shall know the teachings. He will know if it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.

18. »He who speaks from his own authority seeks his own glory. He who seeks glory for the one who sent him is true. Unrighteousness is not found in him.

19. »Did Moses give you the law? / Yet none of you obey the law! Why do you seek to kill me?«

20. The crowd answered: »You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?«

21. Jesus responded: »I did one work and you all marveled because of it.

22. »Moses gave you circumcision. Not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers. And you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.

23. »A man receives circumcision on the Sabbath. That way the Law of Moses may not be broken. Are you angry with me, because I made an entire man whole on the Sabbath?

24. »Do not judge according to appearance! Judge a righteous judgment.«

25. Some in Jerusalem asked: »Is this he whom they seek to kill?

26. »He spoke openly and they said nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?

27. »How is it we know where this man is from but when the Christ comes no one will know where he is from?«

28. Jesus shouted in the temple: »You know me and from where I came. I did not come on my own. He who sent me is true and you do not know him.

29. »I know him because I am from him and he sent me.«

30. They looked for a way to capture him. But no man laid his hand on him. This is because his hour had not yet arrived.

31. Many in the crowd believed in him. They asked: »When the Christ comes will he do more signs than those this man has done?«

32. The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things concerning him. The chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to capture him.

33. Jesus therefore said: »I am with you a little while. Then I go to him who sent me.

34. »You will seek me and will not find me. You cannot come where I am going.«

35. The Jews said among themselves: »Where will this man go that we shall not find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

36. »What is this word that he said: You will seek me, and will not find me; and you cannot come where I am going?«

37. On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and shouted in a loud voice: »If any man thirst let him come to me and drink.

38. »Rivers of living water will flow from the innermost being of the man who believes in me. This is according to the scriptures.«

39. He spoke this by the Spirit. Those who believed in him were to receive the Spirit. The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.

40. When they heard these words some of the crowd proclaimed: »This truly is the prophet!

41. Others said: »This is the Christ.« But some asked: »Does the Christ come out of Galilee?

42. »Do the Scriptures say that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?«

43. So there arose a division in the crowd because of him.

44. Some of them wanted to apprehend him. Yet no man laid hands on him.

45. The chief priests and Pharisees asked the officers: »Why did you not bring him?«

46. »No man has ever spoken the way he speaks,« they replied.

47. The Pharisees therefore answered them: »Are you also deceived?

48. »Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?

49. »This crowd does not know the law. It is contemptible«

50. Nicodemus spoke to them. He is the Pharisee who earlier went to Jesus.

51. »Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to find out what he has done?«

52. They replied: »Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.«

53. Then each man went to his own house.questionable text
