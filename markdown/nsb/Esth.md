## Esther 1

__(Writer: Mordecai) (475 B.C.E.)__

1. Now it came about in the days of Ahasuerus, that Ahasuerus who was ruler of a hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom, from India as far as Ethiopia:

2. When King Ahasuerus was ruling in Shushan, his strong town,

3. In the third year of his rule he gave a feast to all his captains and his servants. The captains of the army of Persia and Media, the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom, were present before him.

4. For a long time, even a hundred and eighty days, he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honor that was his.

5. At the end of that time, the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in Shushan, the king's town, small as well as great, for seven days, in the outer square of the garden of the king's house.

6. There were hangings of white and green and blue, fixed with cords of purple and the best cotton linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone. The seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone.

7. They served drinks in gold vessels. Every vessel was different. The king freely gave wine from the kingdom.

8. The drinking was in keeping with the law. No one was forced: for the king gave orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man.

9. Vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of King Ahasuerus.

10. On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was glad with wine, he gave orders to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presences of King Ahasuerus.

11. That Vashti the queen was to come before him, with her royal crown, and let the people and the captains see her beauty: for she was very beautiful.

12. But when the servants gave her the king's order, Vashti the queen said she would not come. The king was very angry. His heart was burning with wrath.

13. The king spoke to the wise men that were experts with knowledge of the times. It was the king's practice.

14. The closest to the king were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media. They were friends of the king, and had the first places in the kingdom.

15. »By law, what is to be done to Vashti the queen? She has not done what King Ahasuerus ordered her to do.«

16. Before the king and the captains, Memucan gave his answer: »Vashti the queen has done wrong, not only to the king, but also to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of King Ahasuerus.

17. »For news of what the queen has done will come to the attention of all women. They will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them, King Ahasuerus gave orders for Vashti the queen to come before him and she did not come.

18. »The wives of the captains of Persia and Media, hearing what the queen has done, will say the same to all the king's captains. So there will be much shame and anger.

19. »If it is pleasing to the king, let an order go out from him. Let it be recorded among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it may never be changed. That Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place to another who is better than she.

20. »When the kings order is made public through all his great kingdom all the wives will give honor to their husbands, great as well as small.«

21. This suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains. The king did as Memucan said.

22. He sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom where their language is used. The letter said that every man was to be the ruler in his house, and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people.

## Esther 2

1. When the king's rage subsided, the thought of Vashti and what she had done and the order he had made against her came back to his mind.

2. Then the servants who were waiting on the king said to him, »Let a search be made for some fair young virgins for the king.

3. »Let the king give authority to some men in all the divisions of his kingdom, to get together all the fair young virgins and send them to Shushan, the king's town. Send them to the women's house. This is under the care of Hegai, the king's servant, the keeper of the women. Let the things needed for making them clean be given to them.

4. »And let the girl who is pleasing to the king be queen in place of Vashti.« The king was pleased with this suggestion; and he did so.

5. There was a Jew in Shushan named Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite.

6. He had been taken away from Jerusalem among those who had been made prisoner with Jeconiah, king of Judah, when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken him away.

7. And he had been a father to Hadassah who is Esther, the daughter of his father's brother: for she had no father or mother. When her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his daughter. She was very beautiful.

8. When the order made by the king was made public a number of girls were placed in the care of Hegai in the king's house in Shushan. Esther was taken to the king's house and put in the care of Hegai, the keeper of the women.

9. He was pleased with the girl and was kind to her. He quickly provided her with cosmetics and food. He gave her seven choice servant girls who were to be hers from the king's house. He had her and her servant-girls moved to the best place in the women's part of the house.

10. Esther had not said what family or people she came from, for Mordecai gave her orders not to do so.

11. Every day Mordecai took his walk before the square of the women's house, to see how Esther was and what would be done to her.

12. Now every girl, when her turn came, had to go in to King Ahasuerus. After undergoing, for a space of twelve months, what was ordered by the law for the women for this was the time necessary for making them clean, that is, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for making women clean.

13. In this way the girl was presented to the king. Whatever she desired was given to her to take with her from the women's house into the house of the king.

14. In the evening she went, and in the morning she would return to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, one of the king's eunuchs who had the care of the king's wives. If the king had delight in her and sent for her by name she would go to him again.

15. When the time came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, his father's brother, whom Mordecai had taken as his daughter, to go in to the king, she made request for nothing but what Hegai, the king's servant and keeper of the women, had given her. And all who saw her looked on Esther kindly.

16. Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his rule.

17. Esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women. To his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins. So he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.

18. The king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants and Esther. He gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a release amnestyday of rest to the provinces, and gave wealth from his store.

19. When the virgins came together in the second house of the women, Mordecai took his seat in the gate of the king's house.

20. Esther had still said nothing of her family or her people, as Mordecai had given her orders. Esther did what Mordecai said, as when she was living with him.

21. In those days, while Mordecai was seated at the king's gate two of the king's servants, Bigthan and Teresh, keepers of the gate, being angry, looked for a chance to attack King Ahasuerus.

22. Mordecai had knowledge of their purpose and sent word of it to Esther the queen. Esther gave the news to the king in Mordecai's name.

23. It was investigated and found to be true. The two men were put to death by hanging on a tree: and it was recorded in the records before the king.

## Esther 3

1. The king ordered that Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, was lifted up and given a position of honor and a higher place than all the other captains who were with him.

2. All the king's servants who were in the king's house went down to the earth before Haman and gave him honor just as the king ordered. But Mordecai did not go down before him or give him honor.

3. Then the king's servants in the king's house said to Mordecai, »Why do you go against the king's order?«

4. Now when they repeatedly said this to him day after day and he gave no attention, they told Haman about it. To see if Mordecai's behavior would be overlooked: for he said to them that he was a Jew.

5. Haman saw that Mordecai did not go before him and give him honor. Haman was very angry.

6. But it was not enough for him to attack Mordecai only. They made clear to him who Mordecai's people were. So Haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the Jews, even Mordecai's people, through all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.

7. In the first month, the month Nissan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, from day to day and from month to month they went on looking for a sign given by Pur that is chance before Haman, till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar.

8. Haman said to King Ahasuerus, »There is a nation living here and there in small groups among the people in all the divisions of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of any other nation. They do not keep the king's laws. For this reason it is not right for the king to let them be.

9. »If it is the king's pleasure, let a statement ordering their destruction be put in writing. I will give to those responsible for the king's business, ten thousand talents of silver for the king's storehouse.«

10. The king took his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of the Jews.

11. The king said to Haman: »The money is yours, and the people, to do with them whatever seems right to you.«

12. Then on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king's scribes were summoned. They put in writing Haman's orders to all the king's captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people. It was to be for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the language which was theirs. It was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with the king's ring.

13. Runners delivered letters to every division of the kingdom. They ordered the death and destruction of all Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the same day, even the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar, and the taking of all their goods by force.

14. A copy of the writing, to be made public in every part of the kingdom, was sent out to all the peoples, so that they might be ready when that day came.

15. The runners went out quickly with the king's order. A public statement was made in Shushan. The king and Haman took wine together, but the town of Shushan was troubled.

## Esther 4

1. When Mordecai learned what had been done, he tore his clothes in anguish. Then he dressed in sackcloth, covered his head with ashes, and walked through the city, wailing loudly and bitterly,

2. until he came to the entrance of the palace. He did not go in because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside.

3. Throughout all the provinces, wherever the king's proclamation was made known, there was loud mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, wailed, and most of them put on sackcloth and lay in ashes.

4. Esther's women and her servants came and gave her word of it. The queens grief was great indeed. She sent robes for Mordecai, so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off; but he would not wear them.

5. Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs whom he had given her to wait on her. She gave him orders to go to Mordecai and see what this was and why it was.

6. So Hathach went out and saw Mordecai in the open square of the town before the king's gate.

7. Mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place. He told about the amount of money that Haman said he would put in the king's store for the destruction of the Jews.

8. He gave him the copy of the order that was given in Shushan for their destruction. He ordered him to let Esther see it, and to make it clear to her. To say to her that she was to go in to the king to request his mercy and make prayer for her people.

9. Hathach returned and gave Esther an account of what Mordecai said.

10. Then Esther sent Hathach to say to Mordecai:

11. »It is common knowledge among all the king's servants and the people of every part of the kingdom, that if anyone, man or woman, comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for, there is only one law for him, that he is to be put to death. Only those to whom the king's rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives. I have not been sent for to come before the king in the past thirty days.«

12. They conveyed this message to Mordecai.

13. Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther: »Do not have the idea that you in the king's house will be safe from the fate of all the Jews.

14. »If at this time you say nothing. Then help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place. But you and your father's family will come to destruction. Who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this?«

15. Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer:

16. »Go assemble all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me. Take no food or drink night or day for three days. My women and I will do the same. Then I will go in to the king even though it is against the law. If death is to be my fate, then let it come.«

17. So Mordecai went away and did everything that Esther said.

## Esther 5

1. Esther put on her queen's robes on the third day and took her place in the inner room of the king's house, facing the king's house. The king was seated on his high seat in the king's house, facing the doorway of the house.

2. When the king saw Esther the queen waiting in the inner room, looking kindly on her he put out the rod of gold in his hand to her. So Esther came near and put her fingers on top of the rod.

3. The king said: »What is your desire, Queen Esther, and what is your request? I will give it to you, even to the half of my kingdom.«

4. Esther answered him: »If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the feast I have made ready for him.«

5. Then the king said, »Let Haman come quickly, so that what Esther said may be done.« So the king and Haman went to the feast Esther prepared.

6. While they were drinking wine the king said to Esther: »What is your prayer? For it will be given to you. What is your request? For it will be done, even to the half of my kingdom.«

7. Esther answered: »My prayer and my request is this:

8. »If I have the king's approval, and if it is the king's pleasure to give me my prayer and do my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will make ready for them. Tomorrow I will do as the king has said.«

9. Then on that day Haman went out full of joy and glad in heart. When he saw Mordecai in the king's gate and he did not get to his feet or give any sign of fear before him, Haman was full of wrath against Mordecai.

10. But controlling himself, he went to his house; and he sent for his friends and Zeresh, his wife.

11. He gave them an account of the glories of his wealth. The number of children he had. He recalled the ways in which he had been honored by the king. How the king put him over the captains and servants of the king.

12. Haman continued: »Truly, Esther the queen let no man but myself come in to the feast she made ready for the king. Tomorrow again I am to be her guest with the king.

13. »But all this is nothing to me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew seated by the king's gate.«

14. Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him: »Let a pillar, fifty cubits high, be made ready for hanging him. In the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of Mordecai. Then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with a glad heart.« Haman was pleased with the suggestion, and he had the pillar made.

## Esther 6

1. That night the king was unable to get any sleep. He sent for the books of the records and had some one was read them to him.

2. It was recorded in the book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's servants, keepers of the gate who conspired to kill the king.

3. The king said: »What honor and reward have been given to Mordecai for this?« The servants waiting on the king said: »Nothing has been done for him.«

4. The king asked: »Who is in the outer room?« Haman came into the outer room to get the king's authority for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar that he made ready for him.

5. The king's servants said: »Haman is waiting in the outer room.« The king said: »Let him come in.«

6. So Haman came in. And the king said to him: »What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring?« Then the thought came into Haman's mind, whom, more than myself, would the king have pleasure in honoring?

7. Haman answered: »For the man whom the king has delight in honoring,

8. »Let them take the robes that the king generally puts on, and the horse on which the king goes, and the crown that is on his head:

9. »And let the robes and the horse be given to one of the king's most noble captains, so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honoring. Let him go on horseback through the streets of the town, with men crying out before him. So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring.«

10. Then the king said to Haman: »Go quickly, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who is seated at the king's gate. See that you do everything as you have said.«

11. Haman took the robes and the horse, and dressing Mordecai in the robes, he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town, crying out before him: »So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honoring.«

12. Mordecai came back to the king's gate. But Haman went quickly back to his house, sad and with his head covered.

13. And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all his friends an account of what took place. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, »If Mordecai, who is starting to get the better of you, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not be able to do anything against him, but you will certainly go down before him.«

14. While they were still talking, the king's servants came to take Haman to the feast that Esther made ready.

## Esther 7

1. The king and Haman came to dine with queen Esther.

2. The king said to Esther again on the second day, while they were drinking: »What is your petition, Queen Esther? For it will be given to you. What is your request? For it will be done, even to the half of my kingdom.«

3. Esther the queen, answered: »If I have your approval, O king, and if it is the king's pleasure, let my life be given to me in answer to my petition. My people at my request:

4. »For my people and I have been sold for slaughter and destruction. If we had been taken as men-servants and women-servants for a price, I would have said nothing, for our trouble is little in comparison with the king's loss.«

5. Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen: »Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart?«

6. Esther said: »Our hater and attacker is this evil Haman.« Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the queen.

7. The king in his anger got up from the feast and went into the garden. Haman got to his feet to plead to Esther the queen for his life. He saw that the king had already decided against him.

8. Then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking. Haman was stretched out on the seat where Esther was. Then the king said: »Is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house?« While the words were on the king's lips, they put a cloth over Haman's face.

9. Then Harbonah, one of the court officials waiting before the king, said: »See, the pillar fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who said a good word for the king, is still in its place near Haman's house.« Then the king said: »Put him to death by hanging him on it.«

10. So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he made for Mordecai. Then the king's rage subsided.

## Esther 8

1. That day the king gave all the estate of Haman, the hater of the Jews, to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had made clear what he was to her.

2. The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther put Mordecai over the family of Haman.

3. Then Esther again came before the king. She fell down at his feet and wept as she requested: that he would put a stop to the evil purposes of Haman the Agagite and the designs that he had made against the Jews.

4. Then the king extended the rod of gold to Esther and she stood before the king.

5. She said: »If it is the king's pleasure and if I have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing to him, then let letters be sent giving orders against those which Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, sent out for the destruction of the Jews in all divisions of the kingdom.

6. »For how can it be possible for me to see the evil that is to overtake my nation? How may I see the destruction of my people?«

7. Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew: »See now, I have given Esther the family of Haman, and he has come to his death by hanging, because he made an attack on the Jews.

8. »Send a letter about the Jews, writing whatever seems good to you, in the king's name, and stamp it with the king's ring: for a writing signed in the king's name and stamped with the king's ring may not be changed.«

9. Then at that time, on the twenty-third day of the third month, which is the month Sivan, the king's scribes were summoned. Everything ordered by Mordecai was put in writing and sent to the Jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the divisions of the kingdom from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven divisions, to every division in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing and their language.

10. The letters were sent in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with his ring, and they were taken by men on horseback, going on the quick-running horses used for the king's business, the offspring of his best horses:

11. In these letters the king gave authority to the Jews in every town to come together and make a fight for their lives. To send death and destruction on the power of any people in any part of the kingdom attacking them or their children or their women, and to take their goods from them by force.

12. On one day in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, that is, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar.

13. A copy of the writing, to be made public as an order in every division of the kingdom, was given out to all the peoples, so that the Jews might be ready when that day came to give punishment to their enemies.

14. So the men went out on the quick-running horses used on the king's business. They wasted no time and forced on by the king's order; and the order was given out in Shushan, the king's town.

15. Mordecai went out from before the king, dressed in king-like robes of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen. The entire town of Shushan gave loud cries of joy.

16. It was a time of happiness joy and honor for the Jews.

17. And in every part of the kingdom and in every town, wherever the king's letter and his order came, the Jews were glad with great joy. They had a feast and a good day. A large number of the people of the land became Jews: for the fear of the Jews had come on them.

## Esther 9

1. Now on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, when the time came for the king's order to be put into effect, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to rule over them the opposite occurred, and the Jews had rule over their enemies.

2. On that day, the Jews came together in their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, for the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against them. Everyone had to give way before them. All the people feared them.

3. And all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the king's business supported the Jews because the fear of Mordecai had come on them.

4. For Mordecai was great in the king's house. Word about him went out through every part of the kingdom: for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.

5. So the Jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction, and did to their enemies whatever they had a desire to do.

6. The Jews put to death five hundred men in Shushan.

7. They put to death Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,

8. Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,

9. Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha,

10. The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the hater of the Jews; but they put not a hand on any of their goods.

11. On that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king.

12. The king said to Esther the queen: »The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan, as well as the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the kingdom! Now what is your petition? For it will be given to you. What other request have you? And it will be done.«

13. Then Esther said: »If it is the king's pleasure, let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today, and let orders be given for the hanging of Haman's ten sons.«

14. The king said that this was to be done, and the order was given out in Shushan. The hanging of Haman's ten sons was carried out.

15. The Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan. They did not take their material goods.

16. The other Jews in every division of the kingdom came together, fighting for their lives, and got salvation from their enemies and put seventy-five thousand of them to death. They did not put a hand on their material goods.

17. This they did on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.

18. The Jews in Shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month. On the fifteenth day they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.

19. So the Jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day, a day for sending offerings one to another.

20. Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, near and far.

21. He ordered them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same month, every year.

22. As days on which the Jews had rest from their haters, and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy, and from weeping to a good day: and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy, of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor.

23. The Jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing.

24. Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of all the Jews, conspired for their destruction, attempting to get a decision by Pur that is, chance with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off.

25. But when the business was put before the king, he gave orders by letters that the evil design that he had made against the Jews was to be turned against him. That he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging.

26. So these days were named Purim, after the name of Pur. And so, because of the words of this letter, and of what they had seen in connection with this business, and what had come to them,

27. The Jews made a rule and established a custom that all their descendents should observe two days every year as ordered in the letter, at the fixed time every year.

28. Those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family, in every division of the kingdom and every town, that there might never be a time when these days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews, or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their descendents.

29. Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the Purim.

30. He sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with true words of peace,

31. Giving the force of law to these days of Purim at their fixed times, as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen. This was in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their descendents, in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help.

32. The order given by Esther gave the force of law to the rules about the Purim. It was recorded in the book.

## Esther 10

1. King Ahasuerus put a tax on the land and on the islands of the sea.

2. And all his acts of power and his great strength and the full story of the high place that the king gave Mordecai are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Media and Persia?

3. For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus. He was great among the Jews and respected by the body of his countrymen. He worked for the good of his people. He said words of peace to all his descendents.
