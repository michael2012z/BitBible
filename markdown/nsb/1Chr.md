18. So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate. They took it to David. Nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.

19. He said: »Far be it from me, O my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have placed their lives in jeopardy? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.« Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.

20. Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men. He killed them and won a name among these three.

21. Of the three he was more honored than the other two men. Therefore he became their captain. However he did not attain to the first three.

22. Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.

23. And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great height, seven and a half feet tall. Egyptian had a spear like a weavers beam in his hand. He went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and killed him with his own spear.

24. These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty men.

13. He did not take the Ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.

14. The Ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months. Jehovah blessed his household and everything he had.

## 1 Chronicles 14

1. Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David. He also sent cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him.

2. David knew that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.

3. In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters.

4. These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

5. Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,

6. Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,

7. Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.

8. The Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel. So they went up in full force to search for him. David heard about it and went out to meet them.

9. The Philistines raided the Valley of Rephaim.

10. David inquired of God: »Should I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?« Jehovah answered him: »Go, I will hand them over to you.«

11. David and his men went to Baal Perazim. He defeated them there. He said: »As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.« So that place was called Baal Perazim the lord who breaks out.

12. The Philistines abandoned their gods. So David gave orders to burn them in the fire.

13. Once more the Philistines raided the valley.

14. David inquired of God again, and God answered him: »Do not go straight up, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.

15. »As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle. That will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.«

16. David did as God commanded him. They struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.

17. Thus Davids fame spread throughout every land. Jehovah made all the nations fear him.

## 1 Chronicles 15

1. David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David. Then he prepared a place for Gods Ark and pitched a tent for it.

2. David insisted that only the Levites carry Gods Ark because Jehovah had chosen them to carry his Ark and to serve him from generation to generation.

3. David called together all Israel at Jerusalem to bring Jehovahs Ark to the place he had prepared for it.

4. David also called together Aarons descendants and the Levites.

5. Leading Kohaths descendants were Uriel, who came with one hundred and twenty of his relatives.

6. Leading Meraris descendants were Asaiah, who came with two hundred and twenty of his relatives.

7. Leading Gershoms descendants were Joel, who came with one hundred and thirty of his relatives.

8. Leading Elizaphans descendants were Shemaiah, who came with two hundred of his relatives.

9. Leading Hebrons descendants were Eliel, who came with eighty of his relatives.

10. Leading Uzziels descendants were Amminadab, who came with one hundred and twelve of his relatives.

11. David called for the priests Zadok and Abiathar and for the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.

12. He said to them: »You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your brothers must perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy. Then bring the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to the place I prepared for it.

13. »Because you Levites were not there the first time, Jehovah our God struck us. We had not dedicated our lives to serving him in the way he designated.«

14. So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy in order to move the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.

15. The Levites carried Gods Ark on their shoulders. They used poles as Moses had commanded according to Jehovahs instructions.

16. David told the Levite leaders to appoint some of their brothers to serve as musicians. They were expected to play music on harps, lyres, and cymbals to produce joyful music for singing.

17. So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel, and from his relatives they appointed Asaph Berechiahs son. From their own relatives, Meraris descendants, they appointed Ethan son of Kushaiah.

18. In addition, they appointed their relatives from the second division: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah. Obed Edom and Jeiel were appointed gatekeepers.

19. The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to play bronze cymbals.

20. Zechariah, Jaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were appointed to play harps tuned according to alamoth.

21. Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were appointed to play lyres and to conduct the eighth.

22. Chenaniah, a Levite leader, instructed others how to sing prophetic songs because he was skilled at it.

23. Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.

24. The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer blew trumpets in front of Gods Ark. Obed Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

25. Thus David, the leaders of Israel, and the armys commanders joyfully went to get the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant from Obed Edoms house.

26. Because God helped the Levites who carried the Ark of the Jehovahs Covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.

27. David was dressed in a fine linen robe, as were all the Levites who carried the Ark, the Levites who were singers, and Chenaniah, the leader of the musicians prophetic songs. David also wore a linen ephod.

28. All Israel brought the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant with shouts of joy and the sounding of rams horns, trumpets, cymbals, harps, and lyres.

29. When the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant came to the City of David, Sauls daughter Michal looked out of a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, so she despised him.

## 1 Chronicles 16

1. The men carrying the ark set it inside the tent David had put up for it. They presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in Gods presence.

2. When David finished sacrificing burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.

3. He also distributed to every person in Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.

4. David appointed some Levites to serve in front of Jehovahs Ark by offering prayers, thanks, and praise to Jehovah the God of Israel.

5. Asaph was the head. Zechariah was second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel with harps and lyres. Asaph played the cymbals.

6. The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel played trumpets all the time in front of the Ark of Gods covenant.

7. For the first time David entrusted Asaph and his relatives with the task of singing songs of thanks to Jehovah:

8. Give thanks to Jehovah. Call on his name. Make known among the nations what he has done.

9. Sing to him. Make music to praise him. Meditate on all the miracles he has done.

10. Praise his holy name. Let the hearts of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.

11. Search for Jehovah and his strength. Always seek his presence.

12. Remember the miracles he performed. And remember the amazing things he did and the judgments he pronounced.

13. You are descendants of Israel, his servant. You are descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.

14. HE IS JEHOVAH OUR GOD. His judgments are pronounced throughout the earth.

15. Remember his promise for a very long time, the word that he commanded for a thousand generations!

16. Remember the covenant that he made to Abraham, and his sworn promise to Isaac.

17. He confirmed it as a law for Jacob, as a long lasting covenant to Israel.

18. He said: »I will give you Canaan. It is your share of the inheritance.«

19. While they were few in number a small group of foreigners lived in that land.

20. They wandered from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another.

21. He did not permit anyone to oppress them. He warned kings about them:

22. »Do not touch my anointed ones or harm my prophets.«

23. Sing to Jehovah, all the earth! Day after day announce that Jehovah saves his people.

24. Tell people about his glory! Tell all the nations about his miracles.

25. JEHOVAH IS GREAT! He should be highly praised. He should be reverenced held in awerespected more than all other gods.

26. This is because all the gods of the nations are useless idols while Jehovah created the heavens.

27. Splendor and majesty are in his presence. Strength and joy are where he is.

28. Appreciate Jehovahs glory and power you families of the nations. Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.

29. Ascribe to Jehovah the glory his name deserves. Bring an offering, and come to him. Worship Jehovah in his holy splendor.

30. Tremble in his presence, all the earth! The earth stands firm. It cannot be moved.

31. Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad. Say to the nations: »JEHOVAH RULES AS KING!«

32. Let the sea and everything in it roar like thunder. Let the fields and everything in them rejoice.

33. Then the trees in the forest will sing with joy in the presence of Jehovah when he comes to judge the earth.

34. Give thanks to Jehovah because he is good, because his mercy endures forever!

35. Say: »Rescue us, O God our Salvation. Gather us and save us from the nations that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.«

36. Thanks be to Jehovah, God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then all the people said »amen« and praised Jehovah.

37. David left Asaph and his relatives to serve continually in front of the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant, as the daily work required.

38. David also left Obed Edom and sixty-eight of his relatives to serve there. Obed Edom Jeduthuns son and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.

39. David left Zadok and his priestly relatives to serve in Jehovahs Tent at the place of worship in Gibeon.

40. They were ordered to sacrifice burnt offerings to Jehovah. This happened on the altar of burnt offerings continually, morning and evening, as written in the Law of Jehovah that he gave Israel.

41. With Zadok and his relatives were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of the Levites who had been selected. They were chosen by name, to give thanks to Jehovah by singing, because His mercy endures forever.

42. Also, Heman and Jeduthun played trumpets, cymbals, and the other musical instruments that accompany sacred songs. Jeduthuns sons were stationed at the gate.

43. Then all the people went home. David went back to bless his family.

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. David settled in his palace. He said to Nathan the prophet: »Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah is under a tent.«

2. Nathan replied to David: »Do what you have in mind, for God is with you.«

3. That night God spoke to Nathan. He said:

4. »Go tell my servant David, This is what Jehovah says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.

5. »I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.

6. »In all the places where I have moved with the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?«

7. Therefore, tell my servant David: »This is what Jehovah of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.

8. »I have been with you wherever you have gone. I have destroyed all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth.

9. »I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning.

10. »They have done this since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. I declare to you that Jehovah will build a house for you!

11. »When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you. It will be one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.

12. »He is the one who will build a house for me. I will establish his throne forever.

13. »I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.

14. »I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever! His throne will be established forever.«

15. Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.

16. Then King David went in and sat in Jehovahs presence. He said: »Who am I, O Jehovah? What is my family, that you have brought me this far?

17. »If this were not enough in your sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men, O Jehovah my God.

18. »What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant

19. »Jehovah. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.

20. »There is no one like you Jehovah and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.

21. »Who is like your people Israel? Israel is the one nation on earth whos God went out to redeem a people. You redeemed your people from Egypt. You make a name for yourself, and perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people.

22. »You made your people Israel your very own for a very long time, and you, O Jehovah, have become their God.

23. »Now, Jehovah, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established from generation to generation. Do as you promised!

24. »It will be established and your name will be great forever. Then men will say: »Jehovah of Hosts, the God over Israel, is Israels God! And the house of your servant David will be established before you.

25. »You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.

26. »O JEHOVAH, YOU ARE GOD! You have promised these good things to your servant.

27. »You have been pleased to bless the house of your servant that it may continue for a very long time in your sight. You Jehovah have blessed it and it will be blessed from generation to generation.«

## 1 Chronicles 18

1. After this, David defeated and crushed the Philistines. He captured Gath and its surrounding villages from them.

2. He also defeated Moab, and the Moabites became Davids subjects and paid taxes to him.

3. David went to establish his control over the territory along the Euphrates River. He defeated King Hadadezer at Hamath.

4. David took one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers from him. David also disabled all but one hundred of their horses so that they could not pull chariots.

5. When the Arameans from Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand of them.

6. David stationed troops in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus. The Arameans became his subjects and paid taxes to him. Everywhere David went Jehovah gave him victories.

7. David took the gold shields that Hadadezers servants carried. He brought them to Jerusalem.

8. David also took a large quantity of bronze from Tibhath and Cun, Hadadezers cities. Later Solomon used it to make the pool, pillars, and utensils for the temple.

9. When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Zobahs King Hadadezer,

10. he sent his son Hadoram to greet King David and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer. There had often been war between Hadadezer and Tou.

11. King David dedicated all the articles of gold, silver, and bronze to Jehovah, along with the silver and gold he had taken from other nations-from Edom, Moab, Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek.

12. Zeruiahs son Abishai killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Dead Sea region.

13. He put troops in Edom, and all its people became Davids subjects. Everywhere David went Jehovah gave him victories.

14. So David ruled all Israel. He did what was fair and right for all his people.

15. Zeruiahs son Joab was in charge of the army. Ahiluds son Jehoshaphat was the royal historian.

16. Ahitubs son Zadok and Abiathars son Abimelech were priests. Shavsha was the royal scribe.

17. Jehoiadas son Benaiah was commander of the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And Davids sons were his main officials.

## 1 Chronicles 19

1. In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king.

2. David thought: »I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.« So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. Davids men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him.

3. The Ammonite nobles said to Hanun: »Do you think David honors your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Or have his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?«

4. Therefore Hanun seized Davids men, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.

5. When David was told about the men he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said: »Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown and then come back.«

6. The Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in Davids nostrils. Then Hanun and the Ammonites sent seventy-five thousand pounds of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Northwest Mesopotamia Aram Maacah and Zobah.

7. They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.

8. David heard about this and sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.

9. The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.

10. Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.

11. He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.

12. Joab said: »If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me. But if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.

13. »Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. Jehovah will do what is good in his sight.«

14. Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.

15. When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.

16. The Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel. So they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezers army leading them.

17. David was told of this, so he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.

18. But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.

19. When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.

## 1 Chronicles 20

1. In the spring, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led the army to war. They destroyed the Ammonites and came to Rabbah to attack it, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down.

2. David took the gold crown from the head of Rabbahs king. It was placed on Davids head. The crown was found to weigh seventy-five pounds, and in it was a precious stone. David also took a lot of goods from the city.

3. He took the troops who were there and put them to work with saws, hoes, and axes. He did the same to all the Ammonite cities. After that David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.

4. War broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Sibbecai from Hushah killed Sippai, a descendant of Haraphah, and the Philistines were defeated.

5. When more fighting broke out with the Philistines, Elhanan, son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath from Gath. The shaft of Lahmis spear was like a beam used by weavers.

6. In another battle at Gath, there was a tall man who had twenty-four fingers and toes: six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He also was a descendant of Haraphah.

7. When he challenged Israel, Jonathan, son of Davids brother Shimea, killed him.

8. These men were the descendants of Haraphah from Gath. David and his men killed them.

## 1 Chronicles 21

1. Satan wanted to bring trouble on the people of Israel. He made David decide to take a census.

2. David gave orders to Joab and the other officers. He said: »Go through Israel, from one end of the country to the other, and count the people. I want to know how many there are.«

3. Joab answered: »May Jehovah make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now! They are all your servants, Your Majesty. Why do you want to do this and make the whole nation guilty?«

4. But the king made Joab obey the order. Joab traveled through the whole country of Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem.

5. He reported to King David the total number of men capable of military service. There were one million one hundred thousand in Israel and four hundred seventy thousand in Judah.

6. Because Joab disapproved of the kings command, he did not take any census of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin.

7. God was displeased with what had been done, so he punished Israel.

8. David said to God: »I have committed a terrible sin in doing this! Please forgive me. I have acted foolishly.«

9. Jehovah said to Gad, Davids prophet:

10. »Tell David that I am giving him three choices. I will do whichever he chooses.«

11. Gad went to David and told him what Jehovah said. He asked: »Which is it to be?

12. »Three years of famine? Three months of running away from the armies of your enemies? Or: three days in which Jehovah attacks you with his sword and sends an epidemic on your land. He will use his angel to bring death throughout Israel? What answer shall I give Jehovah?«

13. David replied to Gad: »I am in a desperate situation! But I do not want to be punished by the people. Let Jehovah be the one to punish me, because he is merciful.«

14. Therefore Jehovah sent an epidemic on the people of Israel, and seventy thousand of them died.

15. Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. Then he changed his mind. He said to the angel: »Stop! That is enough!« The angel was standing at the threshing place of Araunah, a Jebusite.

16. David saw the angel standing in midair, holding his sword in his hand, ready to destroy Jerusalem. Then David and the leaders of the people, all of whom were wearing sackcloth bowed low, with their faces touching the ground.

17. David prayed: »O God, I am the one who did wrong. I am the one who ordered the census. What have these poor people done? Jehovah, my God, punish my family, and me and spare your people.«

18. Jehovahs angel told Gad to command David to go and build an altar to Jehovah at Araunahs threshing place.

19. David obeyed Jehovahs command and did what Gad told him to do.

20. There at the threshing place Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat, and when they saw the angel, the sons ran and hid.

21. Araunah saw King David approaching. He left the threshing place and bowed low with his face touching the ground.

22. David said to him: »Sell me your threshing place so that I can build an altar to Jehovah, to stop the epidemic. I will give you the full price.«

23. »Take it, Your Majesty,« Araunah said, »and do whatever you wish. Here are these bulls to burn as an offering on the altar. Here are the threshing boards to use as fuel and wheat to give as an offering. I give it all to you.«

24. The king answered: »No, I will pay you the full price. I will not give as an offering to Jehovah something that belongs to you, something that costs me nothing.«

25. He paid Araunah six hundred gold coins for the threshing place.

26. David built an altar to Jehovah there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He prayed, and Jehovah answered him by sending fire from heaven to burn the sacrifices on the altar.

27. Jehovah told the angel to put his sword away, and the angel obeyed.

28. David saw by this that Jehovah answered his prayer. So he offered sacrifices on the altar at Araunahs threshing place.

29. Jehovahs tent that Moses made in the desert and the altar for burnt offerings were at the worship site at Gibeon.

30. David could not go there to consult God because the sword of Jehovahs angel frightened him.

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. David said: »The house of Jehovah God is to be here, and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel.«

2. So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners living in Israel. He appointed stonecutters from among them to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God.

3. He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more copper than could be weighed.

4. He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted. The Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.

5. David said: »My son Solomon is young and inexperienced. The house to be built for Jehovah should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it. So David made extensive preparations before his death.«

6. Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.

7. David said to Solomon: »My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of Jehovah my God.

8. »The word of Jehovah came to me, saying: You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my name. This is because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.

9. »You will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon peace, and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign.

10. »He is the one who will build a house for my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for a very ong time.«

11. »Now, my son, Jehovah is with you, and may you have success and build the house of Jehovah your God, as he said you would.

12. »May Jehovah give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of Jehovah your God.

13. »You will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that Jehovah gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.

14. »I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of Jehovah three thousand seven hundred and fifty tons of gold, about thirty-seven thousand five hundred tons of silver, quantities of copper and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them.

15. »You have many workmen: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as men skilled in every kind of work

16. in gold and silver, copper and iron, craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and Jehovah will be with you.«

17. David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.

18. He said to them: »Is not Jehovah your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me, and the land is subject to Jehovah and to his people.

19. »Devote your mind and heart to seek Jehovah your God. Begin to build the sanctuary of Jehovah God. That way you may bring the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah and the sacred articles belonging to God into the Temple that will be built for the name of Jehovah.«

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.

2. He also gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.

3. The Levites thirty years old or older were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand.

4. David said: Of these, twenty-four thousand are to supervise the work of Jehovahs Temple and six thousand are to be officials and judges.

5. Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise Jehovah with musical instruments I have provided for that purpose.

6. David divided the Levites into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.

7. Belonging to the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.

8. The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel, three in all.

9. The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran, three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.

10. The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei, four in all.

11. Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons so they were counted as one family with one assignment.

12. The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel, four in all.

13. The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants from generation to generation, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before Jehovah, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name as long as they live.

14. The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.

15. The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

16. The descendants of Gershom: Shubael was the first.

17. The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.

18. The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.

19. The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.

20. The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and Isshiah the second.

21. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

22. Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.

23. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth, three in all.

24. These were the descendants of Levi by their families, the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the Temple of Jehovah.

25. For David had said: »Since Jehovah, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem from generation to generation,

26. the Levites no longer need to carry the Tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service.«

27. According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.

28. The duty of the Levites was to help Aarons descendants in the service of the Temple of Jehovah: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the House of God.

29. They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.

30. They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah. They were to do the same in the evening

31. and whenever burnt offerings were presented to Jehovah on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts. They were to serve before Jehovah regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.

32. So the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the Temple of Jehovah.

## 1 Chronicles 24

1. The divisions of Aarons descendants were as follows: Aarons sons were Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

2. Nadab and Abihu died before their father died, and neither had any children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.

3. David, Eleazars descendant Zadok, and Ithamars descendant Ahimelech divided Aarons descendants into groups for service.

4. Since Eleazars descendants had more men who were family heads than Ithamars descendants, they were divided so that Eleazars descendants had sixteen family leaders and Ithamars descendants had eight family leaders.

5. Both groups were divided impartially by drawing lots so that there were officers for the holy place and officers for God among both Eleazars and Ithamars descendants.

6. The scribe Shemaiah was a son of Nethanel and a descendant of Levi. Shemaiah recorded their names in the presence of the king, the princes, the priest Zadok, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the family leaders of the priests and Levites. One family was chosen for Eleazar, another for Ithamar.

7. The first lot drawn was for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah,

8. the third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim,

9. the fifth for Malchiah, the sixth for Mijamin,

10. the seventh for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah,

17. the twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul,

18. the twenty-third for Delaiah, the twenty-fourth for Maaziah.

19. These were their priestly groups when they went to serve at Jehovahs temple. Their ancestor Aaron made these rules for them, as Jehovah God of Israel had commanded him.

20. The following men were leaders for Levis descendants from Kohath: Jehdeiah for Amrams descendants through Shubael,

21. Isshiah for Amrams descendants through Rehabiah,

22. Jahath for Izhars descendants through Shelomoth,

23. Jeriah for Hebrons descendants, Amariah the second of Hebrons descendants, Jahaziel the third of Hebrons descendants, Jekameam the fourth of Hebrons descendants,

24. Shamir for Uzziels descendants through Micah,

25. and Zechariah for Uzziels descendants through Micahs brother Isshiah.

26. The following men were leaders from Levis descendants from Merari: Mahli, Mushi, and Meraris son Jaaziah,

27. Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri for Meraris descendants through his son Jaaziah,

28. Eleazar who had no sons, for Mahlis descendants,

29. Jerahmeel for Mahlis descendants through Kish,

30. Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth for Mushis descendants. These were Levis descendants according to their families.

31. They drew lots as their relatives, Aarons descendants, had done. They drew them in front of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the leaders of the families of the priests and Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same way as those of the youngest.

## 1 Chronicles 25

2. King David stood there and said: »Listen to me relatives brothers and sisters and subjects. I had my heart set on building the Temple where the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant could be placed. This Temple will be a stool for our Gods feet, and I have made preparations to build it.«

3. »However God told me: You must not build the Temple for my name because you have fought wars and caused bloodshed.«

4. »Yet, from my entire family Jehovah God of Israel chose me to be king of Israel for as long as I live. He had chosen the tribe of Judah to lead Israel. From the families of Judah he chose my fathers family. From among my fathers sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.

5. »Of all my sons, for Jehovah has given me many sons, he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of Jehovahs kingdom to rule Israel.

6. »He told me: Your son Solomon will build my Temple and my courtyards because I have chosen him to be my son. I will be his father.

7. »I will establish his kingdom for a very long time if he will remain determined to obey my commands and laws, as he is doing today.«

8. »I order you in the sight of Israel, Jehovahs congregation. And as our God listens dedicate your lives to doing everything Jehovah your God has commanded. Then you will be able to possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance for your descendants.

9. »You my son Solomon, learn to know your fathers God. Serve Jehovah wholeheartedly and willingly because he searches every heart and understands every thought we have. If you dedicate your life to serving him, he will accept you. On the other hand if you abandon him, he will reject you from then on.

10. »So be careful, because Jehovah has chosen you to build the Temple as his holy place. Be strong, and do it.«

11. Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the entrance hall and the Temple, the storerooms, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the throne of mercy.

12. He gave him plans for the courtyards of Jehovahs Temple and for all the rooms around it. These rooms served as treasuries for Gods Temple and the gifts dedicated to God.

13. He determined the divisions of the priests and Levites. He planned all the work done for worship in Jehovahs Temple. He designed all the utensils for worship in Jehovahs Temple.

14. David specified the weight of gold to be used for each of the utensils for worship,

15. the weight of the gold lamp stands and their gold lamps that is, the weight of gold for each lamp stand and its lamps, the weight of silver for each silver lamp stand and its lamps according to the use of each lamp stand for worship,

17. the pure gold for the forks, bowls, and pitchers, the weight of each gold bowl, the weight of each silver bowl,

18. and the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave Solomon the plans for the chariot, that is, the gold angels with their wings spread to cover the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant.

19. David said: »All this was written for me by Jehovahs hand. He made all the details of the plan clear to me.«

20. David also told his son Solomon: Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do no be afraid or terrified. Jehovah God, my God, will be with you. He will not abandon you until all the work on Jehovahs Temple is finished.

21. Here are the divisions of the priests and Levites for every type of worship in Gods Temple. You have with you every skilled worker to do the work. In addition, all the leaders and people are at your command.

## 1 Chronicles 29

1. King David announced to the entire assembly: »God has chosen my son Solomon. He is however young and lacks experience. The work to be done is enormous, because this is not a palace for people but a Temple for Jehovah God.

2. »I have made every effort to prepare materials for the Temple: gold, silver, bronze, iron, timber, precious stones and gems, stones for mosaics, and quantities of marble.

3. »Over and above all this that I have provided, I have given silver and gold from my personal property because of my love for Gods Temple.

4. »I have given one hundred and fifteen tons of the finest gold and two hundred and sixty five tons of pure silver for decorating the walls of the Temple

5. and for all the objects which the skilled workers are to make. Now who else is willing to give a generous offering to Jehovah?«

6. Then the heads of the clans, the officials of the tribes, the commanders of the army, and the administrators of the royal property volunteered to give.

7. They gave the following for the work on the Temple: one hundred and ninety tons of gold, three hundred and eighty tons of silver, six hundred and seventy five tons of bronze, and three thousand seven hundred and fifty tons of iron.

8. Those who had precious stones gave them to the Temple treasury, which was administered by Jehiel of the Levite clan of Gershon.

9. The people gave willingly to Jehovah and were happy that so much had been given. King David also was extremely happy.

10. »There in front of the whole assembly King David praised Jehovah. He said: Jehovah, God of our father ancester Israel. May you be praised forever and ever!

11. »You are great and powerful, glorious, splendid, and majestic. Everything in heaven and earth is yours, and you, O Jehovah, are king, supreme ruler over all.

12. »All riches and wealth come from you. You rule everything by your strength and power. You are able to make anyone great and strong.

13. »Now, our God, we give you thanks, and we praise your glorious name.

14. »Yet my people and I cannot really give you anything. This is because everything is a gift from you, and we have only given back what is yours already.

15. »You know, O Jehovah that we pass through life like exiles and strangers, as our ancestors did. Our days are like a passing shadow, and we cannot escape death.

16. »O Jehovah, our God, we have brought together all this wealth to build a Temple to honor your holy name. It all came from you and all belongs to you.

17. »I well know, O my God, that you test everyones heart and are pleased with people of integrity. In honesty and sincerity I have willingly given all this to you. I have seen how your people who are gathered here have been happy to bring offerings to you.

18. »Jehovah, God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep such devotion always strong in your peoples hearts and keep them always faithful to you.

19. »Give my son Solomon a wholehearted desire to obey everything that you command and to build the Temple for which I have made these preparations.«

20. Then David commanded the people: Praise Jehovah your God! The entire assembly praised Jehovah, the God of their ancestors. They bowed low and gave honor to Jehovah and also to the king.

21. The following day they killed animals as sacrifices, dedicating them to Jehovah. Then they gave them to the people to eat. In addition, they sacrificed a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, which they burned whole on the altar. They also brought the offerings of wine.

22. That day they were very happy as they ate and drank in the presence of Jehovah. For a second time they proclaimed Solomon king. In the name of Jehovah they anointed him as their ruler and Zadok as priest.

23. So Solomon succeeded his father David on the throne Jehovah had established. He was a successful king, and the whole nation of Israel obeyed him.

24. All the officials and soldiers, and even all of Davids other sons, promised to be loyal to Solomon as king.

25. Jehovah made the whole nation stand in awe of Solomon. He made him more glorious than any other king that had ruled Israel.

26. David son of Jesse ruled over all Israel

27. for forty years. He ruled in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for thirty-three.

28. He died at a very old age, wealthy and respected, and his son Solomon succeeded him as king.

29. The history of King David from beginning to end is recorded in the records of the three prophets, Samuel, Nathan, and Gad.

30. The records tell how he ruled, how powerful he was, and all the things that happened to him, to Israel, and to the surrounding kingdoms.
