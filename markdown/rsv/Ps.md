## Psalms 1

__He beholds everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride."__

1. Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;

2. but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.

3. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.

4. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff which the wind drives away.

5. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;

6. for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

## Psalms 2

1. Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain?

2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and his anointed, saying,

3. "Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us."

4. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision.

5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,

6. "I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill."

7. I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my son, today I have begotten you.

8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.

9. You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."

10. Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.

11. Serve the LORD with fear, with trembling

12. kiss his feet, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way; for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

## Psalms 3

1. A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.

2. O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;

3. many are saying of me, there is no help for him in God. [Selah]

4. But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.

5. I cry aloud to the LORD, and he answers me from his holy hill. [Selah]

6. I lie down and sleep; I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.

7. I am not afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me round about.

8. Arise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! For thou dost smite all my enemies on the cheek, thou dost break the teeth of the wicked. [ (Psalms 3:9) Deliverance belongs to the LORD; thy blessing be upon thy people! [Selah] ]

## Psalms 4

1. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.

2. Answer me when I call, O God of my right! Thou hast given me room when I was in distress. Be gracious to me, and hear my prayer.

3. O men, how long shall my honor suffer shame? How long will you love vain words, and seek after lies? [Selah]

4. But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD hears when I call to him.

5. Be angry, but sin not; commune with your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. [Selah]

6. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.

7. There are many who say, "O that we might see some good! Lift up the light of thy countenance upon us, O LORD!"

## Psalms 5

1. To the choirmaster: for the flutes. A Psalm of David.

2. Give ear to my words, O LORD; give heed to my groaning.

3. Hearken to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to thee do I pray.

4. O LORD, in the morning thou dost hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for thee, and watch.

5. For thou art not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not sojourn with thee.

6. The boastful may not stand before thy eyes; thou hatest all evildoers.

7. Thou destroyest those who speak lies; the LORD abhors bloodthirsty and deceitful men.

8. But I through the abundance of thy steadfast love will enter thy house, I will worship toward thy holy temple in the fear of thee.

9. Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of my enemies; make thy way straight before me.

10. For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is destruction, their throat is an open sepulchre, they flatter with their tongue.

11. Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of their many transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against thee.

12. But let all who take refuge in thee rejoice, let them ever sing for joy; and do thou defend them, that those who love thy name may exult in thee. [ (Psalms 5:13) For thou dost bless the righteous, O LORD; thou dost cover him with favor as with a shield. ]

## Psalms 6

1. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments; according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David.

2. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, nor chasten me in thy wrath.

3. Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.

4. My soul also is sorely troubled. But thou, O LORD--how long?

5. Turn, O LORD, save my life; deliver me for the sake of thy steadfast love.

6. For in death there is no remembrance of thee; in Sheol who can give thee praise?

7. I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.

8. My eye wastes away because of grief, it grows weak because of all my foes.

9. Depart from me, all you workers of evil; for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.

10. The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD accepts my prayer. [ (Psalms 6:11) All my enemies shall be ashamed and sorely troubled; they shall turn back, and be put to shame in a moment. ]

## Psalms 7

1. A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush a Benjaminite.

2. O LORD my God, in thee do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me,

3. lest like a lion they rend me, dragging me away, with none to rescue.

4. O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,

5. if I have requited my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause,

6. let the enemy pursue me and overtake me, and let him trample my life to the ground, and lay my soul in the dust. [Selah]

7. Arise, O LORD, in thy anger, lift thyself up against the fury of my enemies; awake, O my God; thou hast appointed a judgment.

8. Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about thee; and over it take thy seat on high.

9. The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.

10. O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous, thou who triest the minds and hearts, thou righteous God.

11. My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.

12. God is a righteous judge, and a God who has indignation every day.

13. If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and strung his bow;

14. he has prepared his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.

15. Behold, the wicked man conceives evil, and is pregnant with mischief, and brings forth lies.

16. He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole which he has made.

17. His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own pate his violence descends. [ (Psalms 7:18) I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High. ]

## Psalms 8

1. To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of David.

2. O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is thy name in all the earth! Thou whose glory above the heavens is chanted

3. by the mouth of babes and infants, thou hast founded a bulwark because of thy foes, to still the enemy and the avenger.

4. When I look at thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast established;

5. what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou dost care for him?

6. Yet thou hast made him little less than God, and dost crown him with glory and honor.

7. Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet,

8. all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field,

9. the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the sea. [ (Psalms 8:10) O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is thy name in all the earth! ]

## Psalms 9

1. To the choirmaster: according to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.

2. I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will tell of all thy wonderful deeds.

3. I will be glad and exult in thee, I will sing praise to thy name, O Most High.

4. When my enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished before thee.

5. For thou hast maintained my just cause; thou hast sat on the throne giving righteous judgment.

6. Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.

7. The enemy have vanished in everlasting ruins; their cities thou hast rooted out; the very memory of them has perished.

8. But the LORD sits enthroned for ever, he has established his throne for judgment;

9. and he judges the world with righteousness, he judges the peoples with equity.

10. The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.

11. And those who know thy name put their trust in thee, for thou, O LORD, hast not forsaken those who seek thee.

12. Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion! Tell among the peoples his deeds!

13. For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.

14. Be gracious to me, O LORD! Behold what I suffer from those who hate me, O thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,

15. that I may recount all thy praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in thy deliverance.

16. The nations have sunk in the pit which they made; in the net which they hid has their own foot been caught.

17. The LORD has made himself known, he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. [Higgaion. Selah]

18. The wicked shall depart to Sheol, all the nations that forget God.

19. For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.

20. Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before thee! [ (Psalms 9:21) Put them in fear, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! [Selah] ]

## Psalms 10

1. Why dost thou stand afar off, O LORD? Why dost thou hide thyself in times of trouble?

2. In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes which they have devised.

3. For the wicked boasts of the desires of his heart, and the man greedy for gain curses and renounces the LORD.

4. In the pride of his countenance the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, "There is no God."

5. His ways prosper at all times; thy judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at them.

6. He thinks in his heart, "I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity."

7. His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.

8. He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the hapless,

9. he lurks in secret like a lion in his covert; he lurks that he may seize the poor, he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.

10. The hapless is crushed, sinks down, and falls by his might.

11. He thinks in his heart, "God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it."

12. Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thy hand; forget not the afflicted.

13. Why does the wicked renounce God, and say in his heart, "Thou wilt not call to account"?

14. Thou dost see; yea, thou dost note trouble and vexation, that thou mayest take it into thy hands; the hapless commits himself to thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.

15. Break thou the arm of the wicked and evildoer; seek out his wickedness till thou find none.

16. The LORD is king for ever and ever; the nations shall perish from his land.

17. O LORD, thou wilt hear the desire of the meek; thou wilt strengthen their heart, thou wilt incline thy ear

18. to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.

## Psalms 11

1. To the choirmaster. Of David.

2. In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to me, "Flee like a bird to the mountains;

3. for lo, the wicked bend the bow, they have fitted their arrow to the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;

4. if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do"?

5. The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven; his eyes behold, his eyelids test, the children of men.

6. The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked, and his soul hates him that loves violence.

7. On the wicked he will rain coals of fire and brimstone; a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. [ (Psalms 11:8) For the LORD is righteous, he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face. ]

## Psalms 12

1. To the choirmaster: according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David.

2. Help, LORD; for there is no longer any that is godly; for the faithful have vanished from among the sons of men.

3. Every one utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.

4. May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,

5. those who say, "With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is our master?"

6. "Because the poor are despoiled, because the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD; "I will place him in the safety for which he longs."

7. The promises of the LORD are promises that are pure, silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.

8. Do thou, O LORD, protect us, guard us ever from this generation. [ (Psalms 12:9) On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the sons of men. ]

## Psalms 13

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. How long, O LORD? Wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

3. How long must I bear pain in my soul, and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?

4. Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;

5. lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him"; lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.

6. But I have trusted in thy steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. [ (Psalms 13:7) I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me. ]

## Psalms 14

1. To the choirmaster. Of David.

2. The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none that does good.

3. The LORD looks down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there are any that act wisely, that seek after God.

4. They have all gone astray, they are all alike corrupt; there is none that does good, no, not one.

5. Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon the LORD?

6. There they shall be in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous.

7. You would confound the plans of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge. [ (Psalms 14:8) O that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, Israel shall be glad. ]

## Psalms 15

1. A Psalm of David.

2. O LORD, who shall sojourn in thy tent? Who shall dwell on thy holy hill?

3. He who walks blamelessly, and does what is right, and speaks truth from his heart;

4. who does not slander with his tongue, and does no evil to his friend, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;

5. in whose eyes a reprobate is despised, but who honors those who fear the LORD; who swears to his own hurt and does not change; [ (Psalms 15:6) who does not put out his money at interest, and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved. ]

## Psalms 16

1. A Miktam of David.

2. Preserve me, O God, for in thee I take refuge.

3. I say to the LORD, "Thou art my Lord; I have no good apart from thee."

4. As for the saints in the land, they are the noble, in whom is all my delight.

5. Those who choose another god multiply their sorrows; their libations of blood I will not pour out or take their names upon my lips.

6. The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; thou holdest my lot.

7. The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

8. I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.

9. I keep the LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

10. Therefore my heart is glad, and my soul rejoices; my body also dwells secure.

11. For thou dost not give me up to Sheol, or let thy godly one see the Pit. [ (Psalms 16:12) Thou dost show me the path of life; in thy presence there is fulness of joy, in thy right hand are pleasures for evermore. ]

## Psalms 17

1. A Prayer of David.

2. Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry! Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!

3. From thee let my vindication come! Let thy eyes see the right!

4. If thou triest my heart, if thou visitest me by night, if thou testest me, thou wilt find no wickedness in me; my mouth does not transgress.

5. With regard to the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.

6. My steps have held fast to thy paths, my feet have not slipped.

7. I call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God; incline thy ear to me, hear my words.

8. Wondrously show thy steadfast love, O savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at thy right hand.

9. Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of thy wings,

10. from the wicked who despoil me, my deadly enemies who surround me.

11. They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.

12. They track me down; now they surround me; they set their eyes to cast me to the ground.

13. They are like a lion eager to tear, as a young lion lurking in ambush.

14. Arise, O LORD! confront them, overthrow them! Deliver my life from the wicked by thy sword,

15. from men by thy hand, O LORD, from men whose portion in life is of the world. May their belly be filled with what thou hast stored up for them; may their children have more than enough; may they leave something over to their babes. [ (Psalms 17:16) As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with beholding thy form. ]

## Psalms 18

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD, who addressed the words of this song to the LORD on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said:

2. I love thee, O LORD, my strength.

3. The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

4. I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.

5. The cords of death encompassed me, the torrents of perdition assailed me;

6. the cords of Sheol entangled me, the snares of death confronted me.

7. In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.

8. Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.

9. Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.

10. He bowed the heavens, and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.

11. He rode on a cherub, and flew; he came swiftly upon the wings of the wind.

12. He made darkness his covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water.

13. Out of the brightness before him there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire.

14. The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.

15. And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings, and routed them.

16. Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

17. He reached from on high, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

18. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.

19. They came upon me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my stay.

20. He brought me forth into a broad place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

21. The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.

22. For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

23. For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.

24. I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.

25. Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.

26. With the loyal thou dost show thyself loyal; with the blameless man thou dost show thyself blameless;

27. with the pure thou dost show thyself pure; and with the crooked thou dost show thyself perverse.

28. For thou dost deliver a humble people; but the haughty eyes thou dost bring down.

29. Yea, thou dost light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness.

30. Yea, by thee I can crush a troop; and by my God I can leap over a wall.

31. This God--his way is perfect; the promise of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.

32. For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?--

33. the God who girded me with strength, and made my way safe.

34. He made my feet like hinds' feet, and set me secure on the heights.

35. He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.

36. Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand supported me, and thy help made me great.

37. Thou didst give a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.

38. I pursued my enemies and overtook them; and did not turn back till they were consumed.

39. I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.

40. For thou didst gird me with strength for the battle; thou didst make my assailants sink under me.

41. Thou didst make my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.

42. They cried for help, but there was none to save, they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.

43. I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.

44. Thou didst deliver me from strife with the peoples; thou didst make me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.

45. As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.

46. Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their fastnesses.

47. The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,

48. the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me;

49. who delivered me from my enemies; yea, thou didst exalt me above my adversaries; thou didst deliver me from men of violence.

50. For this I will extol thee, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to thy name. [ (Psalms 18:51) Great triumphs he gives to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants for ever. ]

## Psalms 19

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.

3. Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge.

4. There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard;

5. yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,

6. which comes forth like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and like a strong man runs its course with joy.

7. Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them; and there is nothing hid from its heat.

8. The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;

9. the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes;

10. the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; the ordinances of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.

11. More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.

12. Moreover by them is thy servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.

13. But who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults.

14. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. [ (Psalms 19:15) Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer. ]

## Psalms 20

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. The LORD answer you in the day of trouble! The name of the God of Jacob protect you!

3. May he send you help from the sanctuary, and give you support from Zion!

4. May he remember all your offerings, and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! [Selah]

5. May he grant you your heart's desire, and fulfil all your plans!

6. May we shout for joy over your victory, and in the name of our God set up our banners! May the LORD fulfil all your petitions!

7. Now I know that the LORD will help his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with mighty victories by his right hand.

8. Some boast of chariots, and some of horses; but we boast of the name of the LORD our God.

9. They will collapse and fall; but we shall rise and stand upright. [ (Psalms 20:10) Give victory to the king, O LORD; answer us when we call. ]

## Psalms 21

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. In thy strength the king rejoices, O LORD; and in thy help how greatly he exults!

3. Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withheld the request of his lips. [Selah]

4. For thou dost meet him with goodly blessings; thou dost set a crown of fine gold upon his head.

5. He asked life of thee; thou gavest it to him, length of days for ever and ever.

6. His glory is great through thy help; splendor and majesty thou dost bestow upon him.

7. Yea, thou dost make him most blessed for ever; thou dost make him glad with the joy of thy presence.

8. For the king trusts in the LORD; and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.

9. Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you.

10. You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath; and fire will consume them.

11. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their children from among the sons of men.

12. If they plan evil against you, if they devise mischief, they will not succeed.

13. For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows. [ (Psalms 21:14) Be exalted, O LORD, in thy strength! We will sing and praise thy power. ]

## Psalms 22

1. To the choirmaster: according to The Hind of the Dawn. A Psalm of David.

2. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?

3. O my God, I cry by day, but thou dost not answer; and by night, but find no rest.

4. Yet thou art holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.

5. In thee our fathers trusted; they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.

6. To thee they cried, and were saved; in thee they trusted, and were not disappointed.

7. But I am a worm, and no man; scorned by men, and despised by the people.

8. All who see me mock at me, they make mouths at me, they wag their heads;

9. "He committed his cause to the LORD; let him deliver him, let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"

10. Yet thou art he who took me from the womb; thou didst keep me safe upon my mother's breasts.

11. Upon thee was I cast from my birth, and since my mother bore me thou hast been my God.

12. Be not far from me, for trouble is near and there is none to help.

13. Many bulls encompass me, strong bulls of Bashan surround me;

14. they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.

15. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, it is melted within my breast;

16. my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; thou dost lay me in the dust of death.

17. Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet--

18. I can count all my bones-- they stare and gloat over me;

19. they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots.

20. But thou, O LORD, be not far off! O thou my help, hasten to my aid!

21. Deliver my soul from the sword, my life from the power of the dog!

22. Save me from the mouth of the lion, my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild oxen!

23. I will tell of thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee:

24. You who fear the LORD, praise him! all you sons of Jacob, glorify him, and stand in awe of him, all you sons of Israel!

25. For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; and he has not hid his face from him, but has heard, when he cried to him.

26. From thee comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will pay before those who fear him.

27. The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the LORD! May your hearts live for ever!

28. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD; and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.

29. For dominion belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.

30. Yea, to him shall all the proud of the earth bow down; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, and he who cannot keep himself alive.

31. Posterity shall serve him; men shall tell of the Lord to the coming generation, [ (Psalms 22:32) and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn, that he has wrought it. ]

## Psalms 23

1. A Psalm of David.

2. The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want;

3. he makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters;

5. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

6. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies; thou anointest my head with oil, my cup overflows. [ (Psalms 23:7) Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. ]

7. Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. [Selah]

5. Make me to know thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

6. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me, for thou art the God of my salvation; for thee I wait all the day long.

7. Be mindful of thy mercy, O LORD, and of thy steadfast love, for they have been from of old.

8. Remember not the sins of my youth, or my transgressions; according to thy steadfast love remember me, for thy goodness' sake, O LORD!

9. Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in the way.

5. I do not sit with false men, nor do I consort with dissemblers;

6. I hate the company of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked.

7. I wash my hands in innocence, and go about thy altar, O LORD,

8. singing aloud a song of thanksgiving, and telling all thy wondrous deeds.

9. O LORD, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwells.

10. Sweep me not away with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men,

11. men in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes.

5. One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.

6. For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent, he will set me high upon a rock.

7. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies round about me; and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the LORD.

8. Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud, be gracious to me and answer me!

9. Thou hast said, "Seek ye my face." My heart says to thee, "Thy face, LORD, do I seek."

10. Hide not thy face from me. Turn not thy servant away in anger, thou who hast been my help. Cast me not off, forsake me not, O God of my salvation!

12. Teach me thy way, O LORD; and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.

4. O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol, restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit.

5. Sing praises to the LORD, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name.

6. For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning.

7. As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."

8. By thy favor, O LORD, thou hadst established me as a strong mountain; thou didst hide thy face, I was dismayed.

9. To thee, O LORD, I cried; and to the LORD I made supplication:

10. "What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise thee? Will it tell of thy faithfulness?

11. Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me! O LORD, be thou my helper!"

12. Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness, [ (Psalms 30:13) that my soul may praise thee and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to thee for ever. ]

## Psalms 31

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. In thee, O LORD, do I seek refuge; let me never be put to shame; in thy righteousness deliver me!

3. Incline thy ear to me, rescue me speedily! Be thou a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to save me!

4. Yea, thou art my rock and my fortress; for thy name's sake lead me and guide me,

5. take me out of the net which is hidden for me, for thou art my refuge.

6. Into thy hand I commit my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.

7. Thou hatest those who pay regard to vain idols; but I trust in the LORD.

8. I will rejoice and be glad for thy steadfast love, because thou hast seen my affliction, thou hast taken heed of my adversities,

9. and hast not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; thou hast set my feet in a broad place.

10. Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eye is wasted from grief, my soul and my body also.

11. For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of my misery, and my bones waste away.

12. I am the scorn of all my adversaries, a horror to my neighbors, an object of dread to my acquaintances; those who see me in the street flee from me.

13. I have passed out of mind like one who is dead; I have become like a broken vessel.

14. Yea, I hear the whispering of many-- terror on every side!-- as they scheme together against me, as they plot to take my life.

15. But I trust in thee, O LORD, I say, "Thou art my God."

16. My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies and persecutors!

17. Let thy face shine on thy servant; save me in thy steadfast love!

18. Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I call on thee; let the wicked be put to shame, let them go dumbfounded to Sheol.

19. Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak insolently against the righteous in pride and contempt.

20. O how abundant is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for those who fear thee, and wrought for those who take refuge in thee, in the sight of the sons of men!

21. In the covert of thy presence thou hidest them from the plots of men; thou holdest them safe under thy shelter from the strife of tongues.

22. Blessed be the LORD, for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me when I was beset as in a besieged city.

23. I had said in my alarm, "I am driven far from thy sight." But thou didst hear my supplications, when I cried to thee for help.

24. Love the LORD, all you his saints! The LORD preserves the faithful, but abundantly requites him who acts haughtily. [ (Psalms 31:25) Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the LORD! ]

## Psalms 32

1. A Psalm of David. A Maskil.

2. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

3. Blessed is the man to whom the LORD imputes no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.

4. When I declared not my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long.

5. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. [Selah]

6. I acknowledged my sin to thee, and I did not hide my iniquity; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"; then thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin. [Selah]

7. Therefore let every one who is godly offer prayer to thee; at a time of distress, in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him.

8. Thou art a hiding place for me, thou preservest me from trouble; thou dost encompass me with deliverance. [Selah]

9. I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.

10. Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding, which must be curbed with bit and bridle, else it will not keep with you.

## Psalms 33

1. Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous! Praise befits the upright.

2. Praise the LORD with the lyre, make melody to him with the harp of ten strings!

3. Sing to him a new song, play skilfully on the strings, with loud shouts.

4. For the word of the LORD is upright; and all his work is done in faithfulness.

5. He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD.

6. By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of his mouth.

7. He gathered the waters of the sea as in a bottle; he put the deeps in storehouses.

8. Let all the earth fear the LORD, let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!

9. For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood forth.

10. The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nought; he frustrates the plans of the peoples.

11. The counsel of the LORD stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

12. Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage!

13. The LORD looks down from heaven, he sees all the sons of men;

14. from where he sits enthroned he looks forth on all the inhabitants of the earth,

15. he who fashions the hearts of them all, and observes all their deeds.

16. A king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.

17. The war horse is a vain hope for victory, and by its great might it cannot save.

18. Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love,

19. that he may deliver their soul from death, and keep them alive in famine.

20. Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and shield.

21. Yea, our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name.

22. Let thy steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in thee.

## Psalms 34

6. Look to him, and be radiant; so your faces shall never be ashamed.

7. This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.

8. The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.

9. O taste and see that the LORD is good! Happy is the man who takes refuge in him!

10. O fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him have no want!

11. The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.

12. Come, O sons, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the LORD.

13. What man is there who desires life, and covets many days, that he may enjoy good?

14. Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.

15. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

16. The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and his ears toward their cry.

17. The face of the LORD is against evildoers, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.

## Psalms 35

1. A Psalm of David.

2. Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me!

3. Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help!

4. Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers! Say to my soul, "I am your deliverance!"

5. Let them be put to shame and dishonor who seek after my life! Let them be turned back and confounded who devise evil against me!

6. Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them on!

7. Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them!

8. For without cause they hid their net for me; without cause they dug a pit for my life.

9. Let ruin come upon them unawares! And let the net which they hid ensnare them; let them fall therein to ruin!

10. Then my soul shall rejoice in the LORD, exulting in his deliverance.

11. All my bones shall say, "O LORD, who is like thee, thou who deliverest the weak from him who is too strong for him, the weak and needy from him who despoils him?"

12. Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I know not.

13. They requite me evil for good; my soul is forlorn.

14. But I, when they were sick-- I wore sackcloth, I afflicted myself with fasting. I prayed with head bowed on my bosom,

15. as though I grieved for my friend or my brother; I went about as one who laments his mother, bowed down and in mourning.

16. But at my stumbling they gathered in glee, they gathered together against me; cripples whom I knew not slandered me without ceasing;

17. they impiously mocked more and more, gnashing at me with their teeth.

18. How long, O LORD, wilt thou look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my life from the lions!

19. Then I will thank thee in the great congregation; in the mighty throng I will praise thee.

20. Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause.

21. For they do not speak peace, but against those who are quiet in the land they conceive words of deceit.

22. They open wide their mouths against me; they say, "Aha, Aha! our eyes have seen it!"

23. Thou hast seen, O LORD; be not silent! O Lord, be not far from me!

24. Bestir thyself, and awake for my right, for my cause, my God and my Lord!

25. Vindicate me, O LORD, my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me!

26. Let them not say to themselves, "Aha, we have our heart's desire!" Let them not say, "We have swallowed him up."

27. Let them be put to shame and confusion altogether who rejoice at my calamity! Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me!

28. Let those who desire my vindication shout for joy and be glad, and say evermore, "Great is the LORD, who delights in the welfare of his servant!" [ (Psalms 35:29) Then my tongue shall tell of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long. ]

## Psalms 36

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD.

2. Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes.

3. For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.

4. The words of his mouth are mischief and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good.

5. He plots mischief while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he spurns not evil.

6. Thy steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, thy faithfulness to the clouds.

7. Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God, thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast thou savest, O LORD.

8. How precious is thy steadfast love, O God! The children of men take refuge in the shadow of thy wings.

9. They feast on the abundance of thy house, and thou givest them drink from the river of thy delights.

10. For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light do we see light.

11. O continue thy steadfast love to those who know thee, and thy salvation to the upright of heart!

12. Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. [ (Psalms 36:13) There the evildoers lie prostrate, they are thrust down, unable to rise. ]

5. Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.

6. Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.

7. He will bring forth your vindication as the light, and your right as the noonday.

8. Be still before the LORD, and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over him who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices!

9. Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.

10. For the wicked shall be cut off; but those who wait for the LORD shall possess the land.

11. Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look well at his place, he will not be there.

12. But the meek shall possess the land, and delight themselves in abundant prosperity.

13. The wicked plots against the righteous, and gnashes his teeth at him;

14. but the LORD laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming.

15. The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows, to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those who walk uprightly;

16. their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.

17. Better is a little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked.

18. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the LORD upholds the righteous.

19. The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will abide for ever;

20. they are not put to shame in evil times, in the days of famine they have abundance.

21. But the wicked perish; the enemies of the LORD are like the glory of the pastures, they vanish--like smoke they vanish away.

22. The wicked borrows, and cannot pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives;

23. for those blessed by the LORD shall possess the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off.

24. The steps of a man are from the LORD, and he establishes him in whose way he delights;

25. though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the LORD is the stay of his hand.

26. I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging bread.

27. He is ever giving liberally and lending, and his children become a blessing.

28. Depart from evil, and do good; so shall you abide for ever.

29. For the LORD loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. The righteous shall be preserved for ever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.

30. The righteous shall possess the land, and dwell upon it for ever.

31. The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.

32. The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.

33. The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.

34. The LORD will not abandon him to his power, or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial.

35. Wait for the LORD, and keep to his way, and he will exalt you to possess the land; you will look on the destruction of the wicked.

36. I have seen a wicked man overbearing, and towering like a cedar of Lebanon.

37. Again I passed by, and, lo, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.

38. Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright, for there is posterity for the man of peace.

39. But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the posterity of the wicked shall be cut off.

40. The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; he is their refuge in the time of trouble. [ (Psalms 37:41) The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked, and saves them, because they take refuge in him. ]

## Psalms 38

1. A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering.

2. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, nor chasten me in thy wrath!

3. For thy arrows have sunk into me, and thy hand has come down on me.

4. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.

5. For my iniquities have gone over my head; they weigh like a burden too heavy for me.

6. My wounds grow foul and fester because of my foolishness,

7. I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all the day I go about mourning.

8. For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.

9. I am utterly spent and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.

10. Lord, all my longing is known to thee, my sighing is not hidden from thee.

11. My heart throbs, my strength fails me; and the light of my eyes--it also has gone from me.

12. My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand afar off.

13. Those who seek my life lay their snares, those who seek my hurt speak of ruin, and meditate treachery all the day long.

14. But I am like a deaf man, I do not hear, like a dumb man who does not open his mouth.

15. Yea, I am like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes.

16. But for thee, O LORD, do I wait; it is thou, O LORD my God, who wilt answer.

17. For I pray, "Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips!"

18. For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.

19. I confess my iniquity, I am sorry for my sin.

20. Those who are my foes without cause are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully.

21. Those who render me evil for good are my adversaries because I follow after good.

22. Do not forsake me, O LORD! O my God, be not far from me! [ (Psalms 38:23) Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation! ]

## Psalms 39

1. To the choirmaster: to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.

2. I said, "I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will bridle my mouth, so long as the wicked are in my presence."

3. I was dumb and silent, I held my peace to no avail; my distress grew worse,

4. my heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:

5. "LORD, let me know my end, and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is!

6. Behold, thou hast made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing in thy sight. Surely every man stands as a mere breath! [Selah]

7. Surely man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nought are they in turmoil; man heaps up, and knows not who will gather!

8. "And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in thee.

9. Deliver me from all my transgressions. Make me not the scorn of the fool!

10. I am dumb, I do not open my mouth; for it is thou who hast done it.

11. Remove thy stroke from me; I am spent by the blows of thy hand.

12. When thou dost chasten man with rebukes for sin, thou dost consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely every man is a mere breath! [Selah]

13. "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears! For I am thy passing guest, a sojourner, like all my fathers. [ (Psalms 39:14) Look away from me, that I may know gladness, before I depart and be no more!" ]

## Psalms 40

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.

3. He drew me up from the desolate pit, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.

4. He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.

5. Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after false gods!

6. Thou hast multiplied, O LORD my God, thy wondrous deeds and thy thoughts toward us; none can compare with thee! Were I to proclaim and tell of them, they would be more than can be numbered.

7. Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire; but thou hast given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering thou hast not required.

8. Then I said, "Lo, I come; in the roll of the book it is written of me;

9. I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is within my heart."

10. I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; lo, I have not restrained my lips, as thou knowest, O LORD.

11. I have not hid thy saving help within my heart, I have spoken of thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness from the great congregation.

12. Do not thou, O LORD, withhold thy mercy from me, let thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness ever preserve me!

13. For evils have encompassed me without number; my iniquities have overtaken me, till I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.

14. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!

15. Let them be put to shame and confusion altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt!

16. Let them be appalled because of their shame who say to me, "Aha, Aha!"

17. But may all who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; may those who love thy salvation say continually, "Great is the LORD!" [ (Psalms 40:18) As for me, I am poor and needy; but the Lord takes thought for me. Thou art my help and my deliverer; do not tarry, O my God! ]

## Psalms 41

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. Blessed is he who considers the poor! The LORD delivers him in the day of trouble;

3. the LORD protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; thou dost not give him up to the will of his enemies.

4. The LORD sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness thou healest all his infirmities.

5. As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against thee!"

6. My enemies say of me in malice: "When will he die, and his name perish?"

7. And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers mischief; when he goes out, he tells it abroad.

8. All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.

9. They say, "A deadly thing has fastened upon him; he will not rise again from where he lies."

10. Even my bosom friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted his heel against me.

11. But do thou, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may requite them!

12. By this I know that thou art pleased with me, in that my enemy has not triumphed over me.

13. But thou hast upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in thy presence for ever. [ (Psalms 41:14) Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen. ]

## Psalms 42

1. To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah.

2. As a hart longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for thee, O God.

3. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?

4. My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me continually, "Where is your God?"

5. These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I went with the throng, and led them in procession to the house of God, with glad shouts and songs of thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.

6. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help

7. and my God. My soul is cast down within me, therefore I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.

8. Deep calls to deep at the thunder of thy cataracts; all thy waves and thy billows have gone over me.

9. By day the LORD commands his steadfast love; and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.

10. I say to God, my rock: "Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"

11. As with a deadly wound in my body, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me continually, "Where is your God?" [ (Psalms 42:12) Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God. ]

## Psalms 43

1. Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people; from deceitful and unjust men deliver me!

2. For thou art the God in whom I take refuge; why hast thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

3. Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me, let them bring me to thy holy hill and to thy dwelling!

4. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; and I will praise thee with the lyre, O God, my God.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God.

## Psalms 44

1. To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah.

2. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what deeds thou didst perform in their days, in the days of old:

3. thou with thy own hand didst drive out the nations, but them thou didst plant; thou didst afflict the peoples, but them thou didst set free;

4. for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm give them victory; but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance; for thou didst delight in them.

5. Thou art my King and my God, who ordainest victories for Jacob.

6. Through thee we push down our foes; through thy name we tread down our assailants.

7. For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.

8. But thou hast saved us from our foes, and hast put to confusion those who hate us.

9. In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to thy name for ever. [Selah]

10. Yet thou hast cast us off and abased us, and hast not gone out with our armies.

11. Thou hast made us turn back from the foe; and our enemies have gotten spoil.

12. Thou hast made us like sheep for slaughter, and hast scattered us among the nations.

13. Thou hast sold thy people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them.

14. Thou hast made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those about us.

15. Thou hast made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.

16. All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face,

17. at the words of the taunters and revilers, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.

18. All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten thee, or been false to thy covenant.

19. Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from thy way,

20. that thou shouldst have broken us in the place of jackals, and covered us with deep darkness.

21. If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god,

22. would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.

23. Nay, for thy sake we are slain all the day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

24. Rouse thyself! Why sleepest thou, O Lord? Awake! Do not cast us off for ever!

25. Why dost thou hide thy face? Why dost thou forget our affliction and oppression?

26. For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our body cleaves to the ground. [ (Psalms 44:27) Rise up, come to our help! Deliver us for the sake of thy steadfast love! ]

## Psalms 45

1. To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah; a love song.

2. My heart overflows with a goodly theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.

3. You are the fairest of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you for ever.

4. Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, in your glory and majesty!

5. In your majesty ride forth victoriously for the cause of truth and to defend the right; let your right hand teach you dread deeds!

6. Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you.

7. Your divine throne endures for ever and ever. Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity;

8. you love righteousness and hate wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows;

9. your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;

10. daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.

11. Hear, O daughter, consider, and incline your ear; forget your people and your father's house;

12. and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him;

13. the people of Tyre will sue your favor with gifts, the richest of the people

14. with all kinds of wealth. The princess is decked in her chamber with gold-woven robes;

15. in many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions, her escort, in her train.

16. With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.

17. Instead of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth. [ (Psalms 45:18) I will cause your name to be celebrated in all generations; therefore the peoples will praise you for ever and ever. ]

## Psalms 46

4. though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble with its tumult. [Selah]

5. There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.

6. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God will help her right early.

8. The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. [Selah]

9. Come, behold the works of the LORD, how he has wrought desolations in the earth.

10. He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow, and shatters the spear, he burns the chariots with fire!

11. "Be still, and know that I am God. I am exalted among the nations, I am exalted in the earth!" [ (Psalms 46:12) The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. [Selah] ]

## Psalms 47

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.

2. Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy!

3. For the LORD, the Most High, is terrible, a great king over all the earth.

4. He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.

5. He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. [Selah]

6. God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

7. Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!

8. For God is the king of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm!

9. God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne. [ (Psalms 47:10) The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted! ]

## Psalms 48

1. A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.

2. Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain,

3. beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.

4. Within her citadels God has shown himself a sure defense.

5. For lo, the kings assembled, they came on together.

6. As soon as they saw it, they were astounded, they were in panic, they took to flight;

7. trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in travail.

8. By the east wind thou didst shatter the ships of Tarshish.

9. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God establishes for ever. [Selah]

10. We have thought on thy steadfast love, O God, in the midst of thy temple.

11. As thy name, O God, so thy praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Thy right hand is filled with victory;

12. let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of thy judgments!

13. Walk about Zion, go round about her, number her towers,

14. consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels; that you may tell the next generation [ (Psalms 48:15) that this is God, our God for ever and ever. He will be our guide for ever. ]

## Psalms 49

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.

3. both low and high, rich and poor together!

4. My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.

5. I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.

6. Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of my persecutors surrounds me,

7. men who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?

8. Truly no man can ransom himself, or give to God the price of his life,

9. for the ransom of his life is costly, and can never suffice,

10. that he should continue to live on for ever, and never see the Pit.

11. Yea, he shall see that even the wise die, the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.

12. Their graves are their homes for ever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they named lands their own.

13. Man cannot abide in his pomp, he is like the beasts that perish.

14. This is the fate of those who have foolish confidence, the end of those who are pleased with their portion. [Selah]

15. Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; straight to the grave they descend, and their form shall waste away; Sheol shall be their home.

16. But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. [Selah]

17. Be not afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.

18. For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.

19. Though, while he lives, he counts himself happy, and though a man gets praise when he does well for himself,

20. he will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never more see the light. [ (Psalms 49:21) Man cannot abide in his pomp, he is like the beasts that perish. ]

5. He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people:

6. "Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!"

7. The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge! [Selah]

8. "Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.

9. I do not reprove you for your sacrifices; your burnt offerings are continually before me.

10. I will accept no bull from your house, nor he-goat from your folds.

11. For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.

12. I know all the birds of the air, and all that moves in the field is mine.

13. "If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world and all that is in it is mine.

14. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

15. Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High;

16. and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."

17. But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to recite my statutes, or take my covenant on your lips?

18. For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.

19. If you see a thief, you are a friend of his; and you keep company with adulterers.

20. "You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.

21. You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.

22. These things you have done and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you, and lay the charge before you.

23. "Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I rend, and there be none to deliver! [ (Psalms 50:24) He who brings thanksgiving as his sacrifice honors me; to him who orders his way aright I will show the salvation of God!" ]

## Psalms 51

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

3. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!

4. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.

5. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in thy sight, so that thou art justified in thy sentence and blameless in thy judgment.

6. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

7. Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.

8. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

9. Fill me with joy and gladness; let the bones which thou hast broken rejoice.

10. Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

11. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.

12. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.

13. Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.

14. Then I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners will return to thee.

15. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of thy deliverance.

16. O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.

17. For thou hast no delight in sacrifice; were I to give a burnt offering, thou wouldst not be pleased.

18. The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

19. Do good to Zion in thy good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, [ (Psalms 51:20) then wilt thou delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on thy altar. ]

## Psalms 52

1. To the choirmaster. A Maskil of David, when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, "David has come to the house of Ahimelech."

2. Why do you boast, O mighty man, of mischief done against the godly? All the day

3. you are plotting destruction. Your tongue is like a sharp razor, you worker of treachery.

4. You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking the truth. [Selah]

5. You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.

6. But God will break you down for ever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. [Selah]

7. The righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,

8. "See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and sought refuge in his wealth!"

9. But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God for ever and ever. [ (Psalms 52:10) I will thank thee for ever, because thou hast done it. I will proclaim thy name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly. ]

## Psalms 53

1. To the choirmaster: according to Mahalath. A Maskil of David.

2. The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; there is none that does good.

3. God looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if there are any that are wise, that seek after God.

4. They have all fallen away; they are all alike depraved; there is none that does good, no, not one.

5. Have those who work evil no understanding, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?

6. There they are, in great terror, in terror such as has not been! For God will scatter the bones of the ungodly; they will be put to shame, for God has rejected them. [ (Psalms 53:7) O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad. ]

## Psalms 54

1. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, "David is in hiding among us."

2. Save me, O God, by thy name, and vindicate me by thy might.

4. For insolent men have risen against me, ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before them. [Selah]

5. Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.

6. He will requite my enemies with evil; in thy faithfulness put an end to them.

7. With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to thee; I will give thanks to thy name, O LORD, for it is good. [ (Psalms 54:8) For thou hast delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies. ]

## Psalms 55

1. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David.

2. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication!

3. Attend to me, and answer me; I am overcome by my trouble. I am distraught

4. by the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring trouble upon me, and in anger they cherish enmity against me.

5. My heart is in anguish within me, the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

6. Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.

7. And I say, "O that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;

8. yea, I would wander afar, I would lodge in the wilderness, [Selah]

9. I would haste to find me a shelter from the raging wind and tempest."

10. Destroy their plans, O Lord, confuse their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city.

11. Day and night they go around it on its walls; and mischief and trouble are within it,

12. ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its market place.

13. It is not an enemy who taunts me-- then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me-- then I could hide from him.

14. But it is you, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend.

15. We used to hold sweet converse together; within God's house we walked in fellowship.

16. Let death come upon them; let them go down to Sheol alive; let them go away in terror into their graves.

17. But I call upon God; and the LORD will save me.

18. Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he will hear my voice.

19. He will deliver my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.

20. God will give ear, and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old; because they keep no law, and do not fear God. [Selah]

21. My companion stretched out his hand against his friends, he violated his covenant.

22. His speech was smoother than butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.

23. Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved. [ (Psalms 55:24) But thou, O God, wilt cast them down into the lowest pit; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in thee. ]

## Psalms 56

1. To the choirmaster: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths. A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.

2. Be gracious to me, O God, for men trample upon me; all day long foemen oppress me;

3. my enemies trample upon me all day long, for many fight against me proudly.

4. When I am afraid, I put my trust in thee.

5. In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust without a fear. What can flesh do to me?

6. All day long they seek to injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.

7. They band themselves together, they lurk, they watch my steps. As they have waited for my life,

8. so recompense them for their crime; in wrath cast down the peoples, O God!

9. Thou hast kept count of my tossings; put thou my tears in thy bottle! Are they not in thy book?

10. Then my enemies will be turned back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.

11. In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,

12. in God I trust without a fear. What can man do to me?

13. My vows to thee I must perform, O God; I will render thank offerings to thee. [ (Psalms 56:14) For thou hast delivered my soul from death, yea, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life. ]

## Psalms 57

1. To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.

2. Be merdiful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in thee my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of thy wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.

3. I cry to God Most High, to God who fulfils his purpose for me.

4. He will send from heaven and save me, he will put to shame those who trample upon me. [Selah] God will send forth his steadfast love and his faithfulness!

5. I lie in the midst of lions that greedily devour the sons of men; their teeth are spears and arrows, their tongues sharp swords.

6. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let thy glory be over all the earth!

7. They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves. [Selah]

8. My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody!

9. Awake, my soul! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!

10. I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to thee among the nations.

11. For thy steadfast love is great to the heavens, thy faithfulness to the clouds. [ (Psalms 57:12) Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let thy glory be over all the earth! ]

## Psalms 58

1. To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David.

2. Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the sons of men uprightly?

3. Nay, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.

4. The wicked go astray from the womb, they err from their birth, speaking lies.

5. They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,

6. so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.

7. O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!

8. Let them vanish like water that runs away; like grass let them be trodden down and wither.

9. Let them be like the snail which dissolves into slime, like the untimely birth that never sees the sun.

10. Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!

11. The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked. [ (Psalms 58:12) Men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth." ]

## Psalms 59

1. To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him.

2. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God, protect me from those who rise up against me,

3. deliver me from those who work evil, and save me from bloodthirsty men.

4. For, lo, they lie in wait for my life; fierce men band themselves against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O LORD,

5. for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Rouse thyself, come to my help, and see!

6. Thou, LORD God of hosts, art God of Israel. Awake to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. [Selah]

7. Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.

8. There they are, bellowing with their mouths, and snarling with their lips-- for "Who," they think, "will hear us?"

9. But thou, O LORD, dost laugh at them; thou dost hold all the nations in derision.

10. O my Strength, I will sing praises to thee; for thou, O God, art my fortress.

11. My God in his steadfast love will meet me; my God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.

12. Slay them not, lest my people forget; make them totter by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield!

13. For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies which they utter,

14. consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more, that men may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. [Selah]

15. Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.

16. They roam about for food, and growl if they do not get their fill.

17. But I will sing of thy might; I will sing aloud of thy steadfast love in the morning. For thou hast been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress. [ (Psalms 59:18) O my Strength, I will sing praises to thee, for thou, O God, art my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love. ]

3. Thou hast made the land to quake, thou hast rent it open; repair its breaches, for it totters.

4. Thou hast made thy people suffer hard things; thou hast given us wine to drink that made us reel.

5. Thou hast set up a banner for those who fear thee, to rally to it from the bow. [Selah]

6. That thy beloved may be delivered, give victory by thy right hand and answer us!

7. God has spoken in his sanctuary: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth.

8. Gilead is mine; Manas'seh is mine; E'phraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.

9. Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."

10. Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

11. Hast thou not rejected us, O God? Thou dost not go forth, O God, with our armies.

1. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.

5. Let me dwell in thy tent for ever! Oh to be safe under the shelter of thy wings! [Selah]

1. To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.

2. For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation.

3. He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly moved.

4. How long will you set upon a man to shatter him, all of you, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?

5. They only plan to thrust him down from his eminence. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. [Selah]

6. For God alone my soul waits in silence, for my hope is from him.

7. He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken.

8. On God rests my deliverance and my honor; my mighty rock, my refuge is God.

9. Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. [Selah]

10. Men of low estate are but a breath, men of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath.

11. Put no confidence in extortion, set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them.

12. Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God; [ (Psalms 62:13) and that to thee, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For thou dost requite a man according to his work. ]

## Psalms 63

1. A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah.

2. O God, thou art my God, I seek thee, my soul thirsts for thee; my flesh faints for thee, as in a dry and weary land where no water is.

3. So I have looked upon thee in the sanctuary, beholding thy power and glory.

4. Because thy steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise thee.

5. So I will bless thee as long as I live; I will lift up my hands and call on thy name.

6. My soul is feasted as with marrow and fat, and my mouth praises thee with joyful lips,

7. when I think of thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the watches of the night;

8. for thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings I sing for joy.

9. My soul clings to thee; thy right hand upholds me.

10. But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth;

11. they shall be given over to the power of the sword, they shall be prey for jackals. [ (Psalms 63:12) But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall glory; for the mouths of liars will be stopped. ]

## Psalms 64

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy,

3. hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the scheming of evildoers,

4. who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,

5. shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear.

6. They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, "Who can see us?

7. Who can search out our crimes? We have thought out a cunningly conceived plot." For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep!

8. But God will shoot his arrow at them; they will be wounded suddenly.

9. Because of their tongue he will bring them to ruin; all who see them will wag their heads.

10. Then all men will fear; they will tell what God has wrought, and ponder what he has done. [ (Psalms 64:11) Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD, and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart glory! ]

## Psalms 65

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A Song.

2. Praise is due to thee, O God, in Zion; and to thee shall vows be performed,

4. on account of sins. When our transgressions prevail over us, thou dost forgive them.

5. Blessed is he whom thou dost choose and bring near, to dwell in thy courts! We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, thy holy temple!

6. By dread deeds thou dost answer us with deliverance, O God of our salvation, who art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of the farthest seas;

7. who by thy strength hast established the mountains, being girded with might;

8. who dost still the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, the tumult of the peoples;

9. so that those who dwell at earth's farthest bounds are afraid at thy signs; thou makest the outgoings of the morning and the evening to shout for joy.

10. Thou visitest the earth and waterest it, thou greatly enrichest it; the river of God is full of water; thou providest their grain, for so thou hast prepared it.

11. Thou waterest its furrows abundantly, settling its ridges, softening it with showers, and blessing its growth.

12. Thou crownest the year with thy bounty; the tracks of thy chariot drip with fatness.

5. All the earth worships thee; they sing praises to thee, sing praises to thy name." [Selah]

6. Come and see what God has done: he is terrible in his deeds among men.

7. He turned the sea into dry land; men passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him,

8. who rules by his might for ever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations-- let not the rebellious exalt themselves. [Selah]

9. Bless our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard,

10. who has kept us among the living, and has not let our feet slip.

11. For thou, O God, hast tested us; thou hast tried us as silver is tried.

12. Thou didst bring us into the net; thou didst lay affliction on our loins;

13. thou didst let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet thou hast brought us forth to a spacious place.

14. I will come into thy house with burnt offerings; I will pay thee my vows,

15. that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.

16. I will offer to thee burnt offerings of fatlings, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. [Selah]

17. Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for me.

18. I cried aloud to him, and he was extolled with my tongue.

19. If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.

## Psalms 68

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A Song.

2. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; let those who hate him flee before him!

3. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before fire, let the wicked perish before God!

4. But let the righteous be joyful; let them exult before God; let them be jubilant with joy!

5. Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides upon the clouds; his name is the LORD, exult before him!

6. Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.

7. God gives the desolate a home to dwell in; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity; but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.

8. O God, when thou didst go forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness, [Selah]

9. the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain, at the presence of God; yon Sinai quaked at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

10. Rain in abundance, O God, thou didst shed abroad; thou didst restore thy heritage as it languished;

11. thy flock found a dwelling in it; in thy goodness, O God, thou didst provide for the needy.

12. The Lord gives the command; great is the host of those who bore the tidings:

13. "The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!" The women at home divide the spoil,

14. though they stay among the sheepfolds-- the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with green gold.

15. When the Almighty scattered kings there, snow fell on Zalmon.

16. O mighty mountain, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!

17. Why look you with envy, O many-peaked mountain, at the mount which God desired for his abode, yea, where the LORD will dwell for ever?

18. With mighty chariotry, twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands, the Lord came from Sinai into the holy place.

19. Thou didst ascend the high mount, leading captives in thy train, and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.

20. Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. [Selah]

21. Our God is a God of salvation; and to GOD, the Lord, belongs escape from death.

22. But God will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways.

23. The Lord said, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,

24. that you may bathe your feet in blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe."

25. Thy solemn processions are seen, O God, the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary--

26. the singers in front, the minstrels last, between them maidens playing timbrels:

27. "Bless God in the great congregation, the LORD, O you who are of Israel's fountain!"

28. There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zeb'ulun, the princes of Naph'tali.

29. Summon thy might, O God; show thy strength, O God, thou who hast wrought for us.

30. Because of thy temple at Jerusalem kings bear gifts to thee.

31. Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample under foot those who lust after tribute; scatter the peoples who delight in war.

32. Let bronze be brought from Egypt; let Ethiopia hasten to stretch out her hands to God.

33. Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord, [Selah]

34. to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; lo, he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.

35. Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, and his power is in the skies. [ (Psalms 68:36) Terrible is God in his sanctuary, the God of Israel, he gives power and strength to his people. Blessed be God! ]

## Psalms 69

1. To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Psalm of David.

2. Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck.

3. I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.

4. I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.

5. More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me with lies. What I did not steal must I now restore?

6. O God, thou knowest my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from thee.

7. Let not those who hope in thee be put to shame through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those who seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.

8. For it is for thy sake that I have borne reproach, that shame has covered my face.

9. I have become a stranger to my brethren, an alien to my mother's sons.

10. For zeal for thy house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult thee have fallen on me.

11. When I humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach.

12. When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.

13. I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me.

14. But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O LORD. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of thy steadfast love answer me. With thy faithful help

15. rescue me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.

16. Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me.

17. Answer me, O LORD, for thy steadfast love is good; according to thy abundant mercy, turn to me.

18. Hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in distress, make haste to answer me.

19. Draw near to me, redeem me, set me free because of my enemies!

20. Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to thee.

21. Insults have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.

22. They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

23. Let their own table before them become a snare; let their sacrificial feasts be a trap.

24. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and make their loins tremble continually.

25. Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy burning anger overtake them.

26. May their camp be a desolation, let no one dwell in their tents.

27. For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and him whom thou hast wounded, they afflict still more.

28. Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from thee.

29. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.

30. But I am afflicted and in pain; let thy salvation, O God, set me on high!

31. I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.

32. This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.

33. Let the oppressed see it and be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.

34. For the LORD hears the needy, and does not despise his own that are in bonds.

35. Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves therein.

36. For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; and his servants shall dwell there and possess it; [ (Psalms 69:37) the children of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it. ]

## Psalms 70

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering.

2. Be pleased, O God, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!

3. Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt!

4. Let them be appalled because of their shame who say, "Aha, Aha!"

5. May all who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee! May those who love thy salvation say evermore, "God is great!" [ (Psalms 70:6) But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not tarry! ]

## Psalms 71

1. In thee, O LORD, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame!

2. In thy righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline thy ear to me, and save me!

3. Be thou to me a rock of refuge, a strong fortress, to save me, for thou art my rock and my fortress.

4. Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man.

5. For thou, O Lord, art my hope, my trust, O LORD, from my youth.

6. Upon thee I have leaned from my birth; thou art he who took me from my mother's womb. My praise is continually of thee.

7. I have been as a portent to many; but thou art my strong refuge.

8. My mouth is filled with thy praise, and with thy glory all the day.

9. Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent.

10. For my enemies speak concerning me, those who watch for my life consult together,

11. and say, "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him."

12. O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!

13. May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt.

14. But I will hope continually, and will praise thee yet more and more.

15. My mouth will tell of thy righteous acts, of thy deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge.

16. With the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD I will come, I will praise thy righteousness, thine alone.

17. O God, from my youth thou hast taught me, and I still proclaim thy wondrous deeds.

18. So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, till I proclaim thy might to all the generations to come. Thy power

19. and thy righteousness, O God, reach the high heavens. Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like thee?

20. Thou who hast made me see many sore troubles wilt revive me again; from the depths of the earth thou wilt bring me up again.

21. Thou wilt increase my honor, and comfort me again.

22. I will also praise thee with the harp for thy faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to thee with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips will shout for joy, when I sing praises to thee; my soul also, which thou hast rescued.

24. And my tongue will talk of thy righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disgraced who sought to do me hurt.

## Psalms 72

1. A Psalm of Solomon.

2. Give the king thy justice, O God, and thy righteousness to the royal son!

3. May he judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with justice!

4. Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people, and the hills, in righteousness!

5. May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the needy, and crush the oppressor!

6. May he live while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations!

7. May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth!

8. In his days may righteousness flourish, and peace abound, till the moon be no more!

9. May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!

10. May his foes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust!

11. May the kings of Tarshish and of the isles render him tribute, may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts!

12. May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him!

13. For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper.

14. He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy.

15. From oppression and violence he redeems their life; and precious is their blood in his sight.

16. Long may he live, may gold of Sheba be given to him! May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all the day!

17. May there be abundance of grain in the land; on the tops of the mountains may it wave; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may men blossom forth from the cities like the grass of the field!

18. May his name endure for ever, his fame continue as long as the sun! May men bless themselves by him, all nations call him blessed!

19. Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.

20. Blessed be his glorious name for ever; may his glory fill the whole earth! Amen and Amen! [ (Psalms 72:21) The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended. ]

## Psalms 73

1. A Psalm of Asaph.

2. Truly God is good to the upright, to those who are pure in heart.

3. But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had well nigh slipped.

4. For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

5. For they have no pangs; their bodies are sound and sleek.

6. They are not in trouble as other men are; they are not stricken like other men.

7. Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment.

8. Their eyes swell out with fatness, their hearts overflow with follies.

9. They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression.

10. They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.

11. Therefore the people turn and praise them; and find no fault in them.

12. And they say, "How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"

13. Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches.

14. All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.

15. For all the day long I have been stricken, and chastened every morning.

16. If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have been untrue to the generation of thy children.

17. But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,

18. until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end.

19. Truly thou dost set them in slippery places; thou dost make them fall to ruin.

20. How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!

21. They are like a dream when one awakes, on awaking you despise their phantoms.

22. When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,

23. I was stupid and ignorant, I was like a beast toward thee.

24. Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou dost hold my right hand.

25. Thou dost guide me with thy counsel, and afterward thou wilt receive me to glory.

26. Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire besides thee.

27. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.

28. For lo, those who are far from thee shall perish; thou dost put an end to those who are false to thee. [ (Psalms 73:29) But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works. ]

## Psalms 74

1. A Maskil of Asaph.

2. O God, why dost thou cast us off for ever? Why does thy anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

3. Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thy heritage! Remember Mount Zion, where thou hast dwelt.

4. Direct thy steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary!

5. Thy foes have roared in the midst of thy holy place; they set up their own signs for signs.

6. At the upper entrance they hacked the wooden trellis with axes.

7. And then all its carved wood they broke down with hatchets and hammers.

8. They set thy sanctuary on fire; to the ground they desecrated the dwelling place of thy name.

9. They said to themselves, "We will utterly subdue them"; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.

10. We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and there is none among us who knows how long.

11. How long, O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile thy name for ever?

12. Why dost thou hold back thy hand, why dost thou keep thy right hand in thy bosom?

13. Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

14. Thou didst divide the sea by thy might; thou didst break the heads of the dragons on the waters.

15. Thou didst crush the heads of Leviathan, thou didst give him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.

16. Thou didst cleave open springs and brooks; thou didst dry up ever-flowing streams.

17. Thine is the day, thine also the night; thou hast established the luminaries and the sun.

18. Thou hast fixed all the bounds of the earth; thou hast made summer and winter.

19. Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs, and an impious people reviles thy name.

20. Do not deliver the soul of thy dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of thy poor for ever.

21. Have regard for thy covenant; for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.

22. Let not the downtrodden be put to shame; let the poor and needy praise thy name.

23. Arise, O God, plead thy cause; remember how the impious scoff at thee all the day! [ (Psalms 74:24) Do not forget the clamor of thy foes, the uproar of thy adversaries which goes up continually! ]

## Psalms 75

1. To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.

2. We give thanks to thee, O God; we give thanks; we call on thy name and recount thy wondrous deeds.

3. At the set time which I appoint I will judge with equity.

4. When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. [Selah]

5. I say to the boastful, "Do not boast," and to the wicked, "Do not lift up your horn;

6. do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with insolent neck."

7. For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up;

8. but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.

9. For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, with foaming wine, well mixed; and he will pour a draught from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.

10. But I will rejoice for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. [ (Psalms 75:11) All the horns of the wicked he will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. ]

## Psalms 76

1. To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.

2. In Judah God is known, his name is great in Israel.

3. His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.

4. There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. [Selah]

5. Glorious art thou, more majestic than the everlasting mountains.

6. The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands.

7. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay stunned.

8. But thou, terrible art thou! Who can stand before thee when once thy anger is roused?

9. From the heavens thou didst utter judgment; the earth feared and was still,

10. when God arose to establish judgment to save all the oppressed of the earth. [Selah]

11. Surely the wrath of men shall praise thee; the residue of wrath thou wilt gird upon thee.

12. Make your vows to the LORD your God, and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared, [ (Psalms 76:13) who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is terrible to the kings of the earth. ]

## Psalms 77

1. To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.

2. I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, that he may hear me.

3. In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.

4. I think of God, and I moan; I meditate, and my spirit faints. [Selah]

5. Thou dost hold my eyelids from closing; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

6. I consider the days of old, I remember the years long ago.

7. I commune with my heart in the night; I meditate and search my spirit:

8. "Will the Lord spurn for ever, and never again be favorable?

9. Has his steadfast love for ever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time?

10. Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" [Selah]

11. And I say, "It is my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed."

12. I will call to mind the deeds of the LORD; yea, I will remember thy wonders of old.

13. I will meditate on all thy work, and muse on thy mighty deeds.

14. Thy way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God?

15. Thou art the God who workest wonders, who hast manifested thy might among the peoples.

16. Thou didst with thy arm redeem thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. [Selah]

17. When the waters saw thee, O God, when the waters saw thee, they were afraid, yea, the deep trembled.

18. The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; thy arrows flashed on every side.

19. The crash of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; thy lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.

20. Thy way was through the sea, thy path through the great waters; yet thy footprints were unseen. [ (Psalms 77:21) Thou didst lead thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. ]

## Psalms 78

1. A Maskil of Asaph.

2. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth!

3. I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,

4. things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us.

5. We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders which he has wrought.

6. He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children;

7. that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children,

8. so that they should set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;

9. and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.

10. The E'phraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.

11. They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.

12. They forgot what he had done, and the miracles that he had shown them.

13. In the sight of their fathers he wrought marvels in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zo'an.

14. He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.

15. In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light.

16. He cleft rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.

17. He made streams come out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down like rivers.

18. Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.

19. They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.

20. They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?

21. He smote the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide meat for his people?"

22. Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel;

23. because they had no faith in God, and did not trust his saving power.

24. Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;

25. and he rained down upon them manna to eat, and gave them the grain of heaven.

26. Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.

27. He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;

28. he rained flesh upon them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;

29. he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their habitations.

30. And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.

31. But before they had sated their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,

32. the anger of God rose against them and he slew the strongest of them, and laid low the picked men of Israel.

33. In spite of all this they still sinned; despite his wonders they did not believe.

34. So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.

35. When he slew them, they sought for him; they repented and sought God earnestly.

36. They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.

37. But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.

38. Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not true to his covenant.

39. Yet he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often, and did not stir up all his wrath.

40. He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.

41. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!

42. They tested him again and again, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.

43. They did not keep in mind his power, or the day when he redeemed them from the foe;

44. when he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the fields of Zo'an.

45. He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.

46. He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.

47. He gave their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust.

48. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.

49. He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.

50. He let loose on them his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.

51. He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.

52. He smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.

53. Then he led forth his people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

54. He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

55. And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.

56. He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.

57. Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God, and did not observe his testimonies,

58. but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.

59. For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

60. When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.

61. He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among men,

62. and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.

63. He gave his people over to the sword, and vented his wrath on his heritage.

64. Fire devoured their young men, and their maidens had no marriage song.

65. Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.

66. Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.

67. And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.

68. He rejected the tent of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of E'phraim;

69. but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.

70. He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded for ever.

71. He chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;

72. from tending the ewes that had young he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, of Israel his inheritance. [ (Psalms 78:73) With upright heart he tended them, and guided them with skilful hand. ]

## Psalms 79

1. A Psalm of Asaph.

2. O God, the heathen have come into thy inheritance; they have defiled thy holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.

3. They have given the bodies of thy servants to the birds of the air for food, the flesh of thy saints to the beasts of the earth.

4. They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.

5. We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those round about us.

6. How long, O LORD? Wilt thou be angry for ever? Will thy jealous wrath burn like fire?

7. Pour out thy anger on the nations that do not know thee, and on the kingdoms that do not call on thy name!

8. For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.

9. Do not remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers; let thy compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.

10. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake!

11. Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of thy servants be known among the nations before our eyes!

12. Let the groans of the prisoners come before thee; according to thy great power preserve those doomed to die!

13. Return sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted thee, O Lord! [ (Psalms 79:14) Then we thy people, the flock of thy pasture, will give thanks to thee for ever; from generation to generation we will recount thy praise. ]

## Psalms 80

1. To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Testimony of Asaph. A Psalm.

2. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou who leadest Joseph like a flock! Thou who art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth

3. before E'phraim and Benjamin and Manas'seh! Stir up thy might, and come to save us!

4. Restore us, O God; let thy face shine, that we may be saved!

5. O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry with thy people's prayers?

6. Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in full measure.

7. Thou dost make us the scorn of our neighbors; and our enemies laugh among themselves.

8. Restore us, O God of hosts; let thy face shine, that we may be saved!

9. Thou didst bring a vine out of Egypt; thou didst drive out the nations and plant it.

10. Thou didst clear the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.

11. The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches;

12. it sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the River.

13. Why then hast thou broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?

14. The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.

15. Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,

16. the stock which thy right hand planted.

17. They have burned it with fire, they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance!

18. But let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself!

19. Then we will never turn back from thee; give us life, and we will call on thy name! [ (Psalms 80:20) Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! let thy face shine, that we may be saved! ]

## Psalms 81

1. To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph.

2. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob!

3. Raise a song, sound the timbrel, the sweet lyre with the harp.

4. Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.

5. For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

6. He made it a decree in Joseph, when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a voice I had not known:

7. "I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.

8. In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Mer'ibah. [Selah]

9. Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me!

10. There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.

11. I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

12. "But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would have none of me.

13. So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.

14. O that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!

15. I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their foes.

16. Those who hate the LORD would cringe toward him, and their fate would last for ever. [ (Psalms 81:17) I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you." ]

## Psalms 82

1. A Psalm of Asaph.

2. God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment:

3. "How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? [Selah]

4. Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.

5. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked."

6. They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.

7. I say, "You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you;

8. nevertheless, you shall die like men, and fall like any prince." [ (Psalms 82:9) Arise, O God, judge the earth; for to thee belong all the nations! ]

## Psalms 83

1. A Song. A Psalm of Asaph.

2. O God, do not keep silence; do not hold thy peace or be still, O God!

3. For lo, thy enemies are in tumult; those who hate thee have raised their heads.

4. They lay crafty plans against thy people; they consult together against thy protected ones.

5. They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!"

6. Yea, they conspire with one accord; against thee they make a covenant--

7. the tents of Edom and the Ish'maelites, Moab and the Hagrites,

8. Gebal and Ammon and Am'alek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

9. Assyria also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. [Selah]

10. Do to them as thou didst to Mid'ian, as to Sis'era and Jabin at the river Kishon,

11. who were destroyed at En-dor, who became dung for the ground.

12. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmun'na,

13. who said, "Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God."

14. O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind.

15. As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,

16. so do thou pursue them with thy tempest and terrify them with thy hurricane!

17. Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O LORD.

18. Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; let them perish in disgrace. [ (Psalms 83:19) Let them know that thou alone, whose name is the LORD, art the Most High over all the earth. ]

## Psalms 84

1. To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.

2. How lovely is thy dwelling place, O LORD of hosts!

3. My soul longs, yea, faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.

4. Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at thy altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.

5. Blessed are those who dwell in thy house, ever singing thy praise! [Selah]

6. Blessed are the men whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.

7. As they go through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; the early rain also covers it with pools.

8. They go from strength to strength; the God of gods will be seen in Zion.

9. O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! [Selah]

10. Behold our shield, O God; look upon the face of thine anointed!

11. For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

12. For the LORD God is a sun and shield; he bestows favor and honor. No good thing does the LORD withhold from those who walk uprightly. [ (Psalms 84:13) O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in thee! ]

## Psalms 85

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.

2. LORD, thou wast favorable to thy land; thou didst restore the fortunes of Jacob.

3. Thou didst forgive the iniquity of thy people; thou didst pardon all their sin. [Selah]

4. Thou didst withdraw all thy wrath; thou didst turn from thy hot anger.

5. Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away thy indignation toward us!

6. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou prolong thy anger to all generations?

7. Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?

8. Show us thy steadfast love, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

9. Let me hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints, to those who turn to him in their hearts.

10. Surely his salvation is at hand for those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.

11. Steadfast love and faithfulness will meet; righteousness and peace will kiss each other.

12. Faithfulness will spring up from the ground, and righteousness will look down from the sky.

13. Yea, the LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase. [ (Psalms 85:14) Righteousness will go before him, and make his footsteps a way. ]

## Psalms 86

1. A Prayer of David.

2. Incline thy ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.

3. Preserve my life, for I am godly; save thy servant who trusts in thee. Thou art my God;

4. be gracious to me, O Lord, for to thee do I cry all the day.

5. Gladden the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

6. For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call on thee.

7. Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; hearken to my cry of supplication.

8. In the day of my trouble I call on thee, for thou dost answer me.

9. There is none like thee among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like thine.

10. All the nations thou hast made shall come and bow down before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.

11. For thou art great and doest wondrous things, thou alone art God.

12. Teach me thy way, O LORD, that I may walk in thy truth; unite my heart to fear thy name.

13. I give thanks to thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify thy name for ever.

14. For great is thy steadfast love toward me; thou hast delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.

15. O God, insolent men have risen up against me; a band of ruthless men seek my life, and they do not set thee before them.

16. But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.

17. Turn to me and take pity on me; give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid. [ (Psalms 86:18) Show me a sign of thy favor, that those who hate me may see and be put to shame because thou, LORD, hast helped me and comforted me. ]

## Psalms 87

1. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. A Song.

2. On the holy mount stands the city he founded;

3. the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.

4. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. [Selah]

5. Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia-- "This one was born there," they say.

6. And of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; for the Most High himself will establish her.

7. The LORD records as he registers the peoples, "This one was born there." [Selah] [ (Psalms 87:8) Singers and dancers alike say, "All my springs are in you." ]

## Psalms 88

1. A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. To the choirmaster: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.

2. O LORD, my God, I call for help by day; I cry out in the night before thee.

3. Let my prayer come before thee, incline thy ear to my cry!

4. For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.

5. I am reckoned among those who go down to the Pit; I am a man who has no strength,

6. like one forsaken among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom thou dost remember no more, for they are cut off from thy hand.

7. Thou hast put me in the depths of the Pit, in the regions dark and deep.

8. Thy wrath lies heavy upon me, and thou dost overwhelm me with all thy waves. [Selah]

9. Thou hast caused my companions to shun me; thou hast made me a thing of horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape;

10. my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call upon thee, O LORD; I spread out my hands to thee.

11. Dost thou work wonders for the dead? Do the shades rise up to praise thee? [Selah]

12. Is thy steadfast love declared in the grave, or thy faithfulness in Abaddon?

13. Are thy wonders known in the darkness, or thy saving help in the land of forgetfulness?

14. But I, O LORD, cry to thee; in the morning my prayer comes before thee.

15. O LORD, why dost thou cast me off? Why dost thou hide thy face from me?

16. Afflicted and close to death from my youth up, I suffer thy terrors; I am helpless.

17. Thy wrath has swept over me; thy dread assaults destroy me.

18. They surround me like a flood all day long; they close in upon me together. [ (Psalms 88:19) Thou hast caused lover and friend to shun me; my companions are in darkness. ]

## Psalms 89

1. A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

2. I will sing of thy steadfast love, O LORD, for ever; with my mouth I will proclaim thy faithfulness to all generations.

3. For thy steadfast love was established for ever, thy faithfulness is firm as the heavens.

4. Thou hast said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant:

5. `your descendants for ever, and build your throne for all generations.'" [Selah]

6. Let the heavens praise thy wonders, O LORD, thy faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!

7. For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD,

8. a God feared in the council of the holy ones, great and terrible above all that are round about him?

9. O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as thou art, O LORD, with thy faithfulness round about thee?

10. Thou dost rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, thou stillest them.

11. Thou didst crush Rahab like a carcass, thou didst scatter thy enemies with thy mighty arm.

12. The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; the world and all that is in it, thou hast founded them.

13. The north and the south, thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise thy name.

14. Thou hast a mighty arm; strong is thy hand, high thy right hand.

15. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before thee.

16. Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance,

17. who exult in thy name all the day, and extol thy righteousness.

18. For thou art the glory of their strength; by thy favor our horn is exalted.

19. For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.

20. Of old thou didst speak in a vision to thy faithful one, and say: "I have set the crown upon one who is mighty, I have exalted one chosen from the people.

21. I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him;

22. so that my hand shall ever abide with him, my arm also shall strengthen him.

23. The enemy shall not outwit him, the wicked shall not humble him.

24. I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.

25. My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.

26. I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.

27. He shall cry to me, `ou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.'

28. And I will make him the first-born, the highest of the kings of the earth.

29. My steadfast love I will keep for him for ever, and my covenant will stand firm for him.

30. I will establish his line for ever and his throne as the days of the heavens.

31. If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my ordinances,

32. if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,

33. then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with scourges;

34. but I will not remove from him my steadfast love, or be false to my faithfulness.

35. I will not violate my covenant, or alter the word that went forth from my lips.

36. Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.

37. His line shall endure for ever, his throne as long as the sun before me.

38. Like the moon it shall be established for ever; it shall stand firm while the skies endure." [Selah]

39. But now thou hast cast off and rejected, thou art full of wrath against thy anointed.

40. Thou hast renounced the covenant with thy servant; thou hast defiled his crown in the dust.

41. Thou hast breached all his walls; thou hast laid his strongholds in ruins.

42. All that pass by despoil him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.

43. Thou hast exalted the right hand of his foes; thou hast made all his enemies rejoice.

44. Yea, thou hast turned back the edge of his sword, and thou hast not made him stand in battle.

45. Thou hast removed the scepter from his hand, and cast his throne to the ground.

46. Thou hast cut short the days of his youth; thou hast covered him with shame. [Selah]

47. How long, O LORD? Wilt thou hide thyself for ever? How long will thy wrath burn like fire?

48. Remember, O Lord, what the measure of life is, for what vanity thou hast created all the sons of men!

49. What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? [Selah]

50. Lord, where is thy steadfast love of old, which by thy faithfulness thou didst swear to David?

51. Remember, O Lord, how thy servant is scorned; how I bear in my bosom the insults of the peoples,

52. with which thy enemies taunt, O LORD, with which they mock the footsteps of thy anointed. [ (Psalms 89:53) Blessed be the LORD for ever! Amen and Amen. ]

## Psalms 90

1. A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.

2. LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

3. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.

4. Thou turnest man back to the dust, and sayest, "Turn back, O children of men!"

5. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.

6. Thou dost sweep men away; they are like a dream, like grass which is renewed in the morning:

7. in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers.

8. For we are consumed by thy anger; by thy wrath we are overwhelmed.

9. Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.

10. For all our days pass away under thy wrath, our years come to an end like a sigh.

11. The years of our life are threescore and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away.

12. Who considers the power of thy anger, and thy wrath according to the fear of thee?

13. So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.

14. Return, O LORD! How long? Have pity on thy servants!

15. Satisfy us in the morning with thy steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

16. Make us glad as many days as thou hast afflicted us, and as many years as we have seen evil.

17. Let thy work be manifest to thy servants, and thy glorious power to their children. [ (Psalms 90:18) Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. ]

## Psalms 91

1. He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, who abides in the shadow of the Almighty,

2. will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust."

3. For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence;

4. he will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.

5. You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,

6. nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.

7. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you.

8. You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked.

9. Because you have made the LORD your refuge, the Most High your habitation,

10. no evil shall befall you, no scourge come near your tent.

11. For he will give his angels charge of you to guard you in all your ways.

12. On their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.

13. You will tread on the lion and the adder, the young lion and the serpent you will trample under foot.

14. Because he cleaves to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.

15. When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will rescue him and honor him.

16. With long life I will satisfy him, and show him my salvation.

## Psalms 92

1. A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath.

2. It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to thy name, O Most High;

3. to declare thy steadfast love in the morning, and thy faithfulness by night,

4. to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.

5. For thou, O LORD, hast made me glad by thy work; at the works of thy hands I sing for joy.

6. How great are thy works, O LORD! Thy thoughts are very deep!

7. The dull man cannot know, the stupid cannot understand this:

8. that, though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction for ever,

9. but thou, O LORD, art on high for ever.

10. For, lo, thy enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thy enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.

11. But thou hast exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; thou hast poured over me fresh oil.

12. My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies, my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.

13. The righteous flourish like the palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

14. They are planted in the house of the LORD, they flourish in the courts of our God.

15. They still bring forth fruit in old age, they are ever full of sap and green, [ (Psalms 92:16) to show that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. ]

## Psalms 93

1. The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed, he is girded with strength. Yea, the world is established; it shall never be moved;

2. thy throne is established from of old; thou art from everlasting.

3. The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice, the floods lift up their roaring.

4. Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty!

5. Thy decrees are very sure; holiness befits thy house, O LORD, for evermore.

## Psalms 94

1. O LORD, thou God of vengeance, thou God of vengeance, shine forth!

2. Rise up, O judge of the earth; render to the proud their deserts!

3. O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?

4. They pour out their arrogant words, they boast, all the evildoers.

5. They crush thy people, O LORD, and afflict thy heritage.

6. They slay the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;

7. and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive."

8. Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?

9. He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?

10. He who chastens the nations, does he not chastise? He who teaches men knowledge,

11. the LORD, knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.

12. Blessed is the man whom thou dost chasten, O LORD, and whom thou dost teach out of thy law

13. to give him respite from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.

14. For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;

15. for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.

16. Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?

17. If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have dwelt in the land of silence.

18. When I thought, "My foot slips," thy steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.

19. When the cares of my heart are many, thy consolations cheer my soul.

20. Can wicked rulers be allied with thee, who frame mischief by statute?

21. They band together against the life of the righteous, and condemn the innocent to death.

22. But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.

23. He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.

## Psalms 95

1. O come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!

2. Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!

3. For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

4. In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.

5. The sea is his, for he made it; for his hands formed the dry land.

6. O come, let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker!

7. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. O that today you would hearken to his voice!

8. Harden not your hearts, as at Mer'ibah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,

9. when your fathers tested me, and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.

10. For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people who err in heart, and they do not regard my ways."

11. Therefore I swore in my anger that they should not enter my rest.

## Psalms 96

1. O sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth!

2. Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.

3. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!

4. For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.

5. For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but the LORD made the heavens.

6. Honor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

7. Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength!

8. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts!

9. Worship the LORD in holy array; tremble before him, all the earth!

10. Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns! Yea, the world is established, it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity."

11. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it;

12. let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy

13. before the LORD, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.

## Psalms 97

1. The LORD reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!

2. Clouds and thick darkness are round about him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

3. Fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about.

4. His lightnings lighten the world; the earth sees and trembles.

5. The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.

6. The heavens proclaim his righteousness; and all the peoples behold his glory.

7. All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; all gods bow down before him.

8. Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of thy judgments, O God.

9. For thou, O LORD, art most high over all the earth; thou art exalted far above all gods.

10. The LORD loves those who hate evil; he preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

11. Light dawns for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.

12. Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name!

## Psalms 98

1. A Psalm.

2. O sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand and his holy arm have gotten him victory.

3. The LORD has made known his victory, he has revealed his vindication in the sight of the nations.

4. He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.

5. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth into joyous song and sing praises!

6. Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody!

7. With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD!

8. Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who dwell in it!

9. Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together [ (Psalms 98:10) before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity. ]

## Psalms 99

1. The LORD reigns; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake!

2. The LORD is great in Zion; he is exalted over all the peoples.

3. Let them praise thy great and terrible name! Holy is he!

4. Mighty King, lover of justice, thou hast established equity; thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.

5. Extol the LORD our God; worship at his footstool! Holy is he!

6. Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel also was among those who called on his name. They cried to the LORD, and he answered them.

7. He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies, and the statutes that he gave them.

8. O LORD our God, thou didst answer them; thou wast a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings.

9. Extol the LORD our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the LORD our God is holy!

## Psalms 100

1. A Psalm for the thank offering.

2. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the lands!

3. Serve the LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!

## Psalms 101

1. A Psalm of David.

2. I will sing of loyalty and of justice; to thee, O LORD, I will sing.

3. I will give heed to the way that is blameless. Oh when wilt thou come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house;

4. I will not set before my eyes anything that is base. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cleave to me.

5. Perverseness of heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil.

6. Him who slanders his neighbor secretly I will destroy. The man of haughty looks and arrogant heart I will not endure.

7. I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me.

8. No man who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no man who utters lies shall continue in my presence. [ (Psalms 101:9) Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land, cutting off all the evildoers from the city of the LORD. ]

## Psalms 102

1. A prayer of one afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the LORD.

2. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to thee!

3. Do not hide thy face from me in the day of my distress! Incline thy ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call!

4. For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.

5. My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; I forget to eat my bread.

6. Because of my loud groaning my bones cleave to my flesh.

7. I am like a vulture of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places;

8. I lie awake, I am like a lonely bird on the housetop.

9. All the day my enemies taunt me, those who deride me use my name for a curse.

10. For I eat ashes like bread, and mingle tears with my drink,

11. because of thy indignation and anger; for thou hast taken me up and thrown me away.

12. My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass.

13. But thou, O LORD, art enthroned for ever; thy name endures to all generations.

14. Thou wilt arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come.

15. For thy servants hold her stones dear, and have pity on her dust.

16. The nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

17. For the LORD will build up Zion, he will appear in his glory;

18. he will regard the prayer of the destitute, and will not despise their supplication.

19. Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet unborn may praise the LORD:

20. that he looked down from his holy height, from heaven the LORD looked at the earth,

21. to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die;

22. that men may declare in Zion the name of the LORD, and in Jerusalem his praise,

23. when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the LORD.

24. He has broken my strength in mid-course; he has shortened my days.

25. "O my God," I say, "take me not hence in the midst of my days, thou whose years endure throughout all generations!"

26. Of old thou didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.

27. They will perish, but thou dost endure; they will all wear out like a garment. Thou changest them like raiment, and they pass away;

28. but thou art the same, and thy years have no end. [ (Psalms 102:29) The children of thy servants shall dwell secure; their posterity shall be established before thee. ]

## Psalms 103

1. A Psalm of David.

2. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name!

3. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,

4. who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases,

5. who redeems your life from the Pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,

6. who satisfies you with good as long as you live so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.

7. The LORD works vindication and justice for all who are oppressed.

8. He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel.

9. The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.

10. He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger for ever.

11. He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor requite us according to our iniquities.

12. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;

13. as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.

14. As a father pities his children, so the LORD pities those who fear him.

15. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.

16. As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field;

17. for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.

18. But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children,

19. to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.

20. The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.

21. Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word!

22. Bless the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will! [ (Psalms 103:23) Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul! ]

## Psalms 104

1. Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, thou art very great! Thou art clothed with honor and majesty,

2. who coverest thyself with light as with a garment, who hast stretched out the heavens like a tent,

3. who hast laid the beams of thy chambers on the waters, who makest the clouds thy chariot, who ridest on the wings of the wind,

4. who makest the winds thy messengers, fire and flame thy ministers.

5. Thou didst set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be shaken.

6. Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.

7. At thy rebuke they fled; at the sound of thy thunder they took to flight.

8. The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place which thou didst appoint for them.

9. Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth.

10. Thou makest springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills,

11. they give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.

12. By them the birds of the air have their habitation; they sing among the branches.

13. From thy lofty abode thou waterest the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy work.

14. Thou dost cause the grass to grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth,

15. and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread to strengthen man's heart.

16. The trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon which he planted.

17. In them the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees.

18. The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the badgers.

19. Thou hast made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.

20. Thou makest darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep forth.

21. The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.

22. When the sun rises, they get them away and lie down in their dens.

23. Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.

24. O LORD, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy creatures.

25. Yonder is the sea, great and wide, which teems with things innumerable, living things both small and great.

26. There go the ships, and Leviathan which thou didst form to sport in it.

27. These all look to thee, to give them their food in due season.

28. When thou givest to them, they gather it up; when thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good things.

29. When thou hidest thy face, they are dismayed; when thou takest away their breath, they die and return to their dust.

30. When thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground.

31. May the glory of the LORD endure for ever, may the LORD rejoice in his works,

32. who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke!

33. I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.

34. May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the LORD.

35. Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise the LORD!

## Psalms 105

1. O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the peoples!

2. Sing to him, sing praises to him, tell of all his wonderful works!

3. Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!

4. Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his presence continually!

5. Remember the wonderful works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,

6. O offspring of Abraham his servant, sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!

7. He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

8. He is mindful of his covenant for ever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,

9. the covenant which he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,

10. which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,

11. saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."

12. When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,

13. wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,

14. he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,

15. saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"

16. When he summoned a famine on the land, and broke every staff of bread,

17. he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.

18. His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron;

19. until what he had said came to pass the word of the LORD tested him.

20. The king sent and released him, the ruler of the peoples set him free;

21. he made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions,

22. to instruct his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.

23. Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24. And the LORD made his people very fruitful, and made them stronger than their foes.

25. He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.

26. He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.

27. They wrought his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they rebelled against his words.

29. He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die.

30. Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.

31. He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.

32. He gave them hail for rain, and lightning that flashed through their land.

33. He smote their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.

34. He spoke, and the locusts came, and young locusts without number;

35. which devoured all the vegetation in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.

36. He smote all the first-born in their land, the first issue of all their strength.

37. Then he led forth Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.

38. Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.

39. He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.

40. They asked, and he brought quails, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.

41. He opened the rock, and water gushed forth; it flowed through the desert like a river.

42. For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

43. So he led forth his people with joy, his chosen ones with singing.

44. And he gave them the lands of the nations; and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil,

45. to the end that they should keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!

## Psalms 106

1. Praise the LORD! O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever!

2. Who can utter the mighty doings of the LORD, or show forth all his praise?

3. Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!

4. Remember me, O LORD, when thou showest favor to thy people; help me when thou deliverest them;

5. that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy heritage.

6. Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

7. Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider thy wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of thy steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High at the Red Sea.

8. Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power.

9. He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; and he led them through the deep as through a desert.

10. So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the power of the enemy.

11. And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.

12. Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.

13. But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.

14. But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;

15. he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.

16. When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,

17. the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abi'ram.

18. Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

19. They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a molten image.

20. They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.

21. They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,

22. wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea.

23. Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.

24. Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.

25. They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD.

26. Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,

27. and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them over the lands.

28. Then they attached themselves to the Ba'al of Pe'or, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;

29. they provoked the LORD to anger with their doings, and a plague broke out among them.

30. Then Phin'ehas stood up and interposed, and the plague was stayed.

31. And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation for ever.

32. They angered him at the waters of Mer'ibah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;

33. for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash.

34. They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,

35. but they mingled with the nations and learned to do as they did.

36. They served their idols, which became a snare to them.

37. They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;

38. they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.

39. Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the harlot in their doings.

40. Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;

41. he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.

42. Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.

43. Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes, and were brought low through their iniquity.

44. Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.

45. He remembered for their sake his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.

46. He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.

47. Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise.

48. Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD!

## Psalms 107

1. O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever!

2. Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble

3. and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.

4. Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in;

5. hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.

6. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;

7. he led them by a straight way, till they reached a city to dwell in.

8. Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

9. For he satisfies him who is thirsty, and the hungry he fills with good things.

10. Some sat in darkness and in gloom, prisoners in affliction and in irons,

11. for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.

12. Their hearts were bowed down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.

13. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;

14. he brought them out of darkness and gloom, and broke their bonds asunder.

15. Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

16. For he shatters the doors of bronze, and cuts in two the bars of iron.

17. Some were sick through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;

18. they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.

19. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;

20. he sent forth his word, and healed them, and delivered them from destruction.

21. Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

22. And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!

23. Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters;

24. they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep.

25. For he commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.

26. They mounted up to heaven, they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight;

27. they reeled and staggered like drunken men, and were at their wits' end.

28. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;

29. he made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.

30. Then they were glad because they had quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.

31. Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

32. Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.

33. He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,

34. a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.

35. He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.

36. And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in;

37. they sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get a fruitful yield.

38. By his blessing they multiply greatly; and he does not let their cattle decrease.

39. When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,

40. he pours contempt upon princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;

41. but he raises up the needy out of affliction, and makes their families like flocks.

42. The upright see it and are glad; and all wickedness stops its mouth.

43. Whoever is wise, let him give heed to these things; let men consider the steadfast love of the LORD.

## Psalms 108

1. A Song. A Psalm of David.

2. My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody! Awake, my soul!

3. Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!

4. I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the peoples, I will sing praises to thee among the nations.

5. For thy steadfast love is great above the heavens, thy faithfulness reaches to the clouds.

6. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let thy glory be over all the earth!

7. That thy beloved may be delivered, give help by thy right hand, and answer me!

8. God has promised in his sanctuary: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the Vale of Succoth.

9. Gilead is mine; Manas'seh is mine; E'phraim is my helmet; Judah my scepter.

10. Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph."

11. Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

12. Hast thou not rejected us, O God? Thou dost not go forth, O God, with our armies.

13. O grant us help against the foe, for vain is the help of man! [ (Psalms 108:14) With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes. ]

## Psalms 109

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. Be not silent, O God of my praise!

3. For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues.

4. They beset me with words of hate, and attack me without cause.

5. In return for my love they accuse me, even as I make prayer for them.

6. So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

7. Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser bring him to trial.

8. When he is tried, let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin!

9. May his days be few; may another seize his goods!

10. May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow!

11. May his children wander about and beg; may they be driven out of the ruins they inhabit!

12. May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!

13. Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor any to pity his fatherless children!

14. May his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation!

15. May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!

16. Let them be before the LORD continually; and may his memory be cut off from the earth!

17. For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted to their death.

18. He loved to curse; let curses come on him! He did not like blessing; may it be far from him!

19. He clothed himself with cursing as his coat, may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones!

20. May it be like a garment which he wraps round him, like a belt with which he daily girds himself!

21. May this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, of those who speak evil against my life!

22. But thou, O GOD my Lord, deal on my behalf for thy name's sake; because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me!

23. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is stricken within me.

24. I am gone, like a shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust.

25. My knees are weak through fasting; my body has become gaunt.

26. I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they wag their heads.

27. Help me, O LORD my God! Save me according to thy steadfast love!

28. Let them know that this is thy hand; thou, O LORD, hast done it!

29. Let them curse, but do thou bless! Let my assailants be put to shame; may thy servant be glad!

30. May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a mantle!

31. With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD; I will praise him in the midst of the throng. [ (Psalms 109:32) For he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who condemn him to death. ]

## Psalms 110

1. A Psalm of David.

2. The LORD says to my lord: "Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool."

3. The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your foes!

4. Your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host upon the holy mountains. From the womb of the morning like dew your youth will come to you.

5. The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, "You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchiz'edek."

6. The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath.

7. He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter chiefs over the wide earth. [ (Psalms 110:8) He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head. ]

## Psalms 111

1. Prasie the LORD. I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart, in the company of the upright, in the congregation.

10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all those who practice it. His praise endures for ever!

2. His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.

3. Wealth and riches are in his house; and his righteousness endures for ever.

4. Light rises in the darkness for the upright; the LORD is gracious, merciful, and righteous.

5. It is well with the man who deals generously and lends, who conducts his affairs with justice.

6. For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered for ever.

7. He is not afraid of evil tidings; his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.

8. His heart is steady, he will not be afraid, until he sees his desire on his adversaries.

9. He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever; his horn is exalted in honor.

10. The wicked man sees it and is angry; he gnashes his teeth and melts away; the desire of the wicked man comes to nought.

## Psalms 113

4. The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens!

5. Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high,

6. who looks far down upon the heavens and the earth?

7. He raises the poor from the dust, and lifts the needy from the ash heap,

8. to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people.

7. Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

8. who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.

## Psalms 115

1. Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to thy name give glory, for the sake of thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness!

2. Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"

3. Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases.

4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

5. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.

6. They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell.

7. They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat.

8. It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to put confidence in man.

9. It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.

10. All nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I cut them off!

11. They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side; in the name of the LORD I cut them off!

12. They surrounded me like bees, they blazed like a fire of thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off!

13. I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the LORD helped me.

14. The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.

15. Hark, glad songs of victory in the tents of the righteous: "The right hand of the LORD does valiantly,

16. the right hand of the LORD is exalted, the right hand of the LORD does valiantly!"

9. who in thy midst, O Egypt, sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants;

10. who smote many nations and slew mighty kings,

11. Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,

12. and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel.

13. Thy name, O LORD, endures for ever, thy renown, O LORD, throughout all ages.

14. For the LORD will vindicate his people, and have compassion on his servants.

15. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

16. They have mouths, but they speak not, they have eyes, but they see not,

17. they have ears, but they hear not, nor is there any breath in their mouths.

18. Like them be those who make them!-- yea, every one who trusts in them!

19. O house of Israel, bless the LORD! O house of Aaron, bless the LORD!

## Psalms 137

1. By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion.

2. On the willows there we hung up our lyres.

3. For there our captors required of us songs, and our tormentors, mirth, saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"

4. How shall we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land?

5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither!

6. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy!

7. Remember, O LORD, against the E'domites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, "Rase it, rase it! Down to its foundations!"

4. On the day I called, thou didst answer me, my strength of soul thou didst increase.

5. All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, for they have heard the words of thy mouth;

6. and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, for great is the glory of the LORD.

7. For though the LORD is high, he regards the lowly; but the haughty he knows from afar.

8. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou dost preserve my life; thou dost stretch out thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand delivers me. [ (Psalms 138:9) The LORD will fulfil his purpose for me; thy steadfast love, O LORD, endures for ever. Do not forsake the work of thy hands. ]

## Psalms 139

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

2. O LORD, thou hast searched me and known me!

3. Thou knowest when I sit down and when I rise up; thou discernest my thoughts from afar.

4. Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.

5. Even before a word is on my tongue, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.

6. Thou dost beset me behind and before, and layest thy hand upon me.

7. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain it.

8. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?

9. If I ascend to heaven, thou art there! If I make my bed in Sheol, thou art there!

10. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,

11. even there thy hand shall lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

12. If I say, "Let only darkness cover me, and the light about me be night,"

13. even the darkness is not dark to thee, the night is bright as the day; for darkness is as light with thee.

14. For thou didst form my inward parts, thou didst knit me together in my mother's womb.

15. I praise thee, for thou art fearful and wonderful. Wonderful are thy works! Thou knowest me right well;

16. my frame was not hidden from thee, when I was being made in secret, intricately wrought in the depths of the earth.

17. Thy eyes beheld my unformed substance; in thy book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.

18. How precious to me are thy thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!

19. If I would count them, they are more than the sand. When I awake, I am still with thee.

20. O that thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God, and that men of blood would depart from me,

21. men who maliciously defy thee, who lift themselves up against thee for evil!

22. Do I not hate them that hate thee, O LORD? And do I not loathe them that rise up against thee?

23. I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies.

24. Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! [ (Psalms 139:25) And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting! ]

## Psalms 140

1. To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

5. Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from violent men, who have planned to trip up my feet.

6. Arrogant men have hidden a trap for me, and with cords they have spread a net, by the wayside they have set snares for me. [Selah]

7. I say to the LORD, Thou art my God; give ear to the voice of my supplications, O LORD!

8. O LORD, my Lord, my strong deliverer, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

9. Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not further his evil plot! [Selah]

10. Those who surround me lift up their head, let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them!

11. Let burning coals fall upon them! Let them be cast into pits, no more to rise!

12. Let not the slanderer be established in the land; let evil hunt down the violent man speedily!

## Psalms 141

1. A Psalm of David.

2. I call upon thee, O LORD; make haste to me! Give ear to my voice, when I call to thee!

3. Let my prayer be counted as incense before thee, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice!

4. Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD, keep watch over the door of my lips!

5. Incline not my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties!

6. Let a good man strike or rebuke me in kindness, but let the oil of the wicked never anoint my head; for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.

7. When they are given over to those who shall condemn them, then they shall learn that the word of the LORD is true.

8. As a rock which one cleaves and shatters on the land, so shall their bones be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.

9. But my eyes are toward thee, O LORD God; in thee I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!

10. Keep me from the trap which they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers! [ (Psalms 141:11) Let the wicked together fall into their own nets, while I escape. ]

## Psalms 142

1. A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.

2. I cry with my voice to the LORD, with my voice I make supplication to the LORD,

3. I pour out my complaint before him, I tell my trouble before him.

4. When my spirit is faint, thou knowest my way! In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.

5. I look to the right and watch, but there is none who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me, no man cares for me.

6. I cry to thee, O LORD; I say, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.

7. Give heed to my cry; for I am brought very low! Deliver me from my persecutors; for they are too strong for me! [ (Psalms 142:8) Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to thy name! The righteous will surround me; for thou wilt deal bountifully with me. ]

## Psalms 143

1. A Psalm of David.

2. Hear my prayer, O LORD; give ear to my supplications! In thy faithfulness answer me, in thy righteousness!

3. Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for no man living is righteous before thee.

4. For the enemy has pursued me; he has crushed my life to the ground; he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.

5. Therefore my spirit faints within me; my heart within me is appalled.

6. I remember the days of old, I meditate on all that thou hast done; I muse on what thy hands have wrought.

7. I stretch out my hands to thee; my soul thirsts for thee like a parched land. [Selah]

8. Make haste to answer me, O LORD! My spirit fails! Hide not thy face from me, lest I be like those who go down to the Pit.

9. Let me hear in the morning of thy steadfast love, for in thee I put my trust. Teach me the way I should go, for to thee I lift up my soul.

10. Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies! I have fled to thee for refuge!

11. Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God! Let thy good spirit lead me on a level path!

4. O LORD, what is man that thou dost regard him, or the son of man that thou dost think of him?

5. Man is like a breath, his days are like a passing shadow.

6. Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down! Touch the mountains that they smoke!

7. Flash forth the lightning and scatter them, send out thy arrows and rout them!

8. Stretch forth thy hand from on high, rescue me and deliver me from the many waters, from the hand of aliens,

9. whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

10. I will sing a new song to thee, O God; upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to thee,

11. who givest victory to kings, who rescuest David thy servant.

12. Rescue me from the cruel sword, and deliver me from the hand of aliens, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

13. May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, our daughters like corner pillars cut for the structure of a palace;

14. may our garners be full, providing all manner of store; may our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;

15. may our cattle be heavy with young, suffering no mischance or failure in bearing; may there be no cry of distress in our streets! [ (Psalms 144:16) Happy the people to whom such blessings fall! Happy the people whose God is the LORD! ]
