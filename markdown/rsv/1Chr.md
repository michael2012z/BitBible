## 1 Chronicles 10

1. Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilbo'a.

2. And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abin'adab and Mal'chishu'a, the sons of Saul.

3. The battle pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him; and he was wounded by the archers.

4. Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and make sport of me." But his armor-bearer would not; for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it.

5. And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died.

6. Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.

7. And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

8. On the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilbo'a.

9. And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.

10. And they put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

11. But when all Ja'besh-gil'ead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,

12. all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

13. So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance,

14. and did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD slew him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.

## 1 Chronicles 11

1. Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron, and said, "Behold, we are your bone and flesh.

2. In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you that led out and brought in Israel; and the LORD your God said to you, `You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.'"

3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.

4. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is Jebus, where the Jeb'usites were, the inhabitants of the land.

5. The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.

6. David said, "Whoever shall smite the Jeb'usites first shall be chief and commander." And Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah went up first, so he became chief.

7. And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.

8. And he built the city round about from the Millo in complete circuit; and Jo'ab repaired the rest of the city.

9. And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.

10. Now these are the chiefs of David's mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.

11. This is an account of David's mighty men: Jasho'be-am, a Hach'monite, was chief of the three; he wielded his spear against three hundred whom he slew at one time.

12. And next to him among the three mighty men was Elea'zar the son of Dodo, the Aho'hite.

13. He was with David at Pas-dam'mim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.

14. But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great victory.

15. Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Reph'aim.

16. David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.

17. And David said longingly, "O that some one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!"

18. Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took and brought it to David. But David would not drink of it; he poured it out to the LORD,

19. and said, "Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.

20. Now Abi'shai, the brother of Jo'ab, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and slew them, and won a name beside the three.

21. He was the most renowned of the thirty, and became their commander; but he did not attain to the three.

22. And Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds; he smote two ariels of Moab. He also went down and slew a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.

23. And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam; but Benai'ah went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

24. These things did Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and won a name beside the three mighty men.

25. He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.

26. The mighty men of the armies were As'ahel the brother of Jo'ab, Elha'nan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

27. Shammoth of Harod, Helez the Pel'onite,

28. Ira the son of Ikkesh of Teko'a, Abi-e'zer of An'athoth,

47. Eli'el, and Obed, and Ja-asi'el the Mezo'ba-ite.

## 1 Chronicles 12

1. Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not move about freely because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men who helped him in war.

2. They were bowmen, and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the right or the left hand; they were Benjaminites, Saul's kinsmen.

15. These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.

16. And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.

17. David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be knit to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you."

18. Then the Spirit came upon Ama'sai, chief of the thirty, and he said, "We are yours, O David; and with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers! For your God helps you." Then David received them, and made them officers of his troops.

19. Some of the men of Manas'seh deserted to David when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, "At peril to our heads he will desert to his master Saul.")

20. As he went to Ziklag these men of Manas'seh deserted to him: Adnah, Joz'abad, Jedi'a-el, Michael, Joz'abad, Eli'hu, and Zil'lethai, chiefs of thousands in Manas'seh.

21. They helped David against the band of raiders; for they were all mighty men of valor, and were commanders in the army.

22. For from day to day men kept coming to David to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God.

23. These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops, who came to David in Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the LORD.

24. The men of Judah bearing shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred armed troops.

25. Of the Simeonites, mighty men of valor for war, seven thousand one hundred.

26. Of the Levites four thousand six hundred.

27. The prince Jehoi'ada, of the house of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred.

28. Zadok, a young man mighty in valor, and twenty-two commanders from his own father's house.

29. Of the Benjaminites, the kinsmen of Saul, three thousand, of whom the majority had hitherto kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.

30. Of the E'phraimites twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers' houses.

31. Of the half-tribe of Manas'seh eighteen thousand, who were expressly named to come and make David king.

32. Of Is'sachar men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, two hundred chiefs, and all their kinsmen under their command.

33. Of Zeb'ulun fifty thousand seasoned troops, equipped for battle with all the weapons of war, to help David with singleness of purpose.

34. Of Naph'tali a thousand commanders with whom were thirty-seven thousand men armed with shield and spear.

35. Of the Danites twenty-eight thousand six hundred men equipped for battle.

36. Of Asher forty thousand seasoned troops ready for battle.

37. Of the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh from beyond the Jordan, one hundred and twenty thousand men armed with all the weapons of war.

38. All these, men of war, arrayed in battle order, came to Hebron with full intent to make David king over all Israel; likewise all the rest of Israel were of a single mind to make David king.

39. And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had made preparation for them.

40. And also their neighbors, from as far as Is'sachar and Zeb'ulun and Naph'tali, came bringing food on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant provisions of meal, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.

## 1 Chronicles 13

1. David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.

2. And David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if it is the will of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brethren who remain in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites in the cities that have pasture lands, that they may come together to us.

3. Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we neglected it in the days of Saul."

4. All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

5. So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kir'iath-je'arim.

6. And David and all Israel went up to Ba'alah, that is, to Kir'iath-je'arim which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD who sits enthroned above the cherubim.

7. And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, from the house of Abin'adab, and Uzzah and Ahi'o were driving the cart.

8. And David and all Israel were making merry before God with all their might, with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.

9. And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.

10. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and he smote him because he put forth his hand to the ark; and he died there before God.

11. And David was angry because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah; and that place is called Pe'rez-uz'za to this day.

12. And David was afraid of God that day; and he said, "How can I bring the ark of God home to me?"

13. So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house of O'bed-e'dom the Gittite.

14. And the ark of God remained with the household of O'bed-e'dom in his house three months; and the LORD blessed the household of O'bed-e'dom and all that he had.

## 1 Chronicles 14

1. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also masons and carpenters to build a house for him.

2. And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.

3. And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.

4. These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammu'a, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

5. Ibhar, Eli'shu-a, El'pelet,

6. Nogah, Nepheg, Japhi'a,

7. Eli'shama, Beeli'ada, and Eliph'elet.

8. When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them.

9. Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Reph'aim.

10. And David inquired of God, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into my hand?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up, and I will give them into your hand."

11. And he went up to Ba'al-pera'zim, and David defeated them there; and David said, "God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood." Therefore the name of that place is called Ba'al-pera'zim.

12. And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were burned.

13. And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.

14. And when David again inquired of God, God said to him, "You shall not go up after them; go around and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.

15. And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to smite the army of the Philistines."

16. And David did as God commanded him, and they smote the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.

17. And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15

1. David built houses for himself in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.

2. Then David said, "No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to him for ever."

3. And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it.

4. And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:

5. of the sons of Kohath, Uri'el the chief, with a hundred and twenty of his brethren;

6. of the sons of Merar'i, Asai'ah the chief, with two hundred and twenty of his brethren;

7. of the sons of Gershom, Jo'el the chief, with a hundred and thirty of his brethren;

8. of the sons of Eli-za'phan, Shemai'ah the chief, with two hundred of his brethren;

9. of the sons of Hebron, Eli'el the chief, with eighty of his brethren;

10. of the sons of Uz'ziel, Ammin'adab the chief, with a hundred and twelve of his brethren.

11. Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abi'athar, and the Levites Uri'el, Asai'ah, Jo'el, Shemai'ah, Eli'el, and Ammin'adab,

12. and said to them, "You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.

13. Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God broke forth upon us, because we did not care for it in the way that is ordained."

14. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.

15. And the Levites carried the ark of God upon their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.

16. David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.

17. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Jo'el; and of his brethren Asaph the son of Berechi'ah; and of the sons of Merar'i, their brethren, Ethan the son of Kusha'iah;

18. and with them their brethren of the second order, Zechari'ah, Ja-a'ziel, Shemi'ramoth, Jehi'el, Unni, Eli'ab, Benai'ah, Ma-asei'ah, Mattithi'ah, Eliph'elehu, and Miknei'ah, and the gatekeepers O'bed-e'dom and Je-i'el.

19. The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals;

20. Zechari'ah, A'zi-el, Shemi'ramoth, Jehi'el, Unni, Eli'ab, Ma-asei'ah, and Benai'ah were to play harps according to Al'amoth;

21. but Mattithi'ah, Eliph'elehu, Miknei'ah, O'bed-e'dom, Je-i'el, and Azazi'ah were to lead with lyres according to the Shem'inith.

22. Chenani'ah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it.

23. Berechi'ah and Elka'nah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.

24. Shebani'ah, Josh'aphat, Nethan'el, Ama'sai, Zechari'ah, Benai'ah, and Elie'zer, the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. O'bed-e'dom and Jehi'ah also were to be gatekeepers for the ark.

25. So David and the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of O'bed-e'dom with rejoicing.

26. And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.

27. David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenani'ah the leader of the music of the singers; and David wore a linen ephod.

28. So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps and lyres.

29. And as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David dancing and making merry; and she despised him in her heart.

## 1 Chronicles 16

1. And they brought the ark of God, and set it inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.

2. And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD,

3. and distributed to all Israel, both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.

4. Moreover he appointed certain of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the LORD, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.

5. Asaph was the chief, and second to him were Zechari'ah, Je-i'el, Shemi'ramoth, Jehi'el, Mattithi'ah, Eli'ab, Benai'ah, O'bed-e'dom, and Je-i'el, who were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals,

6. and Benai'ah and Jaha'ziel the priests were to blow trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.

7. Then on that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the LORD by Asaph and his brethren.

8. O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the peoples!

9. Sing to him, sing praises to him, tell of all his wonderful works!

10. Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!

11. Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his presence continually!

12. Remember the wonderful works that he has done, the wonders he wrought, the judgments he uttered,

13. O offspring of Abraham his servant, sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!

14. He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

15. He is mindful of his covenant for ever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,

16. the covenant which he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,

17. which he confirmed as a statute to Jacob, as an everlasting covenant to Israel,

18. saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, as your portion for an inheritance."

19. When they were few in number, and of little account, and sojourners in it,

20. wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,

21. he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,

22. saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"

23. Sing to the Lord, all the earth! Tell of his salvation from day to day.

24. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!

25. For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, and he is to be held in awe above all gods.

26. For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but the LORD made the heavens.

27. Honor and majesty are before him; strength and joy are in his place.

28. Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength!

29. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come before him! Worship the LORD in holy array;

30. tremble before him, all the earth; yea, the world stands firm, never to be moved.

31. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns!"

32. Let the sea roar, and all that fills it, let the field exult, and everything in it!

33. Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.

34. O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever!

35. Say also: "Deliver us, O God of our salvation, and gather and save us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

36. Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting!" Then all the people said "Amen!" and praised the LORD.

37. So David left Asaph and his brethren there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister continually before the ark as each day required,

38. and also O'bed-e'dom and his sixty-eight brethren; while O'bed-e'dom, the son of Jedu'thun, and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.

39. And he left Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

40. to offer burnt offerings to the LORD upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of the LORD which he commanded Israel.

41. With them were Heman and Jedu'thun, and the rest of those chosen and expressly named to give thanks to the LORD, for his steadfast love endures for ever.

42. Heman and Jedu'thun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jedu'thun were appointed to the gate.

43. Then all the people departed each to his house, and David went home to bless his household.

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. Now when David dwelt in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent."

2. And Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you."

3. But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan,

4. "Go and tell my servant David, `Thus says the LORD: You shall not build me a house to dwell in.

5. For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I led up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling.

6. In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'

7. Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David, `Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel;

8. and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.

9. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly,

10. from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.

11. When your days are fulfilled to go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.

12. He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne for ever.

13. I will be his father, and he shall be my son; I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,

14. but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for ever.'"

15. In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.

16. Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?

17. And this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast shown me future generations, O LORD God!

18. And what more can David say to thee for honoring thy servant? For thou knowest thy servant.

19. For thy servant's sake, O LORD, and according to thy own heart, thou hast wrought all this greatness, in making known all these great things.

20. There is none like thee, O LORD, and there is no God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

21. What other nation on earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for thyself a name for great and terrible things, in driving out nations before thy people whom thou didst redeem from Egypt?

22. And thou didst make thy people Israel to be thy people for ever; and thou, O LORD, didst become their God.

23. And now, O LORD, let the word which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken;

24. and thy name will be established and magnified for ever, saying, `The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God,' and the house of thy servant David will be established before thee.

25. For thou, my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build a house for him; therefore thy servant has found courage to pray before thee.

26. And now, O LORD, thou art God, and thou hast promised this good thing to thy servant;

27. now therefore may it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for what thou, O LORD, hast blessed is blessed for ever."

## 1 Chronicles 18

1. After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines.

2. And he defeated Moab, and the Mo'abites became servants to David and brought tribute.

3. David also defeated Hadade'zer king of Zobah, toward Hamath, as he went to set up his monument at the river Euphra'tes.

4. And David took from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left enough for a hundred chariots.

5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadade'zer king of Zobah, David slew twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians.

6. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.

7. And David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadade'zer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

8. And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadade'zer, David took very much bronze; with it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.

9. When To'u king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadade'zer, king of Zobah,

10. he sent his son Hador'am to King David, to greet him, and to congratulate him because he had fought against Hadade'zer and defeated him; for Hadade'zer had often been at war with To'u. And he sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver, and of bronze;

11. these also King David dedicated to the LORD, together with the silver and gold which he had carried off from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Am'alek.

12. And Abi'shai, the son of Zeru'iah, slew eighteen thousand E'domites in the Valley of Salt.

13. And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the E'domites became David's servants. And the LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.

14. So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and equity to all his people.

15. And Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah was over the army; and Jehosh'aphat the son of Ahi'lud was recorder;

16. and Zadok the son of Ahi'tub and Ahim'elech the son of Abi'athar were priests; and Shavsha was secretary;

17. and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada was over the Cher'ethites and the Pel'ethites; and David's sons were the chief officials in the service of the king.

## 1 Chronicles 19

1. Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his stead.

2. And David said, "I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt loyally with me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites, to console him.

3. But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, "Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?"

4. So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;

5. and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, "Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return."

6. When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopota'mia, from Aram-ma'acah, and from Zobah.

7. They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Ma'acah with his army, who came and encamped before Med'eba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.

8. When David heard of it, he sent Jo'ab and all the army of the mighty men.

9. And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.

10. When Jo'ab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Syrians;

11. the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abi'shai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.

12. And he said, "If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.

13. Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what seems good to him."

14. So Jo'ab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle; and they fled before him.

15. And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abi'shai, Jo'ab's brother, and entered the city. Then Jo'ab came to Jerusalem.

16. But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphra'tes, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadade'zer at their head.

17. And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and crossed the Jordan, and came to them, and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

18. And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand foot soldiers, and killed also Shophach the commander of their army.

19. And when the servants of Hadade'zer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to help the Ammonites any more.

## 1 Chronicles 20

1. In the spring of the year, the time when kings go forth to battle, Jo'ab led out the army, and ravaged the country of the Ammonites, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Jo'ab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.

2. And David took the crown of their king from his head; he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.

3. And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes; and thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

4. And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sib'becai the Hu'shathite slew Sip'pai, who was one of the descendants of the giants; and the Philistines were subdued.

5. And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elha'nan the son of Ja'ir slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

6. And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was descended from the giants.

7. And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shim'e-a, David's brother, slew him.

8. These were descended from the giants in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.

## 1 Chronicles 21

1. Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel.

2. So David said to Jo'ab and the commanders of the army, "Go, number Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number."

3. But Jo'ab said, "May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should he bring guilt upon Israel?"

4. But the king's word prevailed against Jo'ab. So Jo'ab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came back to Jerusalem.

5. And Jo'ab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and in Judah four hundred and seventy thousand who drew the sword.

6. But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Jo'ab.

7. But God was displeased with this thing, and he smote Israel.

8. And David said to God, "I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, I pray thee, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly."

9. And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,

10. "Go and say to David, `Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'"

11. So Gad came to David and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, `Take which you will:

12. either three years of famine; or three months of devastation by your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence upon the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.' Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me."

13. Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress; let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man."

14. So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell seventy thousand men of Israel.

15. And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but when he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he repented of the evil; and he said to the destroying angel, "It is enough; now stay your hand." And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jeb'usite.

16. And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.

17. And David said to God, "Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father's house; but let not the plague be upon thy people."

18. Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and rear an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jeb'usite.

19. So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD.

20. Now Ornan was threshing wheat; he turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.

21. As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went forth from the threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground.

22. And David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD--give it to me at its full price--that the plague may be averted from the people."

23. Then Ornan said to David, "Take it; and let my lord the king do what seems good to him; see, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for a cereal offering. I give it all."

24. But King David said to Ornan, "No, but I will buy it for the full price; I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings which cost me nothing."

25. So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site.

26. And David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD, and he answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.

27. Then the LORD commanded the angel; and he put his sword back into its sheath.

28. At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jeb'usite, he made his sacrifices there.

29. For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon;

30. but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. Then David said, "Here shall be the house of the LORD God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel."

2. David commanded to gather together the aliens who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God.

3. David also provided great stores of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,

4. and cedar timbers without number; for the Sido'nians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.

5. For David said, "Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and glory throughout all lands; I will therefore make preparation for it." So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.

6. Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.

7. David said to Solomon, "My son, I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.

8. But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, `You have shed much blood and have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood before me upon the earth.

9. Behold, a son shall be born to you; he shall be a man of peace. I will give him peace from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.

10. He shall build a house for my name. He shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel for ever.'

11. Now, my son, the LORD be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.

12. Only, may the LORD grant you discretion and understanding, that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the LORD your God.

13. Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong, and of good courage. Fear not; be not dismayed.

14. With great pains I have provided for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, a million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone too I have provided. To these you must add.

15. You have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen without number, skilled in working

16. gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and be doing! The LORD be with you!"

17. David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,

18. "Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not given you peace on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD and his people.

19. Now set your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God. Arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the LORD."

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. When David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

2. David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites.

3. The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were numbered, and the total was thirty-eight thousand men.

4. "Twenty-four thousand of these," David said, "shall have charge of the work in the house of the LORD, six thousand shall be officers and judges,

5. four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand shall offer praises to the LORD with the instruments which I have made for praise."

6. And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershom, Kohath, and Merar'i.

7. The sons of Gersham were Ladan and Shim'e-i.

8. The sons of Ladan: Jehi'el the chief, and Zetham, and Jo'el, three.

9. The sons of Shim'e-i: Shelo'moth, Ha'zi-el, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' houses of Ladan.

10. And the sons of Shim'e-i: Jahath, Zina, and Je'ush, and Beri'ah. These four were the sons of Shim'e-i.

11. Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Je'ush and Beri'ah had not many sons, therefore they became a father's house in one reckoning.

12. The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uz'ziel, four.

13. The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things, that he and his sons for ever should burn incense before the LORD, and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name for ever.

14. But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi.

15. The sons of Moses: Gershom and Elie'zer.

16. The sons of Gershom: Sheb'uel the chief.

17. The sons of Elie'zer: Rehabi'ah the chief; Elie'zer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabi'ah were very many.

18. The sons of Izhar: Shelo'mith the chief.

19. The sons of Hebron: Jeri'ah the chief, Amari'ah the second, Jaha'ziel the third, and Jekame'am the fourth.

20. The sons of Uz'ziel: Micah the chief and Isshi'ah the second.

21. The sons of Merar'i: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Elea'zar and Kish.

22. Elea'zar died having no sons, but only daughters; their kinsmen, the sons of Kish, married them.

23. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jer'emoth, three.

24. These were the sons of Levi by their fathers' houses, the heads of fathers' houses as they were registered according to the number of the names of the individuals from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the LORD.

25. For David said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has given peace to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem for ever.

26. And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service"--

27. for by the last words of David these were the number of the Levites from twenty years old and upward--

28. "but their duty shall be to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God;

29. to assist also with the showbread, the flour for the cereal offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity or size.

30. And they shall stand every morning, thanking and praising the LORD, and likewise at evening,

31. and whenever burnt offerings are offered to the LORD on sabbaths, new moons, and feast days, according to the number required of them, continually before the LORD.

32. Thus they shall keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and shall attend the sons of Aaron, their brethren, for the service of the house of the LORD."

## 1 Chronicles 24

1. The divisions of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abi'hu, Elea'zar, and Ith'amar.

2. But Nadab and Abi'hu died before their father, and had no children, so Elea'zar and Ith'amar became the priests.

3. With the help of Zadok of the sons of Elea'zar, and Ahim'elech of the sons of Ith'amar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service.

4. Since more chief men were found among the sons of Elea'zar than among the sons of Ith'amar, they organized them under sixteen heads of fathers' houses of the sons of Elea'zar, and eight of the sons of Ith'amar.

5. They organized them by lot, all alike, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both the sons of Elea'zar and the sons of Ith'amar.

6. And the scribe Shemai'ah the son of Nethan'el, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahim'elech the son of Abi'athar, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and of the Levites; one father's house being chosen for Elea'zar and one chosen for Ith'amar.

7. The first lot fell to Jehoi'arib, the second to Jedai'ah,

8. the third to Harim, the fourth to Se-o'rim,

9. the fifth to Malchi'jah, the sixth to Mij'amin,

10. the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abi'jah,

11. the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecani'ah,

12. the eleventh to Eli'ashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

13. the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jesheb'e-ab,

14. the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

15. the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Hap'pizzez,

16. the nineteenth to Pethahi'ah, the twentieth to Jehez'kel,

17. the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,

18. the twenty-third to Delai'ah, the twenty-fourth to Ma-azi'ah.

19. These had as their appointed duty in their service to come into the house of the LORD according to the procedure established for them by Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

20. And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shu'ba-el; of the sons of Shu'ba-el, Jehde'iah.

21. Of Rehabi'ah: of the sons of Rehabi'ah, Isshi'ah the chief.

22. Of the Iz'harites, Shelo'moth; of the sons of Shelo'moth, Jahath.

23. The sons of Hebron: Jeri'ah the chief, Amari'ah the second, Jaha'ziel the third, Jekame'am the fourth.

24. The sons of Uz'ziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.

25. The brother of Micah, Isshi'ah; of the sons of Isshi'ah, Zechari'ah.

26. The sons of Merar'i: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Ja-azi'ah: Beno.

27. The sons of Merar'i: of Ja-azi'ah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.

28. Of Mahli: Elea'zar, who had no sons.

29. Of Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerah'meel.

30. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jer'imoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers' houses.

31. These also, the head of each father's house and his younger brother alike, cast lots, just as their brethren the sons of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahim'elech, and the heads of fathers' houses of the priests and of the Levites.

## 1 Chronicles 25

1. David and the chiefs of the service also set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jedu'thun, who should prophesy with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals. The list of those who did the work and of their duties was:

2. Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethani'ah, and Ashare'lah, sons of Asaph, under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king.

3. Of Jedu'thun, the sons of Jedu'thun: Gedali'ah, Zeri, Jeshai'ah, Shim'e-i, Hashabi'ah, and Mattithi'ah, six, under the direction of their father Jedu'thun, who prophesied with the lyre in thanksgiving and praise to the LORD.

4. Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukki'ah, Mattani'ah, Uz'ziel, Shebu'el, and Jer'imoth, Hanani'ah, Hana'ni, Eli'athah, Giddal'ti, and Romam'ti-e'zer, Joshbekash'ah, Mallo'thi, Hothir, Maha'zi-oth.

5. All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer, according to the promise of God to exalt him; for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

6. They were all under the direction of their father in the music in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jedu'thun, and Heman were under the order of the king.

7. The number of them along with their brethren, who were trained in singing to the LORD, all who were skilful, was two hundred and eighty-eight.

8. And they cast lots for their duties, small and great, teacher and pupil alike.

9. The first lot fell for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedali'ah, to him and his brethren and his sons, twelve;

## 1 Chronicles 26

1. As for the divisions of the gatekeepers: of the Ko'rahites, Meshelemi'ah the son of Ko're, of the sons of Asaph.

2. And Meshelemi'ah had sons: Zechari'ah the first-born, Jedi'a-el the second, Zebadi'ah the third, Jath'ni-el the fourth,

3. Elam the fifth, Jehoha'nan the sixth, Eli-e-ho-e'nai the seventh.

4. And O'bed-e'dom had sons: Shemai'ah the first-born, Jehoz'abad the second, Jo'ah the third, Sachar the fourth, Nethan'el the fifth,

5. Am'mi-el the sixth, Is'sachar the seventh, Pe-ul'lethai the eighth; for God blessed him.

6. Also to his son Shemai'ah were sons born who were rulers in their fathers' houses, for they were men of great ability.

7. The sons of Shemai'ah: Othni, Reph'a-el, Obed, and Elza'bad, whose brethren were able men, Eli'hu and Semachi'ah.

8. All these were of the sons of O'bed-e'dom with their sons and brethren, able men qualified for the service; sixty-two of O'bed-e'dom.

9. And Meshelemi'ah had sons and brethren, able men, eighteen.

10. And Hosah, of the sons of Merar'i, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not the first-born, his father made him chief),

11. Hilki'ah the second, Tebali'ah the third, Zechari'ah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

12. These divisions of the gatekeepers, corresponding to their chief men, had duties, just as their brethren did, ministering in the house of the LORD;

13. and they cast lots by fathers' houses, small and great alike, for their gates.

14. The lot for the east fell to Shelemi'ah. They cast lots also for his son Zechari'ah, a shrewd counselor, and his lot came out for the north.

15. O'bed-e'dom's came out for the south, and to his sons was allotted the storehouse.

16. For Shuppim and Hosah it came out for the west, at the gate of Shal'lecheth on the road that goes up. Watch corresponded to watch.

17. On the east there were six each day, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, as well as two and two at the storehouse;

18. and for the parbar on the west there were four at the road and two at the parbar.

19. These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the Ko'rahites and the sons of Merar'i.

20. And of the Levites, Ahi'jah had charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries of the dedicated gifts.

21. The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers' houses belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehi'eli.

22. The sons of Jehi'eli, Zetham and Jo'el his brother, were in charge of the treasuries of the house of the LORD.

23. Of the Am'ramites, the Iz'harites, the He'bronites, and the Uzzie'lites--

24. and Sheb'uel the son of Gershom, son of Moses, was chief officer in charge of the treasuries.

25. His brethren: from Elie'zer were his son Rehabi'ah, and his son Jeshai'ah, and his son Joram, and his son Zichri, and his son Shelo'moth.

26. This Shelo'moth and his brethren were in charge of all the treasuries of the dedicated gifts which David the king, and the heads of the fathers' houses, and the officers of the thousands and the hundreds, and the commanders of the army, had dedicated.

27. From spoil won in battles they dedicated gifts for the maintenance of the house of the LORD.

28. Also all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah had dedicated--all dedicated gifts were in the care of Shelo'moth and his brethren.

29. Of the Iz'harites, Chenani'ah and his sons were appointed to outside duties for Israel, as officers and judges.

30. Of the He'bronites, Hashabi'ah and his brethren, one thousand seven hundred men of ability, had the oversight of Israel westward of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the service of the king.

31. Of the He'bronites, Jeri'jah was chief of the He'bronites of whatever genealogy or fathers' houses. (In the fortieth year of David's reign search was made and men of great ability among them were found at Jazer in Gilead.)

32. King David appointed him and his brethren, two thousand seven hundred men of ability, heads of fathers' houses, to have the oversight of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manas'sites for everything pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.

## 1 Chronicles 27

1. This is the list of the people of Israel, the heads of fathers' houses, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and their officers who served the king in all matters concerning the divisions that came and went, month after month throughout the year, each division numbering twenty-four thousand:

2. Jasho'beam the son of Zab'di-el was in charge of the first division in the first month; in his division were twenty-four thousand.

22. for Dan, Az'arel the son of Jero'ham. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.

23. David did not number those below twenty years of age, for the LORD had promised to make Israel as many as the stars of heaven.

24. Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah began to number, but did not finish; yet wrath came upon Israel for this, and the number was not entered in the chronicles of King David.

25. Over the king's treasuries was Az'maveth the son of Ad'i-el; and over the treasuries in the country, in the cities, in the villages and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzzi'ah;

33. Ahith'ophel was the king's counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend.

34. Ahith'ophel was succeeded by Jehoi'ada the son of Benai'ah, and Abi'athar. Jo'ab was commander of the king's army.

## 1 Chronicles 28

1. David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the officials of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king, the commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, the stewards of all the property and cattle of the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the mighty men, and all the seasoned warriors.

2. Then King David rose to his feet and said: "Hear me, my brethren and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God; and I made preparations for building.

3. But God said to me, `You may not build a house for my name, for you are a warrior and have shed blood.'

4. Yet the LORD God of Israel chose me from all my father's house to be king over Israel for ever; for he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah my father's house, and among my father's sons he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.

5. And of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

6. He said to me, `It is Solomon your son who shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.

7. I will establish his kingdom for ever if he continues resolute in keeping my commandments and my ordinances, as he is today.'

8. Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever.

9. "And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.

10. Take heed now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it."

11. Then David gave Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;

12. and the plan of all that he had in mind for the courts of the house of the LORD, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for dedicated gifts;

13. for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work of the service in the house of the LORD; for all the vessels for the service in the house of the LORD,

14. the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight of silver vessels for each service,

15. the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand in the service,

16. the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, the silver for the silver tables,

17. and pure gold for the forks, the basins, and the cups; for the golden bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each;

18. for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

19. All this he made clear by the writing from the hand of the LORD concerning it, all the work to be done according to the plan.

20. Then David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and of good courage, and do it. Fear not, be not dismayed; for the LORD God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.

21. And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command."

## 1 Chronicles 29

1. And David the king said to all the assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great; for the palace will not be for man but for the LORD God.

2. So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones, and marble.

3. Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God:

4. three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house,

5. and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the LORD?"

6. Then the heads of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king's work.

7. They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.

8. And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in the care of Jehi'el the Gershonite.

9. Then the people rejoiced because these had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the LORD; David the king also rejoiced greatly.

10. Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly; and David said: "Blessed art thou, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.

11. Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

12. Both riches and honor come from thee, and thou rulest over all. In thy hand are power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.

13. And now we thank thee, our God, and praise thy glorious name.

14. "But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from thee, and of thy own have we given thee.

15. For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.

16. O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building thee a house for thy holy name comes from thy hand and is all thy own.

17. I know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness; in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen thy people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to thee.

18. O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep for ever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of thy people, and direct their hearts toward thee.

19. Grant to Solomon my son that with a whole heart he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, performing all, and that he may build the palace for which I have made provision."

20. Then David said to all the assembly, "Bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and did obeisance to the king.

21. And they performed sacrifices to the LORD, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the LORD, a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel;

22. and they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness.  And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him as prince for the LORD, and Zadok as priest.

23. Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father; and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.

24. All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.

25. And the LORD gave Solomon great repute in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

26. Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

27. The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

28. Then he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

29. Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of Gad the seer,

30. with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that came upon him and upon Israel, and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
