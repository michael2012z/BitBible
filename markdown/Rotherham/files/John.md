## John 1

1. Originally, was, the Word, and, the Word, was, with God; and, the Word, was, God.

2. The same, was originally, with God.

3. All things, through him, came into existence, and, without him, came into existence, not even one thing: that which hath come into existence,

4. in him, was, life, and, the life, was, the light of men.— 

5.  And, the light, in the darkness, shineth; and, the darkness, thereof, laid not hold.

6. There arose a man, sent from God, whose name was, John:

7. The same, came, for a witness, That he might bear witness, concerning the light, that, all, might believe, through him.

8. He, was not the light,—but, that he might bear witness concerning the light,

9. It, was—The real light that enlighteneth every man—Coming into the world.

10. In the world, he was, and, the world, through him, came into existence, and, the world, knew him not.

11. Into his own possessions, he came, and, his own people, received him not home.

12. But, as many as did receive him, he gave, unto them, authority, children of God, to become,—unto them who were believing on his name:

13. Who—not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but—of God, were born.

14. And, the Word, became, flesh, and pitched his tent among us, and we gazed upon his glory,—a glory, as an Only-begotten from his Father. Full of favour and truth. 

15.  (John beareth witness concerning him, and hath cried aloud, saying—the same, was he that said—He who, after me, was coming, before me, hath advanced; because, my Chief, was he.)

16. Because, out of his fulness, we all, received, even favour over against favour.

17. Because, the law, through Moses, was given, favour and truth, through Jesus Christ, came into existence.

18. No one, hath seen, God, at any time: An Only Begotten God, The One existing within the bosom of the Father, He, hath interpreted [him] . 

19.  And, this, is the witness of John, when the Jews sent forth unto him, out of Jerusalem, priests and Levites,—that they might question him—Who art, thou?

20. and he confessed, and did not deny,—and he confessed—I, am not, the Christ;

21. and they questioned him—What then? Art, thou, Elijah? and he saith—I am not; The prophet, art, thou? and he answered—No!

22. So they said unto him—Who, art thou? that, an answer, we may give, unto them who sent us,—What sayest thou, concerning thyself?

23. He said—I, am a Voice, of one crying aloud;—In the desert, make ye straight, the way of the Lord: according as said Isaiah the prophet.

24. And they had been sent forth from among the Pharisees;

25. and they questioned him, and said unto him—Why, then, dost thou immerse,—if, thou, art not, the Christ, nor Elijah, nor, the Prophet?

26. John answered them, saying—I, immerse, in water. In the midst of you, standeth one, whom, ye, know not;—

27. after me, coming:—Of whom, I, am not worthy that I should unloose the thong of the sandal.

28. These things, in Bethany, came to pass, beyond the Jordan, where John was, immersing. 

29.  On the morrow, he beholdeth Jesus, coming unto him, and saith—See! the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.

30. This, is he, of whom, I, said—After me, cometh a man, who, before me, hath advanced, because, my Chief, was he.

31. And, I, knew him not, but, that he might be manifested unto Israel, therefore, came, I, in water, immersing.

32. And John bare witness, saying—I have gazed upon the Spirit, descending like a dove, out of heaven,—and it abode upon him.

33. And, I, knew him not,—but, he that sent me to immerse in water, he, unto me, said—Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon him, the same, is he that immerseth in Holy Spirit.

34. I, therefore, have seen, and borne witness—That, this, is, the, Son of God.

35. On the morrow, again, was John standing, and, from among his disciples, two;

36. and, looking at Jesus walking, he saith—See! the Lamb of God! 

37.  and the two disciples hearkened unto him speaking, and they followed Jesus.

38. But Jesus, turning, and looking at them following, saith unto them—What seek ye? And, they, said unto him—Rabbi! which meaneth, when translated, Teacher, Where abidest thou?

39. He saith unto them—Be coming, and ye shall see. They came, therefore, and saw where he abode, and, with him, they abode that day. It was about the tenth, hour.

40. One of the two that heard from John and followed him, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.

41. The same findeth, first, his own brother Simon, and saith unto him—We have found the Messiah! which is, when translated, Anointed.

42. He led him unto Jesus. Jesus, looking at him, said—Thou, art Simon, the son of John,—thou, shalt be called, Cephas; which is to be translated, Peter. 

43.  On the morrow, he desired to go forth into Galilee. And Jesus findeth Philip, and saith unto him—Be following me!

44. Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip, findeth, Nathanael, and saith unto him—Him, of whom wrote Moses in the law, and the Prophets, have we found.—Jesus, son of Joseph, him from Nazareth!

46. And Nathanael said unto him—Out of Nazareth, can any good thing come? Philip saith unto him—Come, and see!

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him, and saith concerning him—See! Truly, an Israelite, in whom is no guile.

48. Nathanael saith unto him—Whence, dost thou, know, me? Jesus answered, and said unto him—Before Philip called thee,—when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.

49. Nathanael answered him—Rabbi! thou, art, the Son of God: Thou, art, King, of Israel.

50. Jesus answered, and said unto him—Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? A greater thing than these, shalt thou see!

51. And he saith unto him—Verily, verily, I say unto you: Ye shall see heaven—when set open, and, the messengers of God, ascending and descending unto the Son of Man.  

## John 2

1. And, on the third day, a marriage, took place, in Cana, of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there,—

2. and Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, unto the marriage.

3. And, wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith unto him—Wine, have they none!

4. And Jesus saith unto her—What part can I take with thee, O woman? Not yet, hath come, mine hour.

5. His mother saith unto them who are ministering—Whatsoever he may say to you, do!

6. Now there were there, six stone water-vessels, placed, according to the purification of the Jews; holding each, two or three measures.

7. Jesus saith unto them—Fill the vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

8. And he saith unto them—Draw out now, and be bearing unto the master of the feast. And they bare.

9. And, when the master of the feast had tasted the water, now made, wine, and knew not whence it was,—though, they who were ministering, knew, even they who had drawn out the water, the master accosteth the bridegroom,

10. and saith unto him—Every man, first the good wine, setteth out; and, when they had been well-supplied, the inferior:—Thou, hast kept the good wine until, even now.

11. This, beginning of his signs, did Jesus, in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 

12.  After this, he came down into Capernaum,—he, and his mother and brethren, and his disciples; and, there, they abode, not many days.

13. And, near, was the passover of the Jews; and, Jesus, went up unto Jerusalem.

14. And he found, in the temple, them that were selling oxen and sheep and doves, also the money-changers sitting.

15. And, making a scourge out of rushes, all of them, thrust he forth out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and, the money-changers’ small coins, poured he forth, and, the tables, he overturned;

16. and unto them who were selling, the doves, he said—Take these things hence! Be not making, the house of my Father, a house of merchandise.

17. His disciples remembered that it was written—The zeal of thy house, eateth me up.

18. The Jews therefore answered, and said unto him, What sign, dost thou point out to us, in that, these things, thou doest?

19. Jesus answered, and said unto them—Take down this shrine, and, in three days, will I raise it.

20. The Jews, therefore, said—In forty and six years, was this shrine built. And, thou, in three days, wilt raise it!

21. But, he, was speaking concerning the shrine of his body.

22. When, therefore, he had been raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered, that, this, he had been saying; and they believed in the Scripture, and in the word which Jesus had spoken. 

23.  Now, when he was in Jerusalem, during the passover, during the feast, many, believed on his name, viewing his signs which he was doing.

24. Jesus himself, however, was not trusting himself unto them, by reason of his understanding them all,

25. and because he had, no need, that anyone should bear witness concerning man; for, he, understood what was in man.  

## John 3

1. There was however, a man from among the Pharisees, Nicodemus, his name,—ruler of the Jews.

2. The same, came unto him, by night, and said unto him—Rabbi! we know that, from God, thou hast come, a teacher; for, no one, can be doing, these signs, which, thou, art doing, except, God, be with him.

3. Jesus answered, and said unto him—Verily, verily, I say unto thee: Except one be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

4. Nicodemus saith unto him—How, can a man be born, when he is, old? Can he, into the womb of his mother, a second time, enter, and be born?

5. Jesus answered—Verily, verily, I say unto thee: Except one be born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

6. That which hath been born of the flesh, is, flesh, and, that which hath been born of the spirit, is, spirit.

7. Do not marvel, that I said unto thee: Ye must needs be born from above.

8. The spirit, where it pleaseth, doth breathe, and, the sound thereof, thou hearest; but knowest not, whence it cometh and whither it goeth: Thus, is every one who hath been born of the spirit.

9. Nicodemus answered, and said unto him—How, can these things, come about?

10. Jesus answered, and said unto him—Art, thou, the teacher of Israel, and, these things, knowest not?

11. Verily, verily, I say unto thee: What we know, we speak, and, of what we have seen, we bear witness, and, our witness, ye receive not.

12. If, the earthly things, I told you, and ye believe not, How, if I should tell you the heavenly things, will ye believe?

13. And, no one, hath ascended into heaven, save he that, out of heaven, descended,—The Son of Man.

14. And, just as, Moses, lifted up the serpent in the desert, so, must, the Son of Man, be lifted up,—

15. That, whosoever believeth in him, may have life age-abiding.

16. For God, so loved, the world, that, his Only Begotten Son, he gave,—that, whosoever believeth on him, might not perish, but have life age-abiding.

17. For God, sent not, his Son into the world, that he might judge the world, but, that the world might be saved through him.

18. He that believeth on him, is not to be judged: he that believeth not, already, hath been judged,—because he hath not believed on the name of the Only Begotten Son of God.

19. And, this, is the judgment: That, the light, hath come into the world,—and men loved, rather the darkness than the light, for, wicked, were their, works.

20. For, whosoever doth practise corrupt things, hateth the light, and cometh not unto the light, lest his works should be reproved;

21. But, he that doeth the truth, cometh unto the light, that his works may be, made manifest, that, in God, have they been wrought. 

22.  After these things, came Jesus, and his disciples, into the Judaean land; and, there, was he tarrying with them, and immersing.

23. And John also was immersing in Aenon, near to him, because, many waters, were there; and they were coming, and being immersed;—

24. for, not yet, had John been cast into prison.

25. There arose, therefore, a questioning, from among the disciples of John, with a Jew,—concerning purification.

26. And they came unto John, and said unto him—Rabbi! he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, unto whom, thou, hast borne witness, see! the same, is immersing; and, all, are coming unto him.

27. John answered, and said—A man can receive, nothing, except it have been given him out of heaven.

28. Ye yourselves, unto me, bear witness, that, I, said—I, am not the Christ; but—I am sent before, That One.

29. He that hath the bride, is, bridegroom; but, the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth by and hearkeneth unto him, greatly, rejoiceth, by reason of the voice of the bridegroom. This, my joy, therefore, is fulfilled.

30. That One, it behoveth to increase,—but, me, to decrease.

31. He that, from above, doth come, over all, is: he that is of the earth, of the earth, is, and, of the earth, doth speak: he that, out of heaven, doth come, over all, is,

32. What he hath seen and heard, of, the same, he beareth witness,—and, his witness, no one, receiveth:—

33. He that hath received his witness, hath set seal—that, God, is, true.

34. For, he whom God hath sent, the sayings of God, doth speak; for, not by measure, giveth he the Spirit.

35. The Father, loveth the Son, and, all things, hath given into his hand.

36. He that believeth on the Son, hath life age-abiding: whereas, he that yieldeth not unto the Son, shall not see life,—but, the anger of God, awaiteth him.  

## John 4

1. When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pharisees had heard—Jesus, more disciples, is making and immersing, than John,—

2. although indeed, Jesus himself, was not immersing, but his disciples,

3. he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. 

4.  Now he must needs pass through Samaria.

5. He cometh, therefore, unto a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground which Jacob gave unto Joseph his son.

6. Now Jacob’s fountain was there. Jesus, therefore, having become toil-worn with the journey, was sitting thus, upon the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.

7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto her—Give me to drink!

8. for, his disciples, had gone away into the city, that, food, they might buy.

9. The Samaritan woman, therefore, saith unto him—How dost, thou, being, a Jew, ask to drink, of me, who am, a Samaritan woman? [for, Jews, have no dealings with Samaritans.]

10. Jesus answered, and said unto her—If thou hadst known the free gift of God, and who it is that is saying unto thee, Give me to drink, thou, wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.

11. She saith unto him—Sir! not even a bucket, hast thou,—and, the well, is, deep:—Whence, then, hast thou the living water?

12. Art, thou, greater than, our father Jacob, who gave us the well,—and, himself, out of it drank, and his sons, and his flocks?

13. Jesus answered, and said unto her—Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst, again;

14. But, whosoever shall drink of the water which, I, will give him, in nowise shall thirst, unto times age-abiding,—but, the water which I will give him, shall become, within him, a fountain of water, springing up unto life age-abiding.

15. The woman saith unto him—Sir! give me this water, that I thirst not, neither be coming hither to draw.

16. He saith unto her—Go, call thy husband, and come hither!

17. The woman answered, and said [unto him]—I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her—Well, saidst thou, A husband, I have not;

18. for, five husbands, thou hast had,—and, now, he whom thou hast, is not thy, husband: This true thing, hast thou spoken.

19. The woman saith unto him—Sir! I perceive that, a prophet, art, thou:—

20. Our fathers, in this mountain, worshipped; and, ye, say, that, in Jerusalem, is the place, where, to worship, it behoveth.

21. Jesus saith unto her—Believe me, woman! There cometh an hour, when, neither in this mountain, nor yet in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.

22. Ye, worship, that which ye know not; We, worship, that which we know; because, salvation, is, of the Jews.

23. But there cometh an hour, and, now, is,—when, the real worshippers, shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for, even the Father, is seeking, such as these, as his worshippers.

24. God is, spirit; and, they that worship him, in spirit and truth, must needs worship.

25. The woman saith unto him—I know that, Messiah, cometh, who is called Christ,—Whensoever, he, shall come, he will tell us, everything.

26. Jesus saith unto her—I, that speak unto thee, am he. 

27.  And, hereupon, came his disciples, and they began to marvel, that, with a woman, he was talking. No one, however, said—What seekest thou? or—Why talkest thou with her?

28. The woman, therefore, left her water-vessel, and went away into the city, and saith unto the men—

29. Come! see a man, that told me all things that ever I did: Can, this, be, the Christ?

30. They came forth out of the city, and were coming unto him.

31. In the meantime, the disciples were requesting him, saying—Rabbi! eat.

32. But, he, said unto them—I, have, food, to eat, of which, ye, know not.

33. The disciples, therefore, began to say, one to another—Hath anyone brought him, to eat?

34. Jesus saith unto them—My food, is, that I should do the will of him that sent me, and complete, his work.

35. Are, ye, not saying—Yet, a fourmonth, it is, and, the harvest, cometh? Lo! I say unto you—Lift up your eyes, and gaze at the fields,—that, white, are they unto, harvest. Already,

36. he that reapeth, receiveth, a reward, and gathereth fruit unto life age-abiding; that, he that soweth, together may rejoice, with him that reapeth.

37. For, herein, doth the saying, hold good,—One, is the sower, and, another, is the reaper.

38. I, sent you forth, to be reaping that whereon, ye, have not toiled: Others, have toiled, and, ye, into their toil, have entered.

39. And, out of that city, many, believed on him—of the Samaritans,—by reason of the word of the woman in bearing witness—He told me all things that ever I did.

40. When, therefore, the Samaritans came unto him, they went on to request him to abide with them; and he abode there two days.

41. And, many more, believed by reason of his discourse;

42. and, unto the woman, began to say—No longer, by reason of thy talk, do we believe; for, we ourselves, have heard, and know that, This One, is, in truth, the Saviour of the world. 

43.  But, after the two days, he went forth from thence, into Galilee.

44. For, Jesus himself, bare witness, that, a prophet, in his own fatherland, hath not, honour.

45. So, when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed him, having seen, all things, whatsoever he had done in Jerusalem during the feast; for, they also, went unto the feast.

46. So he came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water, wine. And there was a certain courtier, whose son was sick, in Capernaum.

47. The same, hearing that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, came away unto him, and began requesting him, that he would come down and heal his son; for he was on the point of dying.

48. Jesus therefore said unto him—Except, signs and wonders, ye see, in nowise will ye believe.

49. The courtier saith unto him—Sir! come down, ere my child die!

50. Jesus saith unto him—Be going thy way: thy son, liveth! And the man believed in the word which Jesus spake to him, and at once went his way.

51. And, when he was even now going down, his servants, met him, saying, that, his boy, was living.

52. So he enquired the hour, from them, when he began, to amend. They said, therefore, unto him—Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.

53. So the father took note that it was, in that hour, wherein Jesus said unto him—Thy son, liveth! and he believed, he, and all his house.

54. Now, this again, as, a second sign, Jesus did, after coming out of Judaea into Galilee.  

## John 5

1. After these things, was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up unto Jerusalem.

2. Now there is in Jerusalem, at the Sheep-gate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethzatha,—having, five porches.

3. In these, was lying a throng of them who were sick,—blind, lame, withered.

4. And there was a certain man there, who, for thirty-eight years, had continued in his sickness.

5. Jesus, seeing, this one, lying, and taking note that now, a long time, had he continued, saith unto him—Desirest thou to be made, well?

6. The sick man answered him—Sir! I have, no man, that, as soon as the water hath been troubled, might thrust me into the pool; but, while, I, am coming, another, before me, goeth down.

7. Jesus saith unto him—Rise! take up thy couch, and be walking.

8. And, straightway, the man was made well and took up his couch, and began to walk. Now it was Sabbath, on that day.

9. The Jews, therefore, were saying, unto him who had been cured—It is, Sabbath; and it is not allowable for thee to take up thy couch:—

10. who, however, answered them—He that made me well, he, unto me, said—Take up thy couch, and be walking.

11. They questioned him—Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up [thy couch], and be walking?

12. But, the healed one, knew not, who, it was; for, Jesus, had turned aside, a multitude, being in the place.

13. After these things, Jesus findeth him, in the temple, and said unto him—See! thou hast become, well:—No more, be committing sin, lest, some worse thing, do thee befall.

14. The man went away, and told the Jews, that it was, Jesus, who had made him well.

15. And, on this account, were the Jews persecuting Jesus, because, these things, he had been doing, on Sabbath. 

16.  But, he, answered them—My Father, until even now, is working; and, I, am working.

17. On this account, therefore, the rather, were the Jews seeking to slay him,—because, not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but was calling God, his own Father, making, himself, equal, with, God.

18. Jesus, therefore, answered, and went on to say unto them—Verily, verily, I say unto you: The Son cannot be doing, of himself, a single thing,—save anything he may see, the Father, doing; for, whatsoever, he, may be doing, these things, the Son also, in like manner, doeth.

19. For, the Father, dearly loveth the Son, and, all things, pointeth out to him, which, himself, is doing; and, greater works than these, will he point out to him, that, ye, may marvel.

20. For, just as the Father waketh up the dead, and quickeneth them, in like manner, the Son also, whom he pleaseth, doth quicken.

21. For neither doth, the Father, judge anyone,—but, all the judging, hath given unto the Son:

22. That, all, may honour the Son, just as they honour the Father: he that doth not honour the Son, doth not, in fact, honour the Father who sent him.

23. Verily, verily, I say unto you: He that heareth, my word, and believeth in him that sent me, hath life age-abiding, and, into judgment, cometh not, but hath passed over, out of death into life.

24. Verily, verily, I say unto you: There cometh an hour, and now is, when, the dead, shall hearken unto the voice of the Son of God, and, they who have hearkened, shall live.

25. For, just as, the Father, hath life, in himself, in like manner, unto the Son also, hath he given, life, to have, in himself;

26. And, authority, hath he given him, to be executing, judgment,—because, Son of Man, is he!

27. Do not be marvelling at this: because there come an hour, in which, all they in the tombs, shall hearken unto his voice,

28. and shall come forth,—they who, the good things, have done, unto a resurrection, of life; but, they who the corrupt things, have practised, unto a resurrection, of judgment.

29. I, cannot be doing, of myself, a single thing,—Just as I hear, I judge; and, my judging, is, just,—because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me. 

30.  If, I, bear witness, concerning myself, my witness, is not, true.

31. Another, it is, who beareth witness concerning me,—and I know that, true, is the witness which he witnesseth concerning me.

32. Ye, have sent forth unto John,—and he hath borne witness to the truth:—

33. I, however, not from man, my witness, receive; but, these things, I say, that, ye, may be saved:—

34. He, was the burning and shining lamp, and, ye, were willing to exult, for an hour, in his light.

35. But, I, have, as my witness, something greater than John’s; for, the works which the Father hath given me, that I should complete them,—the works themselves which I am doing, bear witness concerning me, that, the Father, hath sent me.

36. And so, the Father who sent me, he, hath borne witness concerning me; Neither, a sound of him, at any time, have ye heard, nor, a form of him, have ye seen;

37. And, his word, ye have not, within you abiding—because, as touching him whom, he, sent, in him, ye, believe not.

38. Ye search the Scriptures, because, ye, think, by them, to have, life age-abiding; and, those [Scriptures], are they which bear witness concerning me:

39. And yet ye choose not to come unto me, that, life, ye may have.

40. Glory from men, am I not receiving;—

41. But I have taken knowledge of you, that, the love of God, ye have not, in yourselves:—

42. I, have come, in the name of my Father,—and ye are not receiving me: If, another, shall come in his own name, him, ye will receive!

43. How can, ye, believe,—Glory from one another, receiving; and, the glory which is from the only God, are not seeking?

44. Do not think that, I, will accuse you unto the Father: There, is, who accuseth you, even, Moses,—on whom, ye, have set your hope.

45. For, if ye had been believing, in Moses, ye would, in that case, have been believing, in me: for, concerning me, he wrote.

46. But, if, in his writings, ye are not believing, how, in my sayings, will ye believe?  

## John 6

1. After these things, Jesus went away across the sea of Galilee, that is, of Tiberias;

2. and there was following him a great multitude, because they had been viewing the signs which he did upon such as were sick.

3. But Jesus had gone up into the mountain, and, there, was sitting with his disciples.

4. Now the passover was near, the feast of the Jews.

5. So then Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and beholding that a great multitude was coming unto him, saith unto Philip—Whence are we to buy loaves, that these may eat?

6. But, this, he was saying, to test him; for, he himself, knew, what he was about to do.

7. Philip answered him—Two hundred denaries-worth of loaves, are not sufficient for them, that, each one, may take, a little.

8. One from among his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, saith unto him—

9. There is a little lad here, that hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes,—but, these,—what are they, for such numbers?

10. Jesus said—Make the people recline. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, to the number of about five thousand.

11. Jesus therefore took the loaves, and, giving thanks, went on distributing unto them that reclined; in like manner, of the small fishes also: as much as they were wishing.

12. And, when they were well-filled, he saith unto his disciples—Gather up the broken pieces left over, that nothing be lost.

13. So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets, with broken pieces out of the five barley loaves,—which were left over by them who had eaten.

14. The people, therefore, seeing what signs he wrought, began to say—This, is, of a truth, the prophet who was to come into the world. 

15.  Jesus, therefore, getting to know that they were about to come, and seize him, that they might make him king, retired again into the mountain, himself, alone.

16. But, when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea;

17. and, entering into a boat, were going across the sea into Capernaum. And, dark, already, had it become, and, not yet, had Jesus reached them;

18. moreover the sea, by reason of a great wind that blew, was rising high.

19. Having therefore rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they observe Jesus, walking upon the sea, and, near the boat, coming; and they were affrighted.

20. But, he, saith unto them—It is, I: be not affrighted!

21. They were willing, therefore, to receive him into the boat; and, straightway, the boat was at land, whither they had been slowly going. 

22.  On the morrow, the multitude that was standing on the other side of the sea, saw that there was not, another small-boat, there, save one,—and that Jesus entered not, along with his disciples, unto the boat, but that, alone, his disciples departed:—

23. howbeit there came boats out of Tiberias, near the place where they did eat the bread, after the Lord had given thanks:—

24. When, therefore, the multitude saw, that, Jesus, was not there, nor yet his disciples, they themselves, got into the small boats, and came unto Capernaum, seeking Jesus;

25. and, finding him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him—Rabbi! when, camest thou, hither?

26. Jesus answered them, and said—Verily, verily, I say unto you: Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.

27. Be working, not for the food that perisheth, but for the food that endureth unto life age-abiding,—which, the Son of Man, unto you, will give; for upon, the same, hath the Father, even God, set his seal. 

28.  They said, therefore, unto him—What are we to do, that we may be working the works of God?

29. Jesus answered, and said unto them—This, is the work of God: that ye believe on him whom, he, hath sent forth.

30. They said, therefore, unto him—What, then, art, thou, doing, by way of sign, that we may see, and believe in thee: what art thou working?

31. Our fathers, did eat, the manna, in the desert,—just as it is written: Bread out of heaven, he gave them to eat.

32. Jesus said unto them—Verily, verily, I say unto you: Not Moses, gave you the bread out of heaven; but, my Father, giveth you the real bread out of heaven.

33. For, the bread of God, is that which is coming down out of heaven, and giving, life, unto the world.

34. They said, therefore, unto him—Sir! Evermore, give us this bread.

35. Jesus said unto them—I, am the bread of life: he that cometh unto me, in nowise shall hunger, and, he that believeth on me, in nowise shall thirst, any more.

36. But I told you—Ye have even seen [me], and yet do not believe.

37. All that which the Father is giving me, unto me, will have come, and, him that cometh unto me, in nowise will I cast out,—

38. Because I have come down from heaven,—Not that I should be doing my own will, but the will of him that sent me.

39. And, this, is the will of him that sent me, That, of all that which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.

40. For, this, is the will of my Father, That, every one that vieweth the Son, and believeth on him, should have life age-abiding, and, I, should raise him up, at the last day.

41. The Jews, therefore, began to murmur concerning him, because he said—I, am the bread that came down out of heaven;

42. and were saying—Is not, this, Jesus, the son of Joseph,—of whom, we, know the father and the mother! How is it then, that he, now, saith: Out of heaven, have I come down?

43. Jesus answered, and said unto them—Be not murmuring, one with another:

44. No one, can come unto me, except, the Father who sent me, draw him,—and, I, will raise him up, in the last day.

45. It is written in the prophets,—And they shall be, all, the instructed of God: Every one who hath heard of the Father, and learned, cometh unto me.

46. Not that any one hath seen, the Father, save he who is from God,—this one, hath seen the Father.

47. Verily, verily, I say unto you: He that believeth, hath life age-abiding.

48. I am the bread of life:—

49. Your fathers, did eat, in the desert, the manna,—and died:

50. This, is the bread which, out of heaven, cometh down, that one, thereof, may eat,—and not die.

51. I, am the living bread, which, out of heaven, came down: If one eat of this bread, he shall live unto times age-abiding; and, the bread, moreover, which, I, will give, is, my flesh—for the world’s life.

52. The Jews, therefore, began to strive one with another, saying—How can this one, unto us, give his flesh to eat?

53. Jesus, therefore, said unto them—Verily, verily, I say unto you—Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have not life within yourselves.

54. He that feedeth upon my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath life age-abiding, and, I, will raise him up at the last day;

55. For, my flesh, is, true, food, and, my blood, is, true, drink:

56. He that feedeth upon my flesh, and drinketh my blood, in me, abideth, and, I, in him.

57. Just as the living Father sent me,—and I live by reason of the Father, he also that feedeth upon me, even he, shall live by reason of me.

58. This, is the bread, which, out of heaven, came down:—Not just as your fathers did eat—and died! He that feedeth upon this bread, shall live unto times age-abiding.

59. These things, said he, as, in a synagogue, he was teaching, in Capernaum. 

60.  Many, of his disciples, therefore, when they heard, said—Hard, is this discourse,—Who can, thereunto, hearken?

61. But Jesus, knowing within himself that his disciples were murmuring concerning this, said unto them—Doth, this, cause, you, to stumble?

62. [What] then, if ye should view the Son of Man ascending where he was before? …

63. The spirit, it is, that giveth life,—the flesh, profiteth, nothing: The declarations which, I, have spoken unto you, are, spirit, and, are, life.

64. But there are some from among you, who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who it was would deliver him up;—

65. and he went on to say—For this cause, have I said unto you: No one, can come unto me, except it have been given him, of the Father.

66. Because of this, many from among his disciples, went away back, and, no longer, with him, were walking.

67. Jesus, therefore, said unto the twelve—Are, ye also, wishing to withdraw?

68. Simon Peter answered him—Lord! unto whom, shall we go? Declarations of life age-abiding, thou hast;

69. And, we, have believed, and come to know,—that, thou, art the Holy One of God.

70. Jesus answered them—Did not, I, make choice, of you, the twelve? And yet, from among you, one, is, an adversary.

71. Now he was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot: for, the same, was about to deliver him up,—one of the twelve.  

## John 7

1. And, after these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee; for he was not wishing, in Judaea, to be walking, because the Jews were seeking to slay him.

2. But the feast of the Jews was near, that of the pitching of tents.

3. His brethren, therefore, said unto him—Remove hence, and withdraw into Judaea, that, thy disciples also, may view thy works which thou art doing.

4. For, no one, anything in secret, doeth, and yet is seeking, himself, to be well-known. If, these things, thou art doing, manifest thyself unto the world.

5. For, not even his brethren, were believing on him.

6. Jesus, therefore, saith unto them—My season, not yet, is here; but, your season, at anytime, is ready:

7. The world cannot hate you; but, me, it hateth, because, I, bear witness concerning it, that, the works thereof, are, wicked.

8. Ye, go up unto the feast: I, not yet, am coming up unto this feast, because, my season, not yet, hath fully come.

9. And, these things, having said unto them, he was still abiding in Galilee.

10. But, when his brethren had gone up unto the feast, then, he also, went up,—not openly, but as it were in secret.

11. The Jews, therefore, were seeking him in the feast, and were saying—Where is that one?

12. and there was great, murmuring, about him among the multitudes: some, indeed, were saying—Good, is he! [but], others, were saying—Not so! but he is leading the multitude astray.

13. No one, nevertheless, was speaking, openly, about him, because of their fear of the Jews. 

14.  Presently, however, the feast being at its height, Jesus went up unto the temple and was teaching.

15. The Jews, therefore, began to marvel, saying—How, doth this one know, letters, not having learned?

16. Jesus, therefore, answered them, and said—My teaching, is not mine, but his who sent me.

17. If any one intend, his will, to do, he shall get to know concerning the teaching—whether it is, of God, or, I, from myself, am speaking,

18. He that, from himself, doth speak, his own glory, is seeking: he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same, is, true, and, injustice, in him, is there none.

19. Did not, Moses, give you the law? And yet, not one of you, doeth the law!—Why, seek ye, to slay, me?

20. The multitude answered—A demon, thou hast: Who, is seeking, to slay, thee?

21. Jesus answered, and said unto them—One work, I did, and ye, all, are marvelling:

22. For this cause, Moses, hath given you, circumcision,—not that, of Moses, it is, but of the fathers;—and, on Sabbath, ye circumcise a man.

23. If, circumcision, a man receiveth, on Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, with me, are ye bitter as gall, because, a whole man, I made, well, on Sabbath?

24. Be not judging according to appearance, but, just judgment, be judging,

25. So then, some of them of Jerusalem were saying—Is not, this, he whom they are seeking to kill?

26. And yet, see! with freedom of speech, he is talking, and, nothing, unto him, do they say:—Have the rulers perhaps come to know, of a truth, that, this, is, the Christ?

27. But, as for this one, we know whence he is; The Christ, however, whensoever he shall come, no one, getteth to know whence he is.

28. Jesus, therefore, cried aloud in the temple, teaching, and saying—Both me, ye know, and ye know whence I am,—and yet, of myself, have I not come, but he is real, who sent me, whom, ye, know not.

29. I, know him, because, from him, I am, and, he, sent me forth.

30. They were seeking therefore to seize him; and yet no one laid on him his hand, because, not yet, had come his hour.

31. But, from amongst the multitude, many, believed on him, and were saying—The Christ, whensoever he cometh, greater signs, will he do, than those which, this one, did?

32. The Pharisees hearkened unto the multitude murmuring concerning him these things; and the High-priests and the Pharisees sent forth officers, that they might seize him.

33. Jesus, therefore, said—Yet a little time, I am, with you, and withdraw unto him that sent me:

34. Ye shall seek me, and not find me, and, where, I, am, ye, cannot come.

35. The Jews, therefore, said unto themselves—Whither, is, this one, about to go, that we shall not find him? Unto the dispersion of the Greeks, is he about to go, and teach the Greeks?

36. What, is this which he said: Ye shall seek me and not find me, and, where, I, am, ye, cannot come? 

37.  Now, on the last—the great—day of the feast, Jesus was standing, and he cried aloud, saying—If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink:

38. He that believeth on me—just as said the Scripture,—River, from within him, shall flow, of living water.

39. Now, this, spake he concerning the Spirit which they who believed on him were about to receive; for, not yet, was there Spirit, because, Jesus, not yet, was glorified!

40. Some from amongst the multitude, therefore, having hearkened unto these words, were saying—This, is, in truth, the prophet.

41. Others, were saying—This, is, the Christ. But, others, were saying—Out of Galilee, is, the Christ, to come?

42. Hath not the Scripture said: Of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was, cometh the Christ?

43. A division, therefore, arose in the multitude, because of him.

44. Certain, indeed, from among them, were wishing to seize him; but, no one, thrust upon him his hands. 

45.  So then the officers came unto the High-priests and Pharisees, and, they, said unto them—For what cause, have ye not brought him?

46. The officers answered—Never, man spake thus!

47. The Pharisees, therefore, answered them—Surely, ye also, have not been led astray?

48. Surely, none of the rulers, hath believed in him, nor of the Pharisees?

49. But, this multitude, that take no note of the law, are, laid under a curse.

50. Nicodemus saith unto them—he that came unto him formerly, being, one, from among them—

51. Surely, our law, doth not judge the man, unless it hear first from him, and get to know what he is doing?

52. They answered and said unto him—Surely, thou also, art not, of Galilee? Search and see! That, out of Galilee, a prophet is not to arise.

53. [[And they went, each unto his own house;  

## John 8

1. but, Jesus, went unto the Mount of Olives.

2. And, early in the morning, again, came he into the temple, and all the people were coming unto him; and, sitting down, he began to teach them.

3. And the Scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman, caught, in adultery; and, setting her in the midst,

4. they say unto him—Teacher! this woman, hath been caught in the very act of committing adultery!

5. Now, in the law, Moses, [unto us] gave command to stone, such as these. What, then, dost, thou, say?

6. [This, however, they were saying, by way of testing him,—that they might have whereof to accuse him.] But, Jesus, stooping down, with his finger, wrote in the ground.

7. When, however, they still continued questioning him, he lifted himself up and said [unto them]—He of you, that is without sin, let him first cast at her a stone;

8. and, again stooping down, he wrote in the ground.

9. And, they who heard, began to go out, one by one, beginning from the elders,—and he was left, alone; the woman also, being, in the midst.

10. And lifting himself up, Jesus said unto her—Woman, where are they? Hath, no one, condemned thee?

11. And, she, said—No one, Sir! And Jesus said—Neither do, I, condemn thee,—be going thy way: Henceforth, be sinning, no more.]] 

12.  Again, therefore, unto them, spake Jesus, saying—I, am the light of the world: He that followeth me, shall in nowise walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

13. The Pharisees, therefore, said unto him—Thou, concerning thyself, bearest witness: thy witness, is not true.

14. Jesus answered, and said unto them—Even though, I, bear witness concerning myself, true, is my witness, because I know whence I came, and whither I go; but, ye, know not whence I come, and whither I go.

15. Ye, according to the flesh, do judge: I, am judging no one.

16. And, even if, I, am judging, my judging, is, genuine,—because, alone, am I not, but, I, and the Father who sent me;

17. And, in your own law, it is written, that, two men’s witness, is, true:

18. I, am the one bearing witness of myself, and the Father who sent me is bearing witness concerning me.

19. They were saying unto him, therefore—Where, is thy father? Jesus answered—Neither, me, do ye know, nor yet my Father: If, me, ye had known, my Father also, had ye known.

20. These sayings, spake he in the treasury, teaching in the temple, and yet, no one, seized him, because, not yet, had come his hour. 

21.  He said unto them again, therefore—I, go, and ye shall seek me,—and yet, in your sin, shall ye die: Whither, I, go, ye, cannot come.

22. The Jews, therefore, were saying—Can it be that he will kill himself, that he saith, Whither, I, go, ye, cannot come?

23. And he was saying unto them—Ye, are, of the realms below, I, am, of the realms above: Ye, are, of this world, I, am not of this world.

24. Therefore said I unto you, Ye shall die in your sins: For, if ye believe not that, I, am he, ye shall die in your sins.

25. They were saying unto him, therefore—Who art, thou? Jesus said unto them—First and foremost, even what I speak unto you.

26. Many things, have I, concerning you, to speak, and to judge; but, he who sent me, is, true, and, I, what things I heard from him, the same, speak I unto the world.

27. They noted not that, as touching the Father, unto them, he was speaking.

28. Jesus, therefore, said—Whensoever ye shall lift up the Son of Man, then, shall ye know, that, I, am he, and, of myself, am doing, nothing; but, just as the Father taught me, the same things, am I speaking.

29. And, he that sent me, is, with me: He hath not left me, alone. Because, I, the things that please him, ever do.

30. As he was speaking these things, many, believed on him. 

31.  Jesus was saying, therefore, unto the Jews who had believed on him—If, ye, abide in my word, of a truth, my disciples, ye are;

32. And ye shall know the truth, and, the truth, shall make you free.

33. They made answer unto him—Seed of Abraham, are we, and, unto no one, have been brought into bondage, at any time: How sayest, thou, Free, shall ye be made?

34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you: Every one who committeth sin, is, a slave, [of sin:]

35. Now, the slave, doth not abide in the house, evermore. The Son, abideth, evermore.

36. If then, the Son, shall make you free, really free, shall ye be.

37. I know that ye are, seed of Abraham; but ye are seeking to kill me, because, my word, findeth no place in you. 

38.  What things, I, have seen with the Father, I am speaking; Ye, also, then, what things ye have heard from your father, are doing.—

39. They answered and said unto him—Our father, is, Abraham. Jesus saith unto them—If, children of Abraham, ye are, the works of Abraham, are ye doing.

40. But, now, ye are seeking, to kill me,—A man who, the truth, unto you, hath spoken, which I have heard from God: this, Abraham, did not.

41. Ye, are doing the works of your father. They said unto him—We, of fornication, were not born: One father, have we—God.

42. Jesus said unto them—If, God, had been your father, ye had been loving me, for, I, from God, came forth, and am here; for, not even of myself, have I come, but, he, sent me forth.

43. Wherefore, is it, that, my speech, ye do not understand? because ye cannot hear my word.

44. Ye, are, of your father—the adversary, and, the covetings of your father, ye choose to be doing. He, was, a murderer, from the beginning, and, in the truth, he stood not; because truth is not in him: Whensoever he speaketh falsehood, of his own, he speaketh; because, false, he is, and, the father of it.

45. But, as for me, because, the truth, I speak, ye do not believe me. 

46.  Which of you convicteth me of sin? If, truth, I speak, wherefore, do, ye, not believe me?

47. He that is of God, heareth, the sayings of God; therefore, do, ye, not hear, because, of God, ye are not.

48. The Jews answered, and said unto him—Do, we, not, well, say: Thou, art, a Samaritan, and hast a demon?

49. Jesus answered—I, have not, a demon, but honour my Father: and, ye, dishonour me.

50. But, I, seek not my glory: There is one who seeketh and judgeth. 

51.  Verily, verily, I say unto you: If anyone shall keep, my word, death, shall he not see, unto times age-abiding.

52. The Jews said unto him—Now, we know that, a demon, thou hast:—Abraham, died, and, the prophets, and yet, thou, sayest: If anyone shall keep, my word, in nowise shall he taste of death, unto times age-abiding.

53. Surely, thou, art not, greater, than our father Abraham,—who, indeed, died? and, the prophets, died:—Whom, makest thou thyself?

54. Jesus answered—If, I, glorify myself, my glory, is nothing: It is, my Father, that glorifieth me,—of whom, ye, say—He is, your God!

55. And yet ye have not come to know him; but, I, do know him: If I say, I know him not, I shall be like you—false; but I know him, and, his word, am I keeping.

56. Abraham, your father, exulted that he should see my day; and he saw, and rejoiced.

57. The Jews, therefore, said unto him—Fifty years old, not yet art thou, and, Abraham, hast thou seen?

58. Jesus said unto them—Verily, verily, I say unto you: Before, Abraham, came into existence, I, am.

59. They took up stones, therefore, that they might cast at him; but, Jesus, was hidden, and went forth out of the temple.  

## John 9

1. And, passing along, he saw a man, blind from birth.

2. And his disciples questioned him, saying—Rabbi! who sinned, this man or his parents, that, blind, he should be born?

3. Jesus answered—Neither, this man, sinned nor his parents; but…that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

4. We must needs be working the works of him that sent me, while it is, day: There cometh a night, when, no one, can work.

5. Whensoever I may be, in the world, I am, the light, of the world.

6. These things, having said, he spat on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and laid the clay upon his eyes;

7. and said unto him—Withdraw! wash in the pool of Siloam,—which is to be translated, Sent. He went away, therefore, and washed, and came, seeing. 

8.  The neighbours, therefore, and they who used to observe him aforetime—that he was, a beggar, were saying—Is not, this, he that used to sit and beg?

9. Others, were saying—’Tis, the same. Others, were saying—Nay! but he is, like him. He, was saying—I, am he.

10. So they were saying unto him—How [then] were thine eyes opened?

11. He, answered—The man that is called Jesus, made, clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me: Withdraw unto the pool of Siloam, and wash. Going away, therefore, and washing, I received sight.

12. And they said unto him—Where is, He? He saith—I know not. 

13.  They bring him unto the Pharisees—him at one time blind.

14. Now it was Sabbath, on the day when Jesus made, the clay, and opened his eyes.

15. Again, therefore, the Pharisees also questioned him, as to how he received sight. And, he, said unto them—Clay, laid he upon mine eyes, and I washed,—and do see.

16. Certain from among the Pharisees, therefore, were saying—This man is not, from God, because, the Sabbath, he keepeth not. Others, [however] were saying—How can a sinful man, such signs as these, be doing? And there was, a division, among them.

17. So they were saying unto the blind man, again, What dost, thou, say concerning him, in that he opened thine eyes? And, he, said—A prophet, is he.

18. The Jews, therefore, did not believe, concerning him, that he was blind, and received sight,—until they called the parents of him that had received sight,

19. and questioned them, saying—Is, this, your son, of whom, ye, say, that blind, he was, born? How, then, seeth he, even now?

20. His parents, therefore, answered, and said—We know that, this, is our son, and that, blind, he was born;

21. But, how he now seeth, we know not, or, who opened his eyes, we, know not,—Question, him, he is, of age, he, concerning himself, shall speak.

22. These things, said his parents, because they were in fear of the Jews,—for, already, had the Jews agreed together, that, if anyone should confess, him, to be Christ, an, excommunicant from the synagogue, should he be made.

23. For this cause, his parents said—He is, of age,—question him.

24. So they called the man a second time—[him] who had been blind, and said unto him—Give glory unto God! We know that, this man, is, a sinner.

25. He, therefore, answered—Whether he is a sinner, I know not: One thing, I know,—That, whereas I was, blind, now, I see!

26. They said, therefore, unto him—What did he unto thee? How opened he thine eyes?

27. He answered them—I told you just now, and ye did not hear: Why, again, do ye wish to hear? Are, ye also, wishing to become, his disciples?

28. And they reviled him, and said—Thou, art, the disciple, of that man; but, we, are, Moses’, disciples:—

29. We, know, that, unto Moses, hath God spoken; but, as for this man, we know not whence he is.

30. The man answered, and said unto them—Why! Herein, is, the marvel: That, ye, know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes.

31. We know that, God, unto sinners, doth not hearken: but, if one be, a worshipper of God, and be doing, his will, unto this one, he hearkeneth.

32. Out of age-past time, hath it never been heard, that anyone opened the eyes of one who, blind, had been born.

33. If this man were not from God, he could have done nothing.

34. They answered and said unto him—In sins, wast, thou, born, altogether; and art, thou, teaching, us? And they cast him out. 

35.  Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and, finding him, said—Dost, thou, believe on the son of Man?

36. He answered [and said]—And, who, is he, Sir, that I may believe on him?

37. Jesus said unto him—Thou hast both seen him and, he that is speaking with thee, is, he.

38. And, he, said—I believe, Sir! and worshipped him. 

39.  And Jesus said—For judgment, I, unto this world, came: that, they who were not seeing, might see, and, they who were seeing, might become, blind.

40. They of the Pharisees who were with him, heard, these things, and said unto him—Are, we also, blind?

41. Jesus said unto them—If, blind, ye had been, ye had not had sin; but, now, ye say, We see, your sin, abideth.  

## John 10

1. Verily, verily, I say unto you:—He that entereth not, through the door, into the fold of the sheep, but goeth up from another place, that man, is, a thief, and, a robber.

2. But, he that entereth through the door, is, shepherd, of the sheep:

3. To him, the porter openeth, and, the sheep, unto his voice, hearken: and, his own sheep, he calleth by name, and leadeth them forth.

4. As soon as, all his own, he hath put forth, before them, he moveth on, and, the sheep, follow him, because they know his voice;

5. But, a stranger, will they in nowise follow, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice, of strangers.

6. This similitude, spake Jesus unto them; but, those men, understood not what the things were which he was speaking unto them.

7. Jesus, therefore, said, again—Verily, verily, I say unto you:—I, am the door of the sheep:

8. All, as many as came before me, are thieves, and, robbers: but the sheep hearkened nor unto them.

9. I, am the door: through me, if anyone enter, he shall be saved, and shall come in and go out, and, pasture, shall find.

10. The thief, cometh not, save that he may thieve and slay and destroy: I, came, that, life, they might have, and, above measure, might have.

11. I, am the good shepherd: The good shepherd, his life, layeth down, for the sheep.

12. The hireling, even because he is no shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, vieweth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth,—and, the wolf, seizeth them and scattereth,—

13. Because, a hireling, he is, and hath no care for the sheep.

14. I, am the good shepherd, and know my own, and, my own, know me,—

15. Just as, the Father, knoweth me, and, I, know, the Father; and, my life, I lay down for the sheep.

16. And, other sheep, have I, which are not of this fold: those also, I must needs bring, and, unto my voice, will they hearken, and there shall come to be, One flock, One shepherd.

17. Therefore, doth the Father, love, me, because, I, lay down my life, that, again, I may receive it:—

18. No one, forced it from me, but, I, lay it down, of myself,—Authority, have I, to lay it down, and, authority, have I, again, to receive it: This commandment, received I, from my Father. 

19.  A division, again, took place among the Jews, because of these words.

20. But many from among them were saying—A demon, he hath, and is raving,—Why, unto him, do ye hearken?

21. Others, said—These sayings, are not those of one demonized,—Can, a demon, open the eyes of, the blind? 

22.  The feast of dedication took place at that time, in Jerusalem: it was, winter,

23. and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon.

24. The Jews, therefore, surrounded him, and were saying unto him—How long, holdest thou, our lives, in suspense? If, thou, art the Christ, tell us, plainly.

25. Jesus answered them—I told you, and ye believe not: The works which, I, am doing in the name of my Father, the same, bear witness concerning me.

26. But, ye, believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.

27. My sheep, unto my voice, hearken,—and, I, know, them, and they follow me,—

28. And, I, give unto them life age-abiding, and in nowise shall they perish, unto times age-abiding; and no one shall carry them off out of my hand.

29. What, my Father, hath given me, is, something greater than all, and, no one, can carry off out of the hand of my Father:—

30. I and the Father, are, one.

31. The Jews again lifted up stones, that they might stone him.

32. Jesus answered them—Many works, have I showed you, noble ones, from my Father: For which of those works are ye stoning me?

33. The Jews answered him—Concerning a noble work, are we not stoning thee; but concerning profane speech,—and because, thou, being, a man, art making thyself, God.

34. Jesus answered them—Is it not written in your law: I, said, Ye are, gods?

35. If, those, he called gods, unto whom, the word of God, came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—

36. Of him whom, the Father, hallowed and sent forth into the world, are, ye, saying—Thou speakest profanely, because I said, Son of God, I am?

37. If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe in me;

38. But, if I am doing them, even though, in me, ye believe not, in the works, believe,—that ye may get to know and go on to know, that the Father is, in me, and, I, am, in the Father. 

39.  They were [therefore] again seeking to take him; and he went forth out of their hand.

40. And he went away again, beyond the Jordan, unto the place where John was at the first, immersing; and he abode there.

41. And, many, came unto him, and were saying—John, indeed, did not so much as, one sign; but, all things, whatsoever John said concerning this one, were, true.

42. And, many, believed on him there.  

## John 11

1. Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.

2. And Mary was she who anointed the Lord with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair—whose brother Lazarus was sick.

3. The sisters, therefore, sent out unto him, saying—Lord, see! he whom thou tenderly lovest, is sick.

4. But Jesus hearing, said—This sickness, is not unto death, but for the glory of God,—that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.

5. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

6. When, therefore, he heard that he was sick, then, indeed, he abode in the place where he was, two days.

7. Then, after this, he saith unto the disciples—Let us be leading on into Judaea, again.

8. The disciples say unto him—Rabbi! just now, were the Jews seeking to stone thee—and, again, goest thou thither?

9. Jesus answered—Are there not, twelve hours, in the day? If one walk in the day, he doth no stumble, because, the light of this world, he seeth;

10. But, if one walk in the night, he stumbleth, because, the light, is not in him.

11. These things, he said, and, after this, he saith unto them—Lazarus, our dear friend, hath fallen asleep; but I am going, that I may awake him.

12. The disciples, therefore, said unto him—Lord! if he have fallen asleep, he will recover.

13. But Jesus had spoken concerning his death; whereas, they, supposed that, concerning the taking of rest in sleep, he had been speaking.

14. Jesus, therefore, then, said unto them, plainly,—Lazarus, died;

15. and I rejoice, for your sake—that ye may believe,—that I was not there; but let us be going unto him.

16. Thomas, therefore, the one called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples—Let, us also, be going, that we may die with him. 

17.  Jesus, therefore, coming, found that, four days already, had he been in the tomb.

18. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;

19. and, many from among the Jews, had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might console them concerning their brother.

20. Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him; but, Mary, in the house, remained sitting.

21. Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus—Lord! if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;

22. And, now, I know, that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God, will give unto thee.

23. Jesus saith unto her—Thy brother shall rise.

24. Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise, in the resurrection, in the last day.

25. Jesus said unto her—I, am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, even though he die, shall live again!

26. And, no one who liveth again and believeth on me, shall in anywise die, unto times age-abiding. Believest thou this?

27. She saith unto him—Yea, Lord! I, have believed, that, thou, art the Christ, the Son of God,—He who, into the world, should come.

28. And this saying, she went away, and called Mary her sister, secretly, saying—The teacher, is present, and calleth thee.

29. And, she, when she heard, was roused up quickly, and was coming unto him.

30. Not yet, however, had Jesus come into the village, but was still in the place where, Martha, met him.

31. The Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house and consoling her, seeing Mary, that quickly she arose and went out, followed her, supposing that she was withdrawing unto the tomb, that she might weep there.

32. Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying unto him—Lord! if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 

33.  Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, was indignant in the spirit, and troubled himself,

34. and said—Where have ye laid him? They say unto him—Lord! come and see.

35. Jesus wept.

36. The Jews, therefore, were saying—See! how tenderly he loved him!

37. But, some from among them, said—Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that, this one also, should not have died?

38. Jesus, therefore, again, being indignant within himself, cometh unto the tomb. Now it was a cave, and, a stone, was lying thereon.

39. Jesus, saith, Take ye away the stone! Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith unto him—Lord! by this time, he stinketh, for it is, four days.

40. Jesus saith unto her—Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?

41. So they took away the stone. And, Jesus, lifted up his eyes on high, and said—Father! I thank thee, thou didst hear me:

42. I, indeed, knew that, always, unto me, thou dost hearken; but, for the sake of the multitude standing around, I spake,—that they might believe that, thou, didst send me forth.

43. And, these things, having said, with a loud voice, he cried out—Lazarus! Come forth!

44. He that was dead came forth, bound feet and hands with bandages, and, his face, with a napkin, was bound about. Jesus saith unto them—Loose him, and let him go. 

45.  Many therefore from among the Jews, who had come unto Mary, and gazed on what he did, believed on him

46. but, certain from among them, went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.

47. The High-priests and Pharisees, therefore, brought together a high-council, and were saying—What are we to do, in that, this man, doeth, many signs?

48. If we let him alone thus, all, will believe on him, and the Romans will come, and take away, both our place and nation.

49. But, a certain one from among them, Caiaphas, being, High-priest, for that year, said unto them—Ye, know, nothing at all;

50. nor do ye take into account, that it is profitable for you that, one man, should die for the people, and not, the whole nation, perish.

51. This, however, from himself, he spake not, but, being, High-priest, for that year, he prophesied, that Jesus was about to die for the nation;

52. and, not for the nation only, but that, the scattered children of God also, he might gather together into one.

53. From that day, therefore, they took counsel, that they might put him to death.

54. Jesus, therefore, no longer openly, was walking among the Jews, but departed thence, into the country near the desert, unto a city called, Ephraim; and, there, abode, with his disciples.

55. Now the passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up unto Jerusalem, out of the country, before the passover, that they might purify themselves.

56. They were therefore seeking Jesus, and were saying one to another, in the temple, standing—How seemeth it unto you? that he will in nowise come unto the feast?

57. Now the High-priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that, if anyone came to know where he was, he should inform [them], so that they might seize him.  

## John 12

1. Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came unto Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from among the dead.

2. So they made for him a supper, there; and, Martha, was ministering, but, Lazarus, was one of them who were reclining with him.

3. Mary, therefore, taking a pound of pure nard perfume, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped, with her hair, his feet; and, the house, was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

4. [But] Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, he that was about to deliver him up, saith—

5. Why was, this perfume, not sold for three hundred denaries, and given unto the destitute?

6. Howbeit he said this, not that, for the destitute, he cared, but because, a thief, he was, and holding, the bag, used to carry away, what was cast therein.

7. Jesus, therefore, said—Let her alone, that, for the day of my burial, she may observe it;

8. For, the destitute, always, have ye with you, whereas, me, not always, have ye.

9. The great multitude of the Jews, therefore, got to know that he was, there, and came, not on account of Jesus only, but that, Lazarus also, they might see, whom he had raised from among the dead.

10. But the High-priests took counsel, that Lazarus also, they might put to death;

11. because, many of the Jews, by reason of him, were withdrawing, and believing on Jesus. 

12.  On the morrow, the great multitude that had come unto the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,

13. took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and began crying aloud—Hosanna! Blessed is he that is coming in the name of the Lord,—even the King of Israel!

14. And Jesus, finding a young ass, took his seat thereon, just as it is written—

15. Do not fear, O daughter of Zion! Lo! thy king, cometh, sitting upon the colt of an ass.

16. These things, his disciples noticed not, at the first; but, when Jesus was glorified, then, remembered they that, these things, had, for him, been written,—and that, these things, they had done unto him.

17. The multitude, therefore, that was with him when he called, Lazarus, out of the tomb, and raised him from among the dead, was bearing witness.

18. On this account, the multitude met him also, because they heard that he had done, this sign.

19. the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves—Ye observe that ye are profiting nothing: See! the world, after him, hath gone away. 

20.  Now there were certain Greeks, from among them who were coming up that they might worship in the feast.

21. These, therefore, came unto Philip, him who was from Bethsaida of Galilee,—and were requesting him, saying—Sir! We desire to see, Jesus.

22. Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew: Andrew and Philip come, and tell Jesus.

23. But, Jesus, answereth them, saying—The hour hath come, that the Son of Man should be glorified!

24. Verily! Verily, I say unto you: Except, the kernel of wheat, shall fall into the ground, and die, it, alone, abideth; but, if it die, much fruit, it beareth.

25. He that loveth his life, loseth it; but, he that hateth his life, in this world, unto life age-abiding, shall guard it.

26. If, with me, anyone be ministering, with me, let him be following; and, where, I, am, there, my minister also, shall be. If anyone, with me, be ministering, the Father, will honour him. 

27.  Now, is my soul troubled,—and what can I say? Father! save me from this hour? But, on this account, came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name!

28. There came, therefore, a voice out of heaven—I both have glorified it, and will glorify it again.

29. [So], the multitude that was standing by, and heard it, were saying—It hath, thundered. Others, were saying—A messenger, unto him, hath spoken.

30. Jesus answered, and said—Not for my sake, hath this voice come, but, for your sake.

31. Now, is there, a judging, of this world,—Now, the ruler of this world, shall be cast out;

32. And, I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw, all, unto myself.

33. But, this, he was saying, signifying, by what manner of death, he was about to die.

34. The multitude, therefore, answered him—We, have heard, out of the law, that, the Christ, abideth evermore; How then dost, thou, say,—It behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?

35. Jesus, therefore, said unto them—Yet a little while, the light, is, among you: Walk, while ye have, the light, lest, darkness, on you should lay hold; and, he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he drifteth.

36. While, the light, ye have, believe on the light, that, sons of light, ye may become. These things, spake Jesus,—and, departing, was hid from them. 

37.  And, although such signs, as these, he had done before them, they were not believing on him:—

38. that, the word of Isaiah the prophet, might be fulfilled, which said—Lord! who believed, what we have heard? And, the arm of the Lord, to whom, was it revealed?

39. On this account, they could not believe, because, again, said Isaiah—

40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; lest they should see with their eyes, and should understand with their heart, and should turn,—and I should heal them.

41. These things, said Isaiah, because he saw his glory, and spake concerning him. 

42.  Nevertheless, however, even from among the rulers, many believed on him; but, because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing him, lest, excommunicants from the synagogue, they should be made;

43. for they loved the glory of men, more than the glory of God. 

44.  And, Jesus, cried aloud, and said—He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me;

45. And, he that vieweth me, vieweth him that sent me.

46. I, a light, into the world have come, that, no one who believeth on me, in darkness, should abide.

47. And, if anyone shall hearken unto my sayings, and not guard them, I, am not judging him; for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.

48. He that setteth me aside, and receiveth not my sayings, hath that which is to judge him: The word that I spake, that, will judge him, in the last day.

49. Because, I, out of myself, spake not, but, the Father who sent me, hath, himself, given me commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

50. And I know that, his commandment, is, life age-abiding; The things, therefore, which I speak, just as the Father hath told me, so, I speak.  

## John 13

1. Now, before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come, that he should remove out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own that were in the world, unto the end, loved them.

2. And, supper, being in progress, the adversary, having already thrust into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot, that he should deliver him up,—

3. [Jesus] knowing that, all things, the Father had given unto him, into his hands, and that, from God, he had come, and, unto God, he was going,

4. rouseth himself out of the supper, and layeth aside his garments, and taking a linen cloth, girded himself.

5. Next, he poureth water into the wash-basin, and began to be washing the feet of the disciples, and to be wiping them with the linen cloth wherewith he was girded.

6. So he cometh unto Simon Peter. He saith unto him—Lord, dost, thou, wash my feet?

7. Jesus answered, and said unto him—What, I, am doing, thou, knowest not, as yet; howbeit, thou shalt got to know, hereafter.

8. Peter saith unto him—In nowise shalt thou, ever, wash my feet. Jesus answered him—If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

9. Simon Peter saith unto him—Lord! not my feet only, but my hands also, and my head.

10. Jesus saith unto him—He that hath bathed himself, hath no need [save as to the feet] to get washed; but is pure, as a whole. And, ye, are, pure, but not ye, all.

11. For he know the man that was delivering him up; therefore, said he—Not ye all, are pure.

12. When, therefore, he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and reclined, again said he unto them—Are ye taking note, what I have done unto you?

13. Ye, call me, The Teacher, and, The Lord,—and, well, say, for I am.

14. If then, I, have washed your feet,—[I] The Lord, and, The Teacher, ye also, ought to wash, one another’s, feet;

15. For, an example, have I given you,—that, just as, I, did unto you, ye also, should be doing.

16. Verily, verily, I say unto you—A servant is not greater than his lord, neither one sent forth greater than he that sent him.

17. If, these things, ye know, happy, are ye, if ye be doing them. 

18.  Not, concerning you all, am I speaking,—for, I, know of whom I made choice; but…that, the Scripture, might be fulfilled: He that feedeth on my bread, hath lifted up against me, his heel.

19. Henceforth, I tell you, before it cometh to pass,—that ye may believe, whensoever it doth come to pass, that, I, am he.

20. Verily, verily, I say unto you—He that receiveth whomsoever I shall send, receiveth, me; and, he that receiveth, me, receiveth him that sent me.

21. These things, having said, Jesus, was troubled in spirit, and bare witness, and said—Verily, verily, I say unto you—One from among you, will deliver me up.

22. The disciples began to look one at another, being at a loss concerning whom he was speaking.

23. One of Jesus’ disciples was reclining in his bosom, one whom Jesus loved:

24. so Simon Peter beckoneth unto the same, and saith unto him—Say, Who is it? concerning whom he speaketh.

25. He, falling back thus, upon the breast of Jesus, saith unto him—Lord! who is it?

26. Jesus, therefore, answereth—That one, it is, for whom, I, shall dip the morsel, and give unto him. So, dipping the morsel, he taketh and giveth it unto Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.

27. And, after the morsel, then, entered, Satan, into that man. Jesus, therefore, saith unto him—What thou art doing, do quickly!

28. But, as to this, none of them who were reclining with him knew respecting what, he said it to him.

29. For, some, were thinking, since Judas held the bag, that Jesus was saying to him—Buy the things of which we have, need, for the feast; or that, unto the destitute, he should give something.

30. So, he, taking the morsel, went out straightway;—and it was night. 

31.  When, therefore, he had gone out, Jesus saith—Just now, was, the Son of Man, glorified, and, God, was glorified in him;

32. And, God, will glorify him, in himself,—and, straightway, glorify him.

33. Dear children! Yet a little, am I, with you. Ye shall seek me, and, just as I said unto the Jews, Whither, I, go, ye, cannot come, unto you also, I say it, even now.

34. A new commandment, give I unto you,—That ye be loving one another: Just as I loved you, that, ye also, be loving one another:

35. By this, shall all men take knowledge, that, my disciples, ye are,—If ye have, love, one to another. 

36.  Simon Peter saith unto him—Lord! whither dost thou withdraw? Jesus answered—Whither I withdraw, thou canst not, now, follow me, but thou shalt follow, hereafter.

37. Peter saith unto him—Lord! why, cannot I follow thee, even now? My life, in thy behalf, will I lay down.

38. Jesus answereth—Thy life, in my behalf, wilt thou lay down? Verily, verily, I say unto thee—In nowise shall a cock crow till thou hast denied me, thrice.  

## John 14

1. Let not your heart be troubled: Believe on God, and, on me, believe.

2. In the house of my Father, are, many dwellings; or else I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you.

3. And, if I go, and prepare a place for you, again, am I coming, and will take you home unto—myself, that, where, I, am, ye also, may be. 

4.  And, whither, I, go, ye know, the way.

5. Thomas saith unto him—Lord! we know not whither thou goest: How know we, the way?

6. Jesus saith unto him—I, am the way, and the truth, and the life: No one, cometh unto the Father, but through me.

7. If ye had been getting to know me, my Father also, had ye known: from henceforth, are ye getting to know him, and have seen him.

8. Philip saith unto him—Lord! show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

9. Jesus saith unto him—So long a time as this, have I been, with you,—and thou hast not come to know me, Philip? He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father. How art, thou, saying, Show us the Father?

10. Believest thou not, that, I, am in the Father, and, the Father, is, in me? The things which I am saying unto you, from myself, I speak not; but, the Father, within me abiding, doeth his works.

11. Believe me, That, I, am in the Father, and, the Father, in me;—or else, on account of the works themselves, believe ye. 

12.  Verily, verily, I say unto you—He that believeth on me, the works which, I, am doing, he also, shall do; and, greater than these, shall he do, because, I, unto the Father, am going,—

13. And because, whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, the same, will I do, that, the Father, may be glorified, in the Son:

14. If anything ye shall ask [me] in my name, the same, will I do. 

15.  If ye be loving me, my commandments, ye will keep;

16. And, I, will request the Father, and, Another Advocate, will he give unto you, that he may be with you age-abidingly,

17. The Spirit of truth,—which, the world, cannot receive, because it beholdeth it not, nor getteth to know it. But, ye, are getting to know it; because, with you, it abideth, and, in you, it is. 

18.  I will not leave you bereft,—I am coming unto you.

19. Yet a little, and, the world, no longer beholdeth me; but, ye, behold me,—Because, I, live, ye also, shall live.

20. In that day, shall ye get to know, That, I, am in my Father, and, ye, in me, and, I, in you.

21. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he, it is that loveth me; and, he that loveth me, shall be loved by my Father, and, I, will love him, and will manifest, myself, unto him.

22. Judas, not the Iscariot, saith unto him—Lord! what hath happened, that, unto us, thou art about to manifest thyself, and, not unto the world?

23. Jesus answered, and said unto him—If any man be loving me, my word, he will keep, and, my Father, will love him,—and, unto him, will we come, and, an abode with him, will we make.

24. He that loveth me not, doth not keep, my word;—and, the word which ye hear, is not mine, but, the Father’s who sent me. 

25.  These things, have I spoken unto you, With you abiding;

26. But, the Advocate, The Holy Spirit, which the Father will send in my name, He, will teach you all things, and will put you in mind, of all things which, I, told you.

27. Peace, I leave with you, My own peace, give, I, unto you,—Not as, the world, giveth, give, I, unto you:—Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 

28.  Ye heard that, I, said unto you—I go my way, and I come unto you,—Had ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, that I am going unto the Father, for, the Father, is, greater than I.

29. But, now, have I told you, before it cometh to pass, that, whensoever it shall come to pass, ye may believe.

30. No longer, many things, will I speak with you; for, the world’s ruler, is coming, and, in me, hath, nothing,—

31. But, that the world may get to know that I love the Father, and just as the Father hath given me commandment, so, I do. Be rousing yourselves! let us be leading on from hence.  

## John 15

1. I, am the real vine, and, my Father, is, the husbandman.

2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, He taketh it away; and, every one that beareth, fruit, He pruneth it, that, more fruit, it may bear.

3. Already, ye, are, pure, because of the word which I have spoken unto you:

4. Abide in me, and, I, in you. Just as, the branch, cannot be bearing fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, so, neither, ye, except, in me, ye abide.

5. I, am the vine: Ye, are the branches. He that abideth in me and, I, in him, the same, beareth much fruit; because, apart from me, ye can bring forth, nothing.

6. If one abide not me, he is cast out as the branch, and withered, and they gather them,—and, into fire, they cast them, and they are burned.

7. If ye abide in me, and, my sayings, in you, abide, whatsoever ye may be desiring, ask! and it shall be brought to pass for you.

8. Herein, was my Father glorified, that, much fruit, ye should bear, and become my disciples. 

9.  Just as the Father loved me, I also, loved you: Abide ye in my love.

10. If, my commandments, ye keep, ye shall abide in my love,—just as, I, the Father’s commandments, have kept, and abide in his love.

11. These things, have I spoken unto you, that, my own joy, in you, may be, and, your joy, may be made full.

12. This, is my own commandment, That ye be loving one another, just as I loved you.

13. Greater love than this, hath, no one, That, his life, one should lay down in behalf of his friends.

14. Ye, are, friends of mine, if ye be doing that which, I, am commanding you.

15. No longer, do I call you, servants, for, the servant, knoweth not what, his lord, is doing. But, you, I have called, friends, because, all things which I heard from my Father, made I known unto you.

16. Not, ye, chose, me, but, I, chose you, and placed you, that ye should go your way and bear, fruit,—and, your fruit, should abide: that, whatsoever ye should ask the Father in my name, he might give unto you.

17. These things, I command you, That ye be loving one another. 

18.  If, the world, is hating, you, ye are getting to know that, me, before you, it hath hated.

19. If, of the world, ye had been, the world, of its own, had been fond; but, because, of the world, ye are not, on the contrary, I, chose you out of the world, therefore, the world, doth hate you.

20. Remember the word which, I, spake unto you: A servant is not greater than his lord. If, me, they persecuted, you too, will they persecute,—If, my word, they kept, your own also, will they keep.

21. But, all these things, will they do unto you, on account of my name, because they know not him that sent me.

22. Had I not come and spoken unto them, Sin, had they none; but, now, have they no, excuse, for their sin.

23. He that hateth me, hateth, my Father also.

24. Had I not done among them, the works, which, no other, had done, sin, had they none; but, now, have they, both seen and hated both me and my Father.

25. But…that the word which, in their law, is written, might be fulfilled—They hated me without cause. 

26.  Whensoever the Advocate shall come, Whom, I, will send unto you from the Father, The Spirit of truth, which, from the Father, cometh forth, He, will bear witness concerning me;

27. And do, ye also, bear witness, because, from the beginning, ye are, with me,  

## John 16

1. These things, have I spoken unto you, that ye may not be caused to stumble:

2. Excommunicants from the synagogue, will they make you; Nay! there cometh an hour, that, every one who killeth you, shall think to be rendering, divine service, unto God!

3. And, these things, will they do, because they got to know, neither the Father nor me.

4. But, these things, have I told you,—That, whensoever their hour shall come, ye may remember, that, thereof, I told you. These things, however, I told you not, from the beginning, because I was, with you;

5. But, now, I go my way unto him that sent me, and, not one from among you, questioneth me—Whither goest thou?

6. But, because, these things, I have told you, sorrow, hath filled your heart. 

7.  But, I, the truth, am telling you—It is profitable for you, that, I, depart; for, if I should not depart, The Advocate, would in nowise come unto you, but, if I go, I will send him unto you.

8. And, having come, He, will reprove the world—Concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment:

9. Concerning sin, indeed, because they are not believing on me;

10. But, concerning righteousness, because, unto the Father, I go my way, and, no longer, do ye behold me;

11. And, concerning judgment, because, the ruler of this world, hath been judged.

12. Yet many things, have I, unto you, to be saying,—but ye cannot bear them, just now;

13. Howbeit, as soon as, he, hath come—The Spirit of truth, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak from himself, but, whatsoever he heareth, he will speak, and, the coming things, will he announce unto you.

14. He, shall glorify me; for, of mine, shall he receive, and announce unto you.

15. All things, whatsoever the Father hath, are, my own; therefore, said I—Of mine, shall he receive, and announce unto you. 

16.  A little while, and, no longer, ye behold me; and, again a little while, and ye shall see me.

17. Some of his disciples, therefore, said one to another—What is this which he is saying to us:—A little while, and ye behold me not, and, again a little while, and ye shall see me; and—Because I go my way unto the Father?

18. They were saying, therefore—What is this which he saith:—A little while? We know not [what he is saying].

19. Jesus took note, that they were wishing to question him, and said unto them—Concerning this, are ye enquiring one with another,—because I said:—A little while, and ye behold me not, and, again, a little while, and ye shall see me?

20. Verily, verily, I say unto you—Ye, shall weep and lament, but, the world, shall rejoice: Ye, shall be grieved, but, your grief, into joy, shall be turned.

21. A woman, as soon as she is about to bring forth, hath, grief, because her hour hath come; but, as soon as she hath given birth to the child, no longer, remembereth she the anguish, by reason of the joy, that a human being into the world hath been born.

22. And, ye, therefore, now, indeed have grief; but, again, will I see you, and your heart shall rejoice,—and, your joy, no one, shall force from you. 

23.  And, in that day, shall ye request me, nothing:—Verily, verily, I say unto you—Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father, He will give you, in my name.

24. Until even now, ye have asked nothing in my name: Be asking, and ye shall receive,—that, your joy, may be made full.

25. These things, in similitudes, have I spoken unto you: There cometh an hour, when, no longer in similitudes, will I speak unto you, but, openly, concerning the Father, will I tell you.

26. In that day, In my name, shall ye ask:—and I say not that, I, will request the Father for you;

27. For, the Father himself, dearly loveth you, because, ye, have dearly loved me, and believed that, I, from the Father, came forth:— 

28.  I came forth out of the Father, and have come into the world,—Again, I leave the world, and go, unto the Father.

29. His disciples say—See! now, openly, art thou speaking, and, not a single similitude, art thou using:

30. Now, we know, that thou knowest all things, and hast, no need, that one be questioning thee. Hereby, do we believe, that, from God, thou camest forth.

31. Jesus answered them—As yet, ye believe:

32. Lo! there cometh an hour, and hath come, that ye should be scattered, each, unto his own home; and, me, alone, should leave;—And yet I am not, alone, but, the Father, is, with me!

33. These things, have I spoken unto you, that, in me, ye may have, peace: In the world, ye have, tribulation; but be taking courage,—I, have overcome the world.  

## John 17

1. These things, spake Jesus, and, lifting up his eyes unto heaven, said:—Father! The hour is come! Glorify thy Son, that, the Son, may glorify, thee,—

2. Even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that, as touching whatsoever thou hast given him, he might give unto them, life age-abiding.

3. And, this, is the age-abiding life, That they get to know thee, the only real God, and him whom thou didst send, Jesus Christ.

4. I, glorified thee on the earth, The work, finishing, which thou hast given me that I should do.

5. And, now, glorify me—thou, Father! with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world’s existence, with thee. 

6.  I manifested thy name, unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: Thine, they were, and, to me, thou gavest them, and, thy word, have they kept:

7. Now, have they come to know, That, all things, as many as thou gavest me, are, from thee;

8. And, the declarations which thou gavest me, have I given them, and, they, received them, and came to know in truth, that, from thee, came I forth,—and they believed, that, thou, didst send me forth.

9. I, concerning them, make request: not, concerning the world, do I make request, but concerning them whom thou hast given me, because, thine, they are,—

10. And, all my possessions, are, thine, and, thy possessions, mine, and I have been glorified in them. 

11.  And, no longer, am I in the world, and, they, are, in the world,—and, I, unto thee, am coming. Holy Father! Keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, as, we.

12. When I was with them, I, kept them in thy name which thou hast given me,—And I kept watch, and, none from among them, went the destruction,—save the son of destruction, that, the Scripture, might be fulfilled.

13. But, now, unto thee, am I coming; and, these things, am I speaking in the world, that they may have my own joy fulfilled in themselves.

14. I, have given them thy word, and, the world, hated them, because they are not of the world—even as, I, am not of the world.

15. I request not, that thou wouldst take them out of the world, but that thou wouldst keep them out of the evil:

16. Of the world, they are not, even as, I, am not of the world. 

17.  Hallow them in the truth: Thine own word, is, truth:

18. Even as thou didst send me forth into the world, I also, send them forth into the world;

19. And, on their behalf, I, hallow myself, that, they also, may have become hallowed in truth. 

20.  Not however concerning these alone, do I make request, but, concerning them also who believe, through their word, on me:

21. That they, all, may be, one,—even as, thou, Father, in me, and, I, in thee,—that, they also, in us, may be;—that, the world, may believe that, thou, didst send me forth.

22. And, I, the glory which thou hast given to me, have given to them, that they may be one, even as, we, are, one.—

23. I, in them and, thou, in me; That they may have been perfected into, one,—That the world may get to know, that, thou, didst send me forth, and didst love them even as thou didst love, me. 

24.  Father! As touching that which thou hast given me, I desire—That, where, I, am, they also, may be, with me, that they may behold my own glory which thou hast given me,—because thou lovedst me, before the foundation of the world.

25. Righteous Father! And so, the world, came not to know thee; but, I, came to know thee, and, these, came to know that, thou, didst send me forth:

26. And I made known unto them thy name, and will make known,—that, the love wherewith thou lovedst me, in them, may be, and, I, in them.  

## John 18

1. Having said these things, Jesus, went out, with his disciples, across the winter-torrent of the Kedron, where was a garden,—into which he entered, he, and his disciples.

2. Now, Judas also, who was delivering him up, knew the place: because, oft, had Jesus been gathered there, with his disciples.

3. Judas, therefore, receiving the band, and officers, from among the High-priests and [from among] the Pharisees, cometh thither, with lights and torches and weapons.

4. Jesus, therefore, knowing all the things coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them—Whom, seek ye?

5. They answered him—Jesus, the Nazarene. He saith unto them—I, am he. Now Judas also, who was delivering him up, was standing with them.

6. When, therefore, he said unto them, I, am he, they went backwards, and fell to the ground.

7. Again, therefore, he questioned them—Whom, seek ye? And, they, said—Jesus, the Nazarene.

8. Jesus answered—I told you, I, am he. If, then, ye seek me, let these go their way:—

9. that the word might be fulfilled which he had said—As touching them whom thou hast given me, I lost from among them, not so much as one.

10. Simon Peter, therefore, having a sword, drew it, and smote the High-priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.

11. Jesus, therefore, said unto Peter—Thrust the sword into its sheath:—The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I in anywise not drink it?

12. The band, therefore, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, apprehended Jesus, and bound him, 

13.  and led him unto Annas, first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the High-priest of that year.

14. Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel unto the Jews, that it was profitable for, one man, to die in behalf of the people.

15. And Simon Peter was following with Jesus, also another disciple. But, that disciple, was known unto the High-priest, and entered in, with Jesus, into the court of the High-priest;

16. whereas, Peter, remained standing at the door outside. The other disciple, therefore, that was known of the High-priest, went out, and spake unto the portress, and brought in Peter.

17. The female servant, therefore, the portress, saith unto Peter—Art, thou also, from among the disciples of this man? He, saith—I am not!

18. Now the servants and the officers were standing by, having made, a coal fire, because it was cold,—and were warming themselves; and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.

19. The High-priest, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching.

20. Jesus answered him—I, openly, have spoken, unto the world,—I, ever, taught, in synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews gather together; and, in secret, spake nothing:

21. Why questionest thou me? question them who have heard, what I spake unto them. See! these, know what, I, said.

22. And, when, these things, he had said, one of the officers who was standing by, gave a smart blow to Jesus, saying—Thus, answerest thou, the High-priest?

23. Jesus answered him—If, with abuse, I spake, bear witness of the abuse: but, if with respect, why, smitest thou me?

24. Annas therefore sent him forth, bound, unto Caiaphas the High-priest.

25. Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said, therefore, unto him—Art, thou also, from among his disciples? He, denied, and said—I am not!

26. Saith one from among the servants of the High-priest, being, kinsman, of him whose ear Peter cut off,—Did not, I, see thee, in the garden with him?

27. Again, therefore, Peter denied. And, straightway, a cock crew. 

28.  So they lead Jesus from Caiaphas unto the judgment-hall. Now it was early; and, they themselves, entered not into the judgment-hall, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.

29. Pilate, therefore, went forth outside unto them, and saith,—What accusation bring ye against this man?

30. They answered and said unto him—If this one had not been doing, mischief, unto thee, had we not delivered him up.

31. Pilate, therefore, said unto them—Ye, take him, and, according to your law, judge ye him. The Jews said unto him—Unto us, it is not allowed, to kill anyone!—

32. that, the word of Jesus, might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying, by what manner of death, he was about to die.

33. Pilate, therefore, entered again into the judgment-hall; and addressed Jesus, and said unto him—Art, thou, the king of the Jews?

34. Jesus answered—Of thyself, art, thou, this thing saying; or did, others, tell thee concerning me?

35. Pilate answered—Am, I, a Jew? Thine own nation, and the High-priests, delivered thee up, unto me! What, hast thou done?

36. Jesus answered—My kingdom, is not of this world: If, of this world, had been my kingdom, mine own officers, would have been striving, that I should not be delivered up unto the Jews: but, now, my kingdom, is not from hence.

37. Pilate, therefore, said unto him—And yet, thou, art, not a king? Jesus answered—Thou, sayest, that, a king, I am: I, for this, have been born, and, for this, have come into the world,—that I may bear witness unto the truth: Every one who is of the truth, hearkeneth unto my voice.

38. Pilate saith unto him—What, is truth? And, this saying, again, went he out to the Jews, and saith unto them,—I, find in him, not a single fault.

39. Howbeit ye have, a custom, that, some one, I should release unto you, during the passover:—Are ye minded, then, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?

40. So they cried aloud again, saying—Not this man, but Barabbas! Now, Barabbas, was, a robber.  

## John 19

1. Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus, and scourged him.

2. And, the soldiers, plaiting a crown out of thorns, placed it upon his head, and, a purple robe, cast they about him;

3. and kept coming unto him, and saying—Joy to thee! O King of the Jews!—and were giving unto him smart blows.

4. And Pilate went forth again outside, and saith unto them—See! I lead him unto you outside, that ye may take knowledge, that, no single fault, do I find in him.

5. Jesus, therefore, came forth outside, wearing the thorn crown, and the purple mantle. And he saith unto them—Lo! the Man!

6. When, therefore, the High-priests and the officers saw him, they cried aloud, saying—Crucify! Crucify! Pilate saith unto them—Ye, take him, and crucify; for, I, find not in him, a fault.

7. The Jews answered him—We, have, a law, and, according to the law, he ought to die, because, Son of God, himself, he made.

8. When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid;

9. and entered into the judgment-hall again, and saith unto Jesus—Whence, art, thou? But, Jesus, gave him no, answer.

10. Pilate, therefore, saith unto him—Unto me, dost thou not speak? Knowest thou not, that, authority, have I to release thee, and, authority, have I to crucify thee?

11. Jesus answered him—Thou couldst have had no authority against me, at all, if it had not been given unto thee from above. Therefore, he that delivered me unto thee, hath, greater sin.

12. For this cause, Pilate, began seeking to release him; but, the Jews, cried aloud saying—If this man thou release, thou art not a friend of Caesar, for, every one who maketh himself king, speaketh against Caesar.

13. Pilate, therefore, when he heard these words, led Jesus outside, and sat down upon a raised seat, in a place called Pavement, but, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

14. Now it was the preparation of the passover,—it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews—See! your King!

15. They, therefore, cried aloud—Away! away! Crucify him! Pilate saith unto them—Your king, shall I crucify? The High-priests answered—We have no king but Caesar! 

16.  Then, therefore, he delivered him up unto them, that he might be crucified. They took possession, therefore, of Jesus.

17. And, bearing for himself the cross, he went forth unto the so-called Skull-place, which is named, in Hebrew, Golgotha;

18. where, him, they crucified; and, with him, other two, on this side and on that, and, in the midst, Jesus. 

19.  And Pilate wrote a title also, and placed on the cross; and there was written—JESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. This title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because, near, was the place to the city where Jesus was crucified; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, in Greek.

21. The High-priests of the Jews, therefore, were saying unto Pilate—Do not be writing, The King of the Jews; but that, he, said: King of the Jews, I am.

22. Pilate answered—What I have written, I have written!

23. The soldiers, therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, unto each soldier, a part; also the tunic. Howbeit, the tunic was without seam, from above, woven throughout.

24. They said, therefore, one to another—Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose, it shall be;—that, the Scripture, might be fulfilled—They parted my garments amongst them, and, for my vestment, they cast lots:—yes verily, the soldiers, these things did.

25. And there were standing by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene.

26. Jesus, therefore, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved, saith unto his mother—O woman, see! thy son!

27. Afterwards, he saith unto the disciple—See! thy mother! And, from that hour, the disciple took her unto his own home.

28. After this, Jesus, knowing that, already, all things, have been finished,—that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith—I thirst!

29. A vessel, was standing, full of vinegar. A sponge, therefore, full of the vinegar, put about, hyssop, brought they unto his mouth.

30. When, therefore, he had received the vinegar, Jesus said—It is finished! And, bowing his head, delivered up his spirit. 

31.  The Jews, therefore, since it was, a preparation, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross during the Sabbath,—for that Sabbath day was, great, requested Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they be taken away.

32. The soldiers, therefore, came; and, of the first, indeed, brake the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,—

33. but coming, unto Jesus, when they saw that, already, he was dead, they brake not his legs;—

34. but, one of the soldiers, with a spear, pierced, his side, and there came out, straightway, blood and water.

35. And, he that hath seen, hath borne witness; and, genuine, is his testimony, and, he, knoweth that he saith, what is true, that, ye also, may believe.

36. For these things came to pass, that, the Scripture, might be fulfilled—A bone thereof, shall not be crushed;

37. and, again, a different Scripture, saith—They shall look unto him whom they pierced. 

38.  But, after these things, Joseph from Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but having kept it secret for fear of the Jews, requested Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave permission. He came, therefore, and took away his body.

39. There came, moreover, Nicodemus also,—he that came unto him by night at the first,—bearing a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds’ weight.

40. So they received the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen-bandages with the spices,—just as it is, a custom, with the Jews to prepare for burial.

41. Now there was, in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and, in the garden, an unused tomb, wherein, as yet, no one had been laid.

42. So, there, by reason of the preparation of the Jews, because, near, was the tomb, laid they Jesus.  

## John 20

1. But, on the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene, cometh early, while it is yet, dark, unto the tomb,—and beholdeth the stone, already taken away out of the tomb.

2. She runneth, therefore, and cometh unto Simon Peter, and unto the other disciple whom Jesus dearly loved, and saith unto them—They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.

3. Peter, therefore, went out, and the other disciple,—and they were going unto the tomb;

4. and the two were running together, and, the other disciple, outran Peter, and came first unto the tomb;

5. and, stooping aside, beholdeth, lying, the linen-bandages, nevertheless, he entered not.

6. So Simon Peter also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb, and vieweth the linen-bandages lying,—

7. and the napkin, which was upon his head, not, with the linen-bandages, lying, but apart, folded up into one place.

8. Then, entered, therefore, the other disciple also, who had come first unto the tomb, and he saw and believed.

9. For, not yet, knew they the Scripture, that he must needs, from among the dead, arise.

10. The disciples, therefore, departed again, by themselves. 

11.  Howbeit, Mary, remained standing against the tomb, outside, weeping. So then, as she wept, she stooped aside into the tomb,

12. and beholdeth two messengers, in white garments, sitting, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where had been lying the body of Jesus.

13. And, they, say unto her—Woman! why weepest thou? She saith unto them—They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.

14. These things saying, she turned round, and seeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was, Jesus.

15. Jesus saith unto her—Woman! why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing he was, the gardener, saith unto him—Sir! If, thou, hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him; and, I, will take him away.

16. Jesus saith unto her—Mary! She, turning saith unto him, in Hebrew—Rabboni! which meaneth, Teacher.

17. Jesus saith unto her—Be not detaining me, for, not yet, have I ascended unto the Father; but be going unto my disciples, and say unto them—I am ascending unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.

18. Mary the Magdalene cometh, bringing tidings unto the disciples—I have seen the Lord! and that these things he had said unto her. 

19.  It being late, therefore, on that day, the first of the week,—and, the doors, having been made fast where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and stood in the midst, and saith unto them—Peace be unto you!

20. and, this, saying he pointed out both his hands and his side unto them. The disciples, therefore, rejoiced, seeing the Lord.

21. Jesus, therefore, said unto them, again,—Peace be unto you! Just as, my Father, sent me forth, I, also, send you.

22. And, this, saying, he breathed strongly, and saith unto them—Receive ye Holy Spirit:—

23. Whosesoever sins ye shall remit, they are remitted unto them, whosesoever ye shall retain, they are retained.

24. But, Thomas, one of the twelve, the one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

25. The other disciples, therefore, were saying unto him—We have seen the Lord! But, he, said unto them—Except I see, in his hands, the print of the nails, and press my finger into the print of the nails, and press my hand into his side, in nowise will I believe. 

26.  And, eight days after, his disciples again were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh—the doors having been made fast—and stood in the midst, and said—Peace be unto you!

27. Then, saith he unto Thomas—Reach thy finger hither, and see my hands, and reach thy hand, and press into my side,—and become not disbelieving, but believing.

28. Thomas answered, and said unto him—My Lord, and my God!

29. Jesus saith unto him—Because thou hast seen me, hast thou believed? Happy, they who have not seen, and yet have believed!

30. Many other signs, doubtless, did Jesus, in presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;

31. but, these, are written, that ye may believe that, Jesus, is, the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing, ye may have life in his name.  

## John 21

1. After these things, Jesus manifested himself again, unto the disciples, by the sea of Tiberias; and manifested himself, thus:—

2. There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas, who was called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and, two other, of his disciples.

3. Simon Peter saith unto them—I go a fishing! They say unto him—We also, go with thee! They went out, and got up into the boat, and during that night, they caught nothing.

4. But, morning by this time drawing on, Jesus stood upon the beach; nevertheless, the disciples knew not that it was, Jesus.

5. Jesus, therefore, saith unto them—Children! perhaps ye have nothing to eat? They answered him—No.

6. And, he, said unto them—Cast the net, on the right side of the boat,—and ye shall find. They cast, therefore; and, no longer, were they able, to draw, it, for the multitude of the fishes.

7. That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus loved, saith unto Peter—It is, the Lord! Simon Peter, therefore, hearing that it was the Lord, girded about him, his upper garment,—for he was naked; and cast himself into the sea;

8. but, the other disciples, came, by the little boat,—for they were not farther from the land than about two hundred cubits off,—dragging the net of fishes.

9. So, when they got out upon the land, they behold a coal fire lying, and fish lying over, and bread.

10. Jesus saith unto them—Bring of the fish which ye caught just now.

11. Simon Peter, therefore, went on board, and drew the net on to the land,—full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and, though they were so many, the net was not rent.

12. Jesus saith unto them—Come! break your fast. Not one, of the disciples was venturing to ask him, Who art, thou? knowing that it was, the Lord.

13. Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth unto them; and the fish, in like manner.

14. This, already, is the third time Jesus was manifested unto the disciples, after he was raised from among the dead. 

15.  When, therefore, they had broken their fast, Jesus saith unto Simon Peter—Simon, son of John! lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him—Yea, Lord! thou, knowest that I am fond of thee, he saith unto him—Be feeding my lambs.

16. He saith unto him, again, the second time—Simon, son of John! lovest thou me? He saith unto him—Yea, Lord! thou, knowest that I am fond of thee. He saith unto him—Be shepherding my sheep.

17. He saith unto him, the third time—Simon, son of John! art thou fond of me? Peter was grieved, that he said unto him, the third time, Art thou fond of me? and he said unto him—Lord! all things, thou, knowest: thou perceivest that I am fond of thee. Jesus saith unto him—Be feeding my sheep.

18. Verily, verily, I say unto thee—When thou wast younger, thou usedst to gird thyself, and to walk whither thou didst choose; but, when thou shalt become aged, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and, another, shall gird thee, and bear thee, whither thou dost not choose.

19. Now, this, he said, signifying, by what manner of death, he should glorify God. And, having said this, he saith unto him—Be following me. 

20.  Peter, turning about, beholdeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following,—who also reclined during the supper upon his breast, and said—Lord, who is it that is delivering thee up?

21. Peter, therefore, seeing, this one, saith unto Jesus—Lord! and, this one, what?

22. Jesus saith unto him—If I will that, he, remain until I come, what is that to thee? Thou, be following me.

23. This word, therefore, went forth unto the brethren, that, that disciple, should not die. Howbeit, Jesus did not tell him, he should not die; but, If I will that, he, remain until I come, what is that to thee?

24. This, is the disciple who beareth witness concerning these things, and who hath written these things; and we know that, true, is, his witness.

25. Now there are many other things also, which Jesus did, which, indeed, if they were to be written one by one, not even the world, itself, I suppose, would contain, the books which must be written.
