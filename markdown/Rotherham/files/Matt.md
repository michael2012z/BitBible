## Matthew 1

1. The Lineage Roll of Jesus Christ,—Son of David, Son of Abraham.

2. Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob, begat Judah and his brethren;

3. And Judah begat Perez and Zarah of Tamah, and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram;

4. And Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nashon, and Nashon begat Salmon;

5. And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse;

6. And Jesse begat David the King. And David begat Solomon of her [that had been the wife] of Uriah;

7. And Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa;

8. And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah;

9. And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah:

10. And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah;

11. And Josiah begat Jechoniah, and his brethren,—upon the removal to Babylon.

12. And, after the removal to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;

13. And Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor;

14. And Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud;

15. And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob;—

16. And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,—who is called Christ.

17. So then, all the generations from Abraham unto David, are, fourteen, generations, and, from David unto the removal to Babylon, fourteen, generations; and, from the removal to Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen, generations. 

18.  Now the birth, of [Jesus] Christ, was, thus: His mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph,—before they came together, she was found with child by [the] Holy Spirit.

19. Moreover, Joseph her husband, being, righteous, and yet unwilling to expose her,—intended, privately, to divorce her.

20. But, when, these things, he had pondered, lo! a messenger of the Lord, by dream, appeared to him, saying,—Joseph, son of David! do not fear to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for, that which, in her, hath been begotten, is of [the], Holy, Spirit.

21. Moreover she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus,—for, he, will save his people from their sins.

22. But, all this, hath come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord, through the prophet, saying:

23. Lo! a Virgin, shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,—and they shall call his name Emmanuel; which is, being translated, God with us.

24. And Joseph, awaking, from his sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him,—and took unto him his wife;

25. and knew her not, until she had brought forth a son,—and he called his name Jesus.  

## Matthew 2

1. Now, when, Jesus, was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, lo! wise men from eastern parts, came into Jerusalem:

2. saying—Where is he that hath been born king of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and have come to bow down to him.

3. But, when King Herod heard, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;

4. and, assembling all the high-priests and scribes of the people, he was enquiring of them—Where is, the Christ, to be born?

5. And, they, said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea,—for, so, is it written through the prophet:

6. And, thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means least, art thou, among the governors of Judah,—For, out of thee, shall one come forth to govern, Who shall shepherd my people Israel.

7. Then Herod, privately, calling the wise men, ascertained from them the time of the appearing star;

8. and sending them to Bethlehem, said—Go search out accurately concerning the child,—and, as soon as ye find it, bring report unto me, that, I also, may come and bow myself down to it. 

9.  Now, they, hearing the king, went, and lo! the star which they had seen in the east, was going before them, until it went and stood over where the child was;

10. and, seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy;

11. and, coming into the house, they saw the child, with Mary its mother,—and, falling down, prostrated themselves unto it, and, opening their treasures, offered unto it gifts—gold and frankincense and myrrh;

12. and, being instructed by dream, not to return unto Herod, by another way, retired they unto their own country. 

13.  Now, when they had retired, lo! a messenger of the Lord, appeareth by dream unto Joseph, saying, Arise, take unto thee the child and its mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there, until I tell thee,—for Herod is about to seek the child, to destroy it.

14. And, he, arising, took unto him the child and its mother, by night, and retired into Egypt;

15. and was there, until the death of Herod,—that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt, called I my son. 

16.  Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly enraged,—and sent and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its bounds, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.

17. Then was fulfilled, that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

18. A voice, in Ramah, was heard, weeping and great mourning,—Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted,—because they are not. 

19.  But, when Herod was, dead, lo! a messenger of the Lord, appeareth by dream unto Joseph in Egypt;

20. saying—Arise! and take unto thee the child and its mother, and be journeying into the land of Israel,—for they are dead, who were seeking the life of the child.

21. And, he, arising, took unto him the child and its mother, and entered into the land of Israel.

22. Hearing, however, that, Archelaus, was reigning over Judaea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid, thither, to go,—and so, being instructed by dream, he retired into the parts of Galilee;

23. and came and fixed his dwelling in a city called Nazareth,—that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets—A Nazarene, shall he be called.  

## Matthew 3

1. Now, in those days, came John the Immerser, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judaea;

2. saying, Repent ye,—for the kingdom of the heavens hath drawn near.

3. For, this, is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, A voice, of one crying aloud! In the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight, be making his paths.

4. But John, himself, had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins,—while, his food, was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then, were going forth unto him—Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round about the Jordan:

6. and were being immersed in the Jordan river, by him, openly confessing their sins. 

7.  But, seeing, many of the Pharisees and Sadducees, coming unto his immersion, he said to them,—Broods of vipers! who suggested to you, to be fleeing from the coming wrath?

8. Bring forth, therefore, fruit worthy of repentance;

9. and think not to be saying within yourselves,—As our father, we have, Abraham; for, I say unto you, that God is able, out of these stones, to raise up children unto Abraham.

10. Already also, the axe, unto the root of the trees, is being laid,—every tree, therefore, not bringing forth good fruit, is to be hewn down, and, into fire, to be cast.

11. I, indeed, am immersing you, in water, unto repentance,—but, he who, after me, cometh is, mightier than I, whose, sandals, I am not worthy to bear, he, will immerse you, in Holy Spirit and fire:

12. Whose fan is in his hand, and he will clear out his threshing-floor,—and will gather his wheat into the granary, but, the chaff, will he burn up with fire unquenchable. 

13.  Then, cometh Jesus, from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John,—to be immersed by him.

14. But, he, would have hindered him, saying—I, have, need, by thee, to be immersed,—and dost, thou, come unto me?

15. But Jesus answering, said unto him, Suffer [me] even now,—for, thus, it becometh us, to fulfil, all righteousness; then, he suffered him.

16. And Jesus, having been immersed, straightway, went up from the water,—and lo! the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God, descending like a dove coming upon him;

17. and lo! a voice out of the heavens,—saying, This, is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight.  

## Matthew 4

1. Then, Jesus was led up into the wilderness, by the Spirit, to be tempted by the adversary;

2. and, fasting forty days and forty nights,—afterwards, he hungered.

3. And, coming near, the tempter said to him,—If thou art God’s, Son, speak! that, these stones, may become, loaves.

4. But, he, answering, said, It is written,—Not on bread alone, shall man live, but on every declaration coming forth through the mouth of God.

5. Then, the adversary taketh him with him, unto the holy city,—and he set him upon the pinnacle of the temple;

6. and saith to him—If thou art God’s, Son, cast thyself down,—for it is written, To his messengers, will he give charge concerning thee; and, on hands, will they bear thee up, lest once thou strike, against a stone, thy foot.

7. Jesus said to him, Again, it is written,—Thou shalt not put to the test, the Lord thy God.

8. Again, the adversary taketh him with him, into an exceeding high mountain,—and pointeth out to him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;

9. and said to him, All these things, will I give thee,—if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

10. Then saith Jesus unto him, Withdraw, Satan! for it is written,—The Lord thy God, shalt thou worship, and, to him alone, render divine service.

11. Then, the adversary leaveth him,—and lo! messengers came near, and began ministering unto him. 

12.  And, hearing that, John, had been delivered up, he retired into Galilee;

13. and, forsaking Nazareth, he came and fixed his dwelling in Capernaum, which was by the lake,—within the bounds of Zebulun and Naphtali:

14. that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:

15. Land of Zebulun, and land of Naphtali, the lake-way across the Jordan,—Galilee of the nations,

16. The people that was sitting in darkness, a great light, beheld,—and, on them who were sitting in land and shade of death, Light rose on them.

17. From that time, began Jesus to be making proclamation, and saying,—Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens hath drawn near. 

18.  And, walking round beside the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren—Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother,—casting a large fishing-net into the sea, for they were fishers;

19. and he saith unto them, Come after me,—and I will make you fishers, of men.

20. And, they, straightway, leaving the nets, followed him.

21. And, going forward from thence, he saw other two brethren—James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother—in the boat with Zebedee their father, putting in order their nets,—and he called them.

22. And, they, straightway, leaving the boat and their father, followed him. 

23.  And Jesus was going round throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad-message of the kingdom,—and curing every disease, and every infirmity, among the people.

24. And forth went the report of him into all Syria; and they brought unto him all who were sick, with divers diseases and tortures, distressed, demonized and lunatic and paralyzed,—and he cured them.

25. And there followed him large multitudes—from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and across the Jordan.  

## Matthew 5

1. But, seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain,—and, when he had taken a seat, his disciples came unto him;

2. and, opening his mouth, he began teaching them, saying:— 

3.  Happy, the destitute, in spirit; for, theirs, is the kingdom of the heavens;

4. Happy, they who mourn; for, they, shall be comforted:

5. Happy, the meek; for, they, shall inherit the earth:

6. Happy, they who hunger and thirst for righteousness; for, they, shall be filled:

7. Happy, the merciful; for, they, shall receive mercy:

8. Happy, the pure, in heart; for, they, shall, see God:

9. Happy, the peacemakers; for, they, shall be, called sons of God:

10. Happy, they who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake; for, theirs, is the kingdom of the heavens.

11. Happy, are ye, whensoever they may reproach you and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, falsely, for my sake:

12. Rejoice and exult, because, your reward, is great in the heavens; for, so, persecuted they the prophets who were before you. 

13.  Ye, are the salt of the earth; but, if the salt become tasteless, wherewith shall it be salted? it is good, for nothing, any more, save, being cast out, to be trampled on by men.

14. Ye, are the light of the world: it is impossible for a city to be hid, on the top of a mountain, lying.

15. Neither light they a lamp, and place it under the measure; but upon the lampstand, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.

16. In like manner, let your light shine before men,—that they may see your good works,—and glorify your Father who is in the heavens. 

17.  Do not think, that I came to pull down the law, or the prophets,—I came not to pull down, but to fulfil.

18. For, verily, I say unto you, until the heaven and the earth shall pass away, one least letter, or one point, may in nowise pass away from the law, till all be accomplished.

19. Whosoever, therefore, shall relax one of these commandments, the least, and teach men so, shall be called, least, in the kingdom of the heavens; but, whosoever shall do and teach, the same, shall be called, great, in the kingdom of the heavens.

20. For I say unto you, that, unless your righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees, in nowise, may ye enter into the kingdom of the heavens. 

21.  Ye have heard, that it was said, to them of olden time,—Thou shalt not commit murder, and, whosoever shall commit murder, shall be, liable, to judgment.

22. But, I, say unto you, that, every one who is angry with his brother, shall be, liable, to judgment,—and, whosoever shall say to his brother, Worthless one!, shall be, liable, to the high council; and, whosoever shall say, Rebel!, shall be, liable, unto the fiery gehenna.

23. If, therefore, thou be bearing thy gift towards the altar, and, there, shouldst remember that, thy brother, hath aught against thee,

24. leave, there, thy gift before the altar, and withdraw,—first, be reconciled unto thy brother, and, then, coming, be offering thy gift.

25. Be making agreement with thine adversary, quickly, while thou art with him, in the way,—lest once thine adversary deliver thee up unto the judge, and the judge, unto the officer, and, into prison, thou be cast.

26. Verily, I say unto thee, In nowise, mayest thou come out from thence, until thou pay the last halfpenny. 

27.  Ye have heard, that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:

28. But, I, say unto you, that, Every one who looketh on a woman so as to covet her, already, hath committed adultery with her, in his heart.

29. And, if, thy right eye, is causing thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee,—for it profiteth thee, that, one of thy members, should perish, and not, thy whole body, be cast into gehenna.

30. And, if, thy right hand, is causing thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee,—for it profiteth thee, that, one of thy members, should perish, and not, thy whole body, into gehenna, depart.

31. It was said, moreover, Whosoever shall divorce his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement;

32. But, I, say unto you, that, Everyone who divorceth his wife—saving for unfaithfulness, causeth her to be made an adulteress,—[and, whosoever shall marry a divorced woman, committeth adultery]. 

33.  Again, ye have heard that it was said, to them of olden time, Thou shalt not swear falsely,—but shalt render unto the Lord, thine oaths.

34. But, I, tell you—not to swear, at all: Neither by heaven, because it is the, throne of God,—

35. Nor by the earth, because it is his, footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because, it is the, city, of the Great King;

36. Nor, by thine own head, mayest thou swear, because thou art not able to make, one hair, white or black.

37. But let your word be, Yea, yea,—Nay, nay; and, what goeth beyond these, is, of evil. 

38.  Ye have heard, that it was said,—Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.

39. But, I, tell you, not to resist evil,—Nay, whoever is smiting thee on the right cheek, turn to him, the other also;

40. And, him who is desiring thee to be judged, and to take, thy tunic, let him have, thy mantle also.

41. And, whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two:

42. To him who is asking thee, give; and, him who is desiring from thee to borrow, do not thou turn away. 

43.  Ye have heard, that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

44. But, I, say unto you, Be loving your enemies, and praying for them who are persecuting you:

45. That ye may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens: because, his sun, he maketh arise on evil and good, and sendeth rain, on just and unjust.

46. For, if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? are not, even the tax-collectors, the same thing, doing?

47. And, if ye salute your brethren only, what, more than common, are ye doing? are not, even the nations, the same thing, doing?

48. Ye, therefore, shall become, perfect: as, your heavenly Father, is perfect.  

## Matthew 6

1. [But] take heed, that ye do not, your righteousness, before men, to be gazed at by them,—otherwise at least, reward, have ye none, with your Father who is in the heavens.

2. When, therefore, thou mayest be doing an alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, just as, the hypocrites, do in the synagogues and in the streets—that they may be glorified by men,—Verily, I say unto you, they are getting back their reward.

3. But, thou, when doing an alms, let not, thy left hand, know what thy right hand is doing;

4. that thine alms may be in secret,—and, thy Father, who seeth in secret, will give it back to thee. 

5.  And, when ye may be praying, ye shall not be as the hypocrites, because they love, in the synagogues, and at the corners of the broad ways, to take their stand and pray, that they may shine before men; Verily, I say unto you, they are getting back their reward.

6. But, thou, when thou wouldest pray, enter into thy closet, and, fastening thy door, pray unto thy Father who is in secret,—and, thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee.

7. And, being at prayer, use not vain repetitions, just like the nations,—for they think, that, in their much speaking, they shall be hoard;

8. do not, therefore, make yourselves like them, for [God] your Father knoweth of what things ye have, need, before ye ask him. 

9.  Thus, therefore pray, ye: Our Father, who art in the heavens,—Hallowed be thy name,

10. Come may thy kingdom,—Accomplished be thy will, as in heaven, also on earth:

11. Our needful bread, give us, this day;

12. And forgive us our debts, as, we also, have forgiven our debtors;

13. And bring us not into temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.

14. For, if ye forgive men their faults, Your Father who is in the heavens, will forgive, even you;

15. But, if ye forgive not men [their faults], neither will your Father forgive, your faults. 

16.  And, when ye may he fasting, become not ye, as the hypocrites, of sullen countenance,—for they darken their looks, that they may appear, unto men, to be fasting: Verily, I say unto you, they are getting back their reward.

17. But, when, thou, art fasting, anoint thy head, and, thy face, wash,—

18. that thou do not appear, unto men, to be fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret,—and, thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee. 

19.  Be not laying up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where, moth and rust, do tarnish, and where, thieves, dig through and steal;

20. but be laying up or yourselves treasures in heaven, where, neither moth nor rust, doth tarnish, and where, thieves, dig not through nor steal:

21. for, where, thy treasure, is, there, will be, thy heart [also].

22. The lamp of the body, is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body, shall be, lighted up;

23. But, if thine eye be, evil, thy whole body, shall be, in the dark;—if therefore, the light which is in thee, is, darkness, the darkness, how great!

24. No one, unto two masters, can be in service; for either, the one, he will hate, and, the other ,love, or, one, he will hold to, and, the other, despise: Ye cannot be in service, unto God, and, unto Riches. 

25.  For this cause, I say unto you: Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat [or what ye shall drink],—or for your body, what ye shall put on: Is not, the life, more than, the food? And, the body, than, the raiment?

26. Observe intently, the birds of the heaven,—that they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and yet, your heavenly Father, feedeth, them: Are no, ye, much better than, they?

27. But who from among you, being anxious, can add to his stature one cubit?

28. And, about clothing, why are ye anxious? Consider well the lilies of the field, how they grow,—they toil not neither do they spin;

29. And yet, I say unto you, not even Solomon, in all his glory, was arrayed like, one of these!

30. Now, if the grass of the field—which to-day, is, and, to-morrow, into an oven, is cast—God thus adorneth, not much rather, you, little of faith?

31. Do not then be anxious saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or Wherewithal shall we be arrayed?

32. For, all these things, the nations, seek after,—for your heavenly Father, knoweth, that ye are needing, all these things.

33. But be seeking first, the kingdom and its righteousness,—and, all these things, shall be added unto you.

34. Do not, then, be anxious for the morrow; for the morrow, will be anxious, for itself: Sufficient for the day, is the evil thereof.  

## Matthew 7

1. Judge not, that ye be not judged;—

2. For, with what judgment ye judge, shall ye be judged,—and, with what measure ye mete, shall it be measured unto you.

3. Why, moreover, beholdest thou the mote, in the eye of thy brother,—while, the beam in thine own eye, thou dost not consider?

4. Or how wilt thou say unto thy brother, Let me cast the mote out of thine eye,—when lo! a beam, is in thine own eye?

5. Hypocrite! cast first, out of thine own eye, the beam,—and, then, shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote, out of the eye of thy brother.

6. Do not give what is holy unto dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine,—lest once they trample, them, down with their feet, and, turning, tear, you. 

7.  Be asking, and it shall be given you, Be seeking, and ye shall find,—Be knocking, and it shall be opened unto you.

8. For, whosoever asketh, receiveth, and, he that seeketh, findeth,—and, to him that knocketh, shall it be opened.

9. Or what man, from among yourselves, whom his son shall ask for a loaf,—a stone, will give him?

10. Or, a fish also, shall ask,—a serpent, will give him?

11. If then, ye, being, evil, know how, good gifts, to be giving unto your children, how much more, will, your Father who is in the heavens, give good things to them that ask, him? 

12.  Whatsoever things, therefore, ye would, that men be doing unto you, so, be, ye also, doing, unto them,—for, this, is the law and the prophets.

13. Enter ye in at, the narrow gate; because broad and roomy is the way that leadeth unto destruction,—and, many, are they who enter thereby:

14. Because, narrow, is the gate, and, confined, the way, that leadeth unto life,—and, few, are they who find, it. 

15.  Beware of false prophets, who come unto you in clothing of sheep,—while, within, they are ravening wolves.

16. By their fruits, shall ye find, them, out,—unless perhaps men gather—from thorns, grapes! or, from thistles, figs!

17. So, every good tree, fine fruit, produceth,—whereas, the worthless tree, evil fruit, produceth:

18. It is, impossible, for a, good tree, to be bearing, evil fruit, neither doth, a worthless tree, produce, fine fruit.

19. Every tree that beareth not fine fruit, is hewn down, and, into fire, is cast.

20. After all then, by their fruits, shall ye find, them, out. 

21.  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord! Lord! shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens,—but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in the heavens.

22. Many, will say unto me, in, that, day, Lord! Lord! did we not, in thy name, prophesy, and, in thy name, cast, demons, out,—and, in thy name, many works of power, perform?

23. And, then, will I confess unto them, Never, have I acknowledged you,—Depart from me, ye workers of lawlessness!

24. Every one, therefore, who heareth [these] my words, and doeth them, shall be likened to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock;

25. And the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and rushed against that house, and it fell not; for it had been founded upon the rock.

26. And every one who heareth these my words, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;

27. And the rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and dashed against that house, and it fell; and, the fall thereof, was, great.

28. And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, with astonishment were the multitudes being struck at his teaching;

29. for he was teaching them as one having, authority, and not as their Scribes.  

## Matthew 8

1. And when he came down from the mountain, there followed him large multitudes.

2. And lo! a leper, coming near, began to bow down to him saying,—Lord! if thou be willing, thou canst cleanse me.

3. And, stretching forth the hand, he touched him, saying,—I am willing, be cleansed! And, straightway, cleansed was his leprosy.

4. And Jesus saith unto him, Mind! tell, no one,—but withdraw, thyself, shew to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses directed, for a witness unto them. 

5.  And, when he entered into Capernaum, there came near unto him a centurion, beseeching him,

6. and saying, Lord! my servant, is laid prostrate in the house, a paralytic, fearfully tortured.

7. He saith unto him, I, will come and cure him.

8. But the centurion, answering, said, Lord! I am of no consideration, that, under my roof, thou shouldest enter,—but, only say with a word, and healed shall be my servant.

9. For, I also, am a man [set] under authority, having under myself, soldiers,—and I say to this one, Go! and he goeth, and to another, Come! and he cometh, and, to my servant, Do this! and he doeth it.

10. Now Jesus, hearing, marveled, and said to them that followed,—Verily, I say unto you, With no one in Israel, such faith as this, have I found.

11. But I say unto you, Many from east and west, will have come, and shall recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens;

12. Whereas, the sons of the kingdom, shall be cast forth into the darkness outside,—There, will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

13. And Jesus said unto the centurion, Withdraw! and, as thou hast believed, be it done for thee. And healed was the servant in that hour. 

14.  And Jesus, coming into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law laid prostrate and in a fever,

15. and he touched her hand, and the fever left her,—and she arose, and began ministering unto him.

16. But, when, evening, came, they brought unto him many demonized,—and he cast out the spirits with a word, and, all who were sick, he cured:

17. that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,—Himself, our weaknesses, took, and, diseases, bare. 

18.  Now Jesus, seeing a multitude about him, gave orders to depart unto the other side.

19. And a certain scribe, coming near, said unto him,—Teacher; I will follow thee, whithersoever Thou goest.

20. And Jesus saith unto him: The foxes, have, dens, and, the birds of the heavens, nests,—but, the Son of Man, hath not where, his head he may recline.

21. And, another of the disciples, saith unto him,—Lord! suffer me, first, to depart, and bury my father.

22. But, Jesus, saith unto him,—Be following me, and leave, the dead, to bury, their own dead. 

23.  And, when he, entered, into a boat, his disciples followed him.

24. And lo! a great squall, arose in the sea, so that, the boat, was being covered, by the waves,—but, he, was sleeping.

25. And, coming near, they aroused him, saying, Master! save, we perish!

26. And he saith unto them, Why, are ye, fearful, little of faith? Then, aroused, he rebuked the winds and the sea,—and it became a great calm.

27. But, the men, marveled, saying, Whence is this one,—that, both the winds and the sea, unto him, give ear? 

28.  And, when he, came, unto the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him, two men demonized, out of the tombs, coming forth,—fierce exceedingly, so that no one could pass that way;

29. and lo! they cried aloud, saying, What have we in common with thee, O Son of God? Hast thou come hither, before the right time, to torment us?

30. Now there was, far from them, a herd of many swine, feeding;

31. and, the demons, began to beseech him, saying, If thou dost cast us out, send us away, into the herd of swine.

32. And he said unto them, Withdraw! So, they, going out, departed into the swine,—and lo! all the herd rushed down the cliff, into the sea, and died in the waters.

33. And, they who were feeding them, fled,—and, departing into the city, reported all things, and what concerned them who had been demonized.

34. And lo! all the city, came out to meet Jesus,—and, seeing him, they besought that he would pass on from their bounds.  

## Matthew 9

1. And, entering into a boat, he crossed over, and came into his own city.

2. And lo! they were bringing unto him a paralytic, on a couch, laid prostrate; and Jesus, seeing, their faith, said to the paralytic,—Take courage! child, forgiven are thy sins.

3. And lo! certain of the scribes, said within themselves,—This man, speaketh profanely!

4. And Jesus, knowing, their inward thoughts, said,—To what end are ye cherishing evil thoughts within your hearts?

5. For which is easier—To say, Forgiven are thy sins,—or to say, Rise and be walking!

6. But, that ye may know, that the Son of Man hath, authority, upon the earth, to be forgiving sins, then, saith he to the paralytic,—Rise! take up thy couch, and withdraw unto thy house.

7. And, rising, he departed unto his house.

8. Now the multitudes, seeing, were struck with fear, and glorified the God who had given authority, such as this, unto men. 

9.  And Jesus, passing aside from thence, saw a man presiding over the tax-office, called, Matthew, and saith unto him,—Be following me. And, arising, he followed him.

10. And it came to pass, as he was reclining in the house, that lo! many tax-collectors and sinners, came, and were reclining together with Jesus and his disciples.

11. And, the Pharisees, observing it, began to say unto his disciples,—Wherefore, with tax-collectors and sinners, doth your Teacher eat?

12. And, he, hearing it, said,—No need have the strong, of a physician, but they who are sick.

13. But go ye, and learn what this meaneth,—Mercy, I desire, and not, sacrifice; For I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners. 

14.  Then come near unto him the disciples of John, saying,—Wherefore do, we, and the Pharisees, fast, whereas, thy disciples, fast not?

15. And Jesus said unto them,—Can, the sons of the bridechamber, mourn, so long as, the bridegroom, is, with them? But days will come, when the bridegroom, shall be taken from them, and, then, will they fast.

16. Howbeit, no one, layeth on a patch of unshrunk cloth, upon an old garment,—for the shrinking of it teareth away from the garment, and, a worse rent, is made.

17. Neither pour they new wine into old skins: otherwise at least, the skins are burst, and, the wine, runneth out, and, the skins, are spoiled,—but they pour new wine into unused skins, and, both, are together preserved. 

18.  While, these things, he was speaking unto them, lo! a [certain] ruler, came, and began bowing down to him, saying,—My daughter, just now died! But come, and lay thy hand upon, her, and she shall live.

19. And Jesus, arising, was following him, also his disciples.

20. And lo! a woman, having a flow of blood twelve years, coming near behind, touched the fringe of his mantle.

21. For she kept saying within herself,—If only I touch his mantle, I shall be made well!

22. And, Jesus, turning and seeing her, said,—Take courage! daughter, Thy faith, hath made thee well. And the woman was made well, from that hour.

23. And, Jesus, coming, into the house of the ruler, and seeing the flute-players and the multitude in confusion, was saying:

24. Give place! for the maiden died not, but is sleeping. And they began to deride him.

25. But, when the multitude had been put forth, he went in, and grasped her hand,—and the maiden arose.

26. And forth went this report, into the whole of that land. 

27.  And, as Jesus, was passing aside from thence, there followed him, two blind men, crying aloud and saying,—Have mercy on us, O Son of David!

28. And, when he entered the house, the blind men came unto him,—and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye, that I can, do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord!

29. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it done unto you.

30. And their eyes were opened. And Jesus, sternly charged them, saying, Mind! let no one know!

31. They, however, going forth, made him known throughout the whole of that land.

32. And, as, they, were going forth, lo! there was brought to him, a dumb man, demonized.

33. And, the demon being cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the multitudes marvelled, saying,—Never, was it seen thus, in Israel.

34. [But, the Pharisees, beg to say, In the ruler of the demons, is he casting out the demons.] 

35.  And Jesus was going round all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad-message of the kingdom,—and curing every disease, and every infirmity.

36. But, seeing the multitudes, he was moved with compassion concerning them, because they were torn and thrown down, like sheep hating no shepherd.

37. Then, saith he unto his disciples, The harvest, indeed, is great, but, the labourers, few;

38. Beg ye, therefore, of the Lord of the harvest,—That he would thrust forth labourers, into his harvest.  

## Matthew 10

1. And, calling near his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over impure spirits,—so as to be casting them out, and curing every disease and every infirmity.

2. Now, the twelve apostles’ names, are these:—first Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother,—and James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother;

3. Philip, and Bartholomew,—Thomas, and Matthew, the tax-collector; James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thadaeus;

4. Simon, the zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up. 

5.  These twelve, Jesus sent forth, charging them, saying:—Into any way to the nations, do not depart,—and, into any city of Samaritans, do not enter;

6. But be going, rather, unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And, as ye go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of the heavens hath drawn near!

8. Be curing, the sick, raising, the dead,—cleansing, lepers, casting out, demons: freely, ye have, received, freely, give.

9. Ye may procure—neither gold, nor silver, nor copper, for your belts,—

10. neither satchel for journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff; for, worthy, is the labourer, of his maintenance.

11. And, into whatsoever city or village ye enter, search out who in it is, worthy, and, there, abide, till ye go forth.

12. And, as ye enter the house, salute it;

13. And, if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it, but, if it be not worthy, let your peace, unto you, return.

14. And, whosoever shall neither welcome you, nor hear your words, as ye go forth outside that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet:

15. Verily, I say unto you,—More tolerable, will it be, for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for, that, city! 

16.  Lo! I, send you forth as sheep amidst wolves; become ye therefore—prudent, as serpents, and simple, as doves.

17. But beware of men; for they will deliver you up into high-councils, and, in their synagogues, will they scourge you,—

18. And, before both governor and kings, shall ye be brought, for my sake—for a witness to them and the nations.

19. And, when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak,—for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak;

20. For it is not, ye, who are speaking, but, the Spirit of your Father, that is speaking in you.

21. And, brother, will deliver up, brother, unto death, and, father, child,—and, children, will rise up, against parents, and will put them to death.

22. And ye will be hated by all, because of my name,—but, he that endureth throughout, the same, shall be saved.

23. And, when they persecute you in this city, flee into another,—for, verily, I say unto you, in nowise shall ye finish the cities of Israel, till, he Son of Man, come.

24. A, disciple, is not above, the teacher, nor, a servant, above, his lord:

25. Sufficient for the disciple, that he become, as his teacher, and, the servant, as, his lord. If, the master of the house, Beelzebul, they called, how much more, the men of his house!

26. Then do not fear them,—for, nothing hath been covered, which shall not be, uncovered, and, hidden, which shall not be, made known.

27. What I am saying to you in the darkness, tell ye in the light,—and, what [whispered] into the ear ye are hearing, proclaim ye on the housetops.

28. And be not in fear, by reason of them that are killing the body,—and, the soul, are not able to kill. But fear, rather, him who is able, both soul and body, to destroy in gehenna!

29. Are not, two sparrows, for a farthing, sold? And, one from among them, shall not fall upon the ground, without your Father;

30. But, even the hairs of, your, head, have all been numbered.

31. Then be not in fear—than many sparrows, better are, ye!

32. Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, I also, will confess, him, before my Father who is in the heavens;

33. But, whoever shall deny me before men, I also, will deny, him, before my Father who is in the heavens.

34. Do not think, that I came to thrust peace upon the earth,—I came not to thrust, peace, but, a sword;

35. For I came to set at variance—a man, against, his father, and, a daughter, against, her mother, and, a bride, against, her mother-in-law;

36. And, a man foes, are, they of his own house.

37. He that loveth father or mother above me, is not, worthy, of me,—and, he that loveth son or daughter above me, is not, worthy, of me;

38. And, he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not, worthy, of me.

39. He that hath found his life, shall lose it,—and, he that hath lost his life, for my sake, shall find it.

40. He that giveth welcome unto you, unto me, giveth welcome, and, he that, unto me, giveth welcome, giveth welcome—unto him that sent me forth.

41. He that giveth welcome unto a prophet, in the name of a prophet, the reward of a prophet, shall receive; and, he that giveth welcome unto a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, the reward of a righteous man, shall receive;—

42. And, whosoever shall give to drink—unto one of these little ones—a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, Verily, I say unto you, in nowise, shall lose his reward!  

## Matthew 11

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he passed on from thence, to be teaching and proclaiming in their cities.

2. Now, John, hearing in the prison the works of the Christ, sending through his disciples,

3. said unto him, Art, thou, the coming one? or, a different one, are we to expect?

4. And, answering, Jesus said unto them—Go report unto John what ye do hear and see:—

5. The, blind, recover sight, and, the lame, walk, lepers, are cleansed, and, the deaf, hear,—and, the dead, are raised, and, the destitute, are told the joyful tidings;

6. And, happy, is he, whosoever shall not find cause of stumbling, in me. 

7.  But, as these were going their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes, concerning John,—What went ye forth into the wilderness to gaze at? A reed, by a wind, shaken?

8. But what went ye forth to see? A man, in soft clothing, arrayed? Lo! they who soft clothing do wear, are in the houses of kings.

9. But why went ye forth? A prophet, to see? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.

10. This, is he, concerning whom it is written,—Lo! I, send my messenger before thy face, who shall make ready thy way before thee!

11. Verily, I say unto you—There hath not arisen, among such as are born of women, a greater than John the Immerser,—yet, he that is less in the kingdom of the heavens, is, greater than he.

12. But, from the days of John the Immerser, until even now, the kingdom of the heavens, is being invaded, and, invaders, are, seizing upon it.

13. For, all the prophets and the law, until John, did prophesy;

14. And, if ye are willing to accept it, he, is Elijah—the one destined to come.

15. He that hath ears, let him hear! 

16.  But, unto what, shall I liken this generation? It is, like, unto children, sitting the market-places, who, calling unto the others,

17. say, We played the flute to you, and ye danced not,—we sang a lament, and ye beat not the breast.

18. For, John, came, neither eating nor drinking, and they say—A demon, he hath!

19. The Son of Man, came, eating and drinking, and they say, Lo! a gluttonous man and a wine-drinker! a friend of, tax-collectors, and sinners! And yet wisdom hath been justified by her works.

20. Then, began he to upbraid the cities, in which had been done his noblest mighty works; because they repented not:—

21. Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! Because, if, in Tyre and Zidon, had been done the works of power, which were done in you, of old, in sackcloth and ashes, had they repented.

22. Moreover, I say unto you, For Tyre and Zidon, more tolerable, will it be, in the day of judgment, than for you.

23. And, thou, Capernaum! Unto heaven, shalt thou be uplifted? Unto hades, thou shall be brought down; because, if, in Sodom, had been done the works of power, which were done in thee, it would, in that case, have remained until this day.

24. Moreover, I say unto you—For the land of Sodom, more tolerable, will it be in a day of judgment, than, for thee. 

25.  In that season, answered Jesus, and said—I openly give praise unto thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,—in that thou hast hid these things from the wise and discerning, and hast revealed them unto babes;

26. Yea, O Father! That, so, it hath become, a delight, before thee.

27. All things, unto me, have been delivered up by my Father; and, no one, fully knoweth the Son, save the rather, neither doth any one fully know, the Father, save, the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son, may be minded, to reveal, him.

28. Come unto me! all ye that toil and are burdened, and, I, will give you rest:

29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me,—because, meek, am I and lowly, in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls;

30. For, my yoke, is easy, and, my burden, light.  

## Matthew 12

1. In that season, went Jesus, on, the sabbath, through the cornfields,—and, his disciples, hungered, and began to pluck ears of corn, and to eat.

2. But, the Pharisees, observing it, said unto him, Lo! thy disciples, are doing what is not allowed to do, on sabbath.

3. And he said unto them, have ye never read what, David, did, when he hungered, and they who were with him? how

4. he entered into the house of God and, the presence-bread, did eat, which it was not, allowable, for him to eat, nor for them who were with him,—save for the priests, alone?

5. Or have ye not read, in the law, that, on the sabbaths, the priests, in the temple, the sabbath, profane, and are, blameless?

6. But I say unto you,—Something greater than the Temple, is here!

7. If, however, ye had known what this meaneth—Mercy, I desire, and not, sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the blameless;

8. For, the Son of Man, is, Lord of the Sabbath.

9. And, passing on from thence, he came into their synagogue;

10. and lo! a man having, a withered hand, and they questioned him, saying, Is it allowable, on the sabbath, to heal? that they might accuse him.

11. And said unto them, What man, from among yourselves, [shall there be],—Who shall have one sheep, and, if this should fall, on the sabbath, into a pit, will not lay hold of it, and raise it?

12. How much better, then, a man, than, a sheep? So that it is allowable, on the sabbath, nobly, to act.

13. Then saith he unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand! And he stretched it forth,—and it was restored, whole, as the other. 

14.  And the Pharisees, going forth, took, counsel, against him, to the end that, him, they might destroy.

15. But, Jesus, taking note, retired from thence,—and many followed him, and he cured them all;

16. and straitly charged them, lest they should make him, manifest:

17. that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:—

18. Lo! my servant, whom I have chosen, My beloved, in whom, my soul, delighteth,—I will put my Spirit upon him, and, justice, unto the nations, will he report:

19. He will not strive, nor will he cry out, nor shall any hear, in the broadways, his voice:

20. A bruised cane, will he not break, and, a smoking wick, will he not quench,—until he urge on, justice, to victory,

21. And, in his name, shall nations hope. 

22.  Then they brought unto him, one demonized, blind and dumb,—and he cured him, so that the dumb did speak and see.

23. And all the multitudes were beside themselves, and were saying, Can, this one, be, the Son of David?

24. But, the Pharisees, hearing it, said, This one, doth not cast out the demons, save in Beelzebul ruler of the demons.

25. And, knowing their inward thoughts, he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself, is laid waste,—and, no city or house divided against itself, will stand;

26. And, if, Satan, is casting, Satan, out, against himself, hath he become divided,—How then shall, his kingdom, stand?

27. And, if, I, in Beelzebul, am casting out the demons, In whom are, your sons, casting them out? Wherefore, they, shall be, judges of you.

28. But, if, in God’s Spirit, I, am casting out the demons, then doubtless hath come upon you unawares, the kingdom of God!

29. Or how can one enter the house of the mighty and, seize his goods, unless, first, he bind the mighty one? and, then, his house, he will plunder.

30. He that is no with me, is, against me,—and, he that gathereth not with me, scattereth

31. Wherefore, I say unto you, All sin and profane speaking, shall be forgiven unto men,—but, the speaking profanely of the Spirit, shall not be forgiven;

32. And, whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him,—but, whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age, or the coming.

33. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree worthless, and its fruit worthless; for, from the fruit, the tree is known.

34. Broods of vipers! How can ye speak, good things, being, evil? For, out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.

35. The good man, out of the good treasure, putteth forth, good things; and, the evil man, out of the evil treasure, putteth forth, evil things.

36. But I say unto you, That, every useless expression that men shall utter, they shall render, concerning it, an account, in a day of judgment;

37. For, by thy words, shalt thou be, justified, and, by thy words, shalt thou be condemned. 

38.  Then, answered him, certain of the Scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher! we desire of thee, a sign, to behold.

39. But, he, answering, said unto them, A wicked and adulterous generation, a sign, doth seek, and, a sign, will not be, given, it, save the sign of Jonah the prophet.

40. For, just as was Jonah in the belly of the sea-monster three days and three nights, so, will be the Son of Man, in the heart of the earth, three days and three nights.

41. Men of Nineveh, will rise up in the judgment, with this generation, and will condemn it,—because they repented into the proclamation of Jonah; and lo! something greater than Jonah, here.

42. The queen of the south, will arise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it—because she came out of the ends of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo! something greater than Solomon, here.

43. But, when the impure spirit goeth out of the man, it passeth through waterless places, seeking rest,—and findeth it not.

44. Then, it saith, Into my house, will I return whence I came out,—and, coming, findeth it empty [and] swept and adorned.

45. Then, it goeth, and taketh along with itself, seven diverse spirits, more wicked than itself,—and, entering, abideth there; and, the last state of that man, becometh, worse than the first. So, shall it be, with this, wicked, generation. 

46.  While yet he was speaking unto the multitudes, lo! his mother and brethren, were standing without, seeking to speak with him.

47. [And one said to him, Lo! thy mother and thy brethren, without, are standing, seeking, to speak, with thee.]

48. But, he, answering, said unto him that was telling him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?

49. And, stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said, Lo! my mother and my brethren!

50. For, whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he, is my, brother, and sister, and mother.  

## Matthew 13

1. On that day, Jesus, going out of the house, was sitting near the sea:

2. and there were gathered unto him, large multitudes, so that, he, into a boat, entered, and was sitting, and, all the multitude, on the beach was standing.

3. And he spake unto them many things, in parables, saying: Lo! the sower went forth to sow,—

4. and, as he sowed, some, indeed, fell by the pathway, and, the birds, came, and devoured it;

5. And, some, fell on the rocky places, where it had not much earth,—and, straightway, it sprang up, because if had no depth of earth;

6. and, the sun arising, it was scorched, and, because it had no root, it withered away;

7. And, some, fell upon the thorns, and the thorns came up, and choked it;

8. But, some, fell upon the good ground, and did yield fruit,—this, indeed a hundred fold, and, that, sixty, and, the other, thirty.

9. He that hath ears, let him hear.

10. And the disciples, coming near, said to him, Wherefore, in parables, art thou speaking to them?

11. And, he, answering, said, Because, unto you, hath it been given, to get to know the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens,—whereas, unto them, hath it not been given.

12. For, whosoever hath, it shall be given, to him, and he shall be made to abound,—but, whoever hath not, even what he hath, shall be taken from him?

13. For this reason, in parables, unto them, do I speak,—because, seeing, they see not, and, hearing, they hear not,—neither do they understand.

14. And, again is being fulfilled in them, the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,—They shall, surely hear, and yet will not understand, and, surely see, and yet not perceive;

15. For the heart of this people hath become dense, and, with their ears, heavily have they heard, and, their eyes, have they closed,—lest, once they should see with their eyes, and, with their ears, should hear, and, with their hearts, should understand, and return; when I would certainly heal them.

16. But happy are, your, eyes, that they see, and your ears, that they hear;

17. For, verily, I say unto you—Many prophets and righteous men, have coveted to see what ye see, and have not seen, and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard.

18. Hear, ye, then, the parable of him that sowed:—

19. When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, the wicked one cometh, and catcheth up that which hath been sown in his heart,—this, is he, by the pathway, sown.

20. And, he on the rocky places sown, the same, is he that, heareth the word, and, straightway, with joy, receiveth it;

21. yet hath he no root in himself, but is, only for a season,—and, there arising, tribulation or persecution because of the word, straightway, he findeth cause of stumbling.

22. And, he among the thorns sown, the same, is he that, heareth the word,—and, the anxiety of the age and the deceit of riches, choke up the word, and, unfruitful, it becometh.

23. But, he on the good ground sown, the same, is he who doth hear and understand the word, who, indeed, beareth fruit and produceth,—this, a hundred, and, that, sixty, and, the other, thirty. 

24.  Another parable, put he before them, saying—The kingdom of the heavens hath become like a man sowing good seed in his field;

25. and, while men were sleeping, his enemy came, and sowed over darnel, in among the wheat,—and away he went.

26. And, when the blade shot up, and brought forth, fruit, then, appeared, the darnel also.

27. And the servants of the householder, coming near, said to him,—Sir! was it not, good seed, thou didst sow in thy field? Whence then hath it, darnel?

28. And he said unto them—An enemy, hath, done this. And they say, unto him—Wilt thou, then, that we go and collect it?

29. And, he, saith—Nay! lest, at any time, while collecting the darnel, ye uproot, along with it, the wheat:

30. Suffer both to grow together until the harvest, and at, harvest time, I will say unto the reapers,—Collect ye first, the darnel, and bind it into bundles, with a view to the burning it up; but, the wheat, be gathering it into my barn.

31. Another parable, put he before them, saying—The kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;

32. which, indeed, is, less, than all seeds, but, when grown, is greater than garden-plants, and becometh a tree,—so that the birds of heaven come, and lodge among its branches.

33. Another parable, [spake he unto them]:—The kingdom of the heavens is like, unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until, the whole, was leavened.

34. All these things, spake Jesus in parables, unto the multitudes, and, without a parable, was he speaking, nothing, unto them:

35. that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through the prophet, saying—I will open, in parables, my mouth, I will bring up things hidden from the foundation!

36. Then, dismissing the multitudes, he went into the house, and his disciples came near to him, saying—Make quite plain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.

37. And, he, answering, said—He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of Man;

38. And, the field, is the world, and, the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom,—and, the darnel seeds, are the sons of the evil one;

39. And, the enemy that sowed them, is the adversary, and, the harvest, is, the conclusion of an age, and, the reapers, are, messengers.

40. Just, therefore, as collected is the darnel, and, with fire is burned, so, will it be in the conclusion of the age:—

41. The Son of Man will send forth his messengers, and they will collect, out of his kingdom, all the causes of stumbling, and the doers of lawlessness,

42. and will cast them into the furnace of fire: there, will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

43. Then, the righteous, will shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear! 

44.  The kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a treasure hid in the field, which a man, finding, hid,—and, by reason of his joy, withdraweth and selleth whatsoever he hath, and buyeth that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is, like, unto, a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls,—

46. and, finding one very precious pearl, departing, he at once sold all things, whatsoever he had, and bought it.

47. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a large drag-net, cast into the sea and gathering of every kind,—

48. which, when it was filled, they dragged up on the beach, and, sitting down, collected the good into vessels, but, the worthless, forth they cast.

49. So, will it be in the conclusion of the age: The messengers will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous;

50. and will cast them into the furnace of fire: there, will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

51. Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea!

52. And, he, said unto them—Wherefore, every scribe, discipled unto the kingdom of the heavens, is like unto a householder, who putteth forth out of his treasure, things new and old. 

53.  And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he removed from thence;

54. and, coming into his own city, began teaching them in their synagogue, so that with astonishment were they being struck, and were saying—Whence, hath, this one, this wisdom, and the mighty works?

55. Is not, this one, the carpenter’s, son? Is not, his mother, called Mary, and are not his brethren—James and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?

56. and, his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence, then hath, this one, all these things?

57. And they began to find cause of stumbling in him. But, Jesus, said unto them—A prophet is not without honour, save in his city, and in his house.

58. And he did not, there, many mighty works, because of their unbelief.  

## Matthew 14

1. In that season, heard Herod the tetrarch, the fame of Jesus:

2. and he said unto his servants—This, is John the Immerser,—he hath arisen from the dead, for this cause, are the powers working mightily within him.

3. For, Herod, seizing John, had bound him, and, in prison, put him away,—because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother;

4. for John had been saying to him, It is not allowed thee, to have her.

5. And desiring, to kill, him, he feared the multitude, because, as a prophet, they held him.

6. But, a birthday feast of Herod taking place, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod;

7. wherefore, with an oath, he promised to give her, whatsoever she should ask for herself;

8. and, she, being led on by her mother,—Give me (saith she) here, upon a charger, the head of John the Immerser.

9. And the king, though grieved, yet, because of the oaths and the guests, ordered it to be given;

10. and sent and beheaded John in the prison.

11. And his head was brought upon a charger, and given unto the maiden, and she brought it to her mother.

12. And his disciples, going near, bare away the corpse, and buried him, and came and brought tidings unto Jesus. 

13.  And Jesus, hearing it, retired from thence in a boat, into a desert place, apart,—and the multitudes, hearing of it, followed him on foot from the cities.

14. And, coming forth, he saw a great multitude,—and was moved with compassion over them, and cured their sick.

15. And, evening, arriving, the disciples came unto him, saying—The place is, a desert, and, the hour, hath already passed,—dismiss the multitudes, that they may go away into the villages, and buy themselves food.

16. But, Jesus, said unto them, No need, have they to go away,—give, ye, them to eat.

17. But, they, say unto him—We have nothing here, save five loaves and two fishes.

18. But, he, said—Bring, them, to me, here.

19. And, giving orders that the multitudes should recline upon the grass,—taking the five loaves and the two fishes,—looking up into the heaven, he blessed; and, breaking, gave, the disciples, the loaves, and the disciples unto the multitude.

20. And they did all eat, and were filled,—and they took up the remainder of the broken pieces, twelve baskets, full.

21. And, they who did eat, were about five thousand, men, besides women and children. 

22.  And [straightway] constrained he the disciples to enter into a boat, and be going before him unto the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.

23. And, dismissing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain, apart, to pray,—and when, evening, came, alone, was he, there.

24. Now, the boat, still many furlongs from the land, was holding off, being distressed by the waves,—for, the wind, was, contrary.

25. And, in the fourth watch of the night, he came unto them, walking upon the sea.

26. And, the disciples, seeing him, upon the lake walking, were troubled,—saying—It is, a ghost; and, by reason of their fear, they cried out.

27. And, straightway, Jesus spake unto them, saying—Take courage! it is, I,—be not afraid.

28. And, making answer, Peter said unto him,—Lord! if it is, thou, bid me come unto thee, upon the waters.

29. And, he, said—Come! And, descending from the boat, Peter walked upon the waters, and came unto Jesus.

30. But, seeing the wind, he was affrighted, and, beginning to sink, cried out, saying—Lord! save me!

31. And, straightway, Jesus, stretching forth his hand, laid hold upon him and saith unto him—O little-of-faith! why didst thou doubt?

32. And, when they came up into the boat, the wind abated.

33. And, they in the boat, bowed down to him, saying—Truly, God’s Son, thou art! 

34.  And, going across, they came up the land, into Gennesaret.

35. And, recognizing him, the men of that place, sent out into all that region, and they brought unto him all who were sick;

36. and were beseeching [him], that they might, only, touch the border of his mantle, and, as many as touched, were made quite well.  

## Matthew 15

1. Then, there come unto Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and Scribes, saying—

2. Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands, when they eat bread!

3. But, he, answering, said unto them—Wherefore do, ye also, transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?

4. For, God, said—Honour thy father and thy mother, and—He that revileth father or mother, let him, surely die!

5. But, ye, say—Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother—A gift! Whatsoever, out of me, thou mightest be profited,

6. in nowise, shall honour his father or his mother—and so ye have cancelled, the word of God, for the sake of your, tradition.

7. Hypocrites! well prophesied concerning you, Isaiah, saying—

8. This people, with the lips, do, honour, me, while, their heart, far off, holdeth from me;

9. But, in vain, do they pay devotions unto me, teaching, for teachings, the commandments of men. 

10.  And, calling near the multitude, he said to them—Hear and understand!

11. Not that which entereth into the mouth, defileth the man, but, that which proceedeth out of the mouth, the same, defileth the man,

12. Then, coming near, his disciples say unto him—Knowest thou, that the Pharisees, hearing the word, were caused to stumble?

13. And, he, answering, said—Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, will be uprooted:

14. Let them alone! they are, blind leaders; and, if the, blind, lead the, blind, both, into a ditch, will fall.

15. And Peter, answering, said unto him, Declare to us the parable.

16. And, he, said, To this moment, are, ye also, without discernment?

17. Perceive ye not that, every thing which entereth into the mouth, into the stomach, findeth way, and, into the draught, is passed;

18. while, the things which proceed out of the mouth, out of the heart, come forth, and, they, defile the man.

19. For, out of the heart, come forth wicked designs,—murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, profane speakings:

20. these, are the things which defile the man, but, the eating with unwashed hands, doth not defile the man. 

21.  And, going forth from thence, Jesus retired into the parts of Tyre and Zidon.

22. And lo! a Canaanite woman, from those bounds, coming forth, began crying out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter, is miserably demonized.

23. But, he, answered her no a word. And his disciples, coming forward began requesting him, saying—Dismiss her, because she is crying out after us.

24. But, he, answering, said, I was not sent forth, save unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. And, she, coming, began bowing down to him, saying, Lord! help me.

26. But, he, answering, said, It is, not seemly, to take the loaf of, the children, and cast, to the little dogs.

27. And, she, said, True, Lord! [for], even the little dogs, eat of the crumbs which are falling from the table of, their masters.

28. Then, answering, Jesus said to her—O woman! great, is, thy faith! Be it, done, for thee, as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed, from that hour. 

29.  And, passing on from thence, Jesus came near the sea of Galilee, and, going up into the mountain, was sitting there.

30. And there came unto him large multitudes, having with themselves the lame, the maimed, the blind, the dumb, and many others,—and they cast them near his feet, and he cured them;

31. so that the multitude marvelled, seeing the dumb speaking, the lame walking, and the blind seeing,—and they glorified the God of Israel.

32. But, Jesus, calling near his disciples, said—My compassions are moved towards the multitude, because [even now], three days, abide they with me, and they have nothing to eat,—and, to dismiss them fasting, I am not willing, lest by any means they faint in the way.

33. And his disciples say unto him—Whence, to us, in a wilderness, loaves in such numbers as to fill a multitude, so great?

34. And Jesus saith unto them—How many, loaves have ye? And, they, said,—Seven, and a few small fishes.

35. And, sending word to the multitude to recline upon the ground,

36. he took the seven loaves, and the fishes, and, giving thanks, brake,—and began giving to his disciples, and, the disciples, to the multitudes.

37. And they all did eat and were filled,—and, the remainder of the broken pieces, took they up, seven hampers, full.

38. And, they who did eat, were four thousand men, besides women and children.

39. And, dismissing the multitudes, he went up into the boat,—and came into the bounds of Magadan.  

## Matthew 16

1. And, the Pharisees and Sadducees coming near, putting him to the test, requested him, a sign out of the heaven, to shew unto them.

2. But, he, answering said unto them—[[When evening cometh ye say, Fair! for fiery is the heaven;

3. And at morn, To-day, a storm! for fiery, and yet sad, is the heaven. The face of the heaven indeed, ye learn to distinguish,—but, the signs of the times, ye cannot.]]

4. A wicked and adulterous generation, a sign, doth seek after, and, a sign, will not be given it,—save the sign of Jonah. And, leaving them behind, he departed. 

5.  And the disciples coming, to the other side, had forgotten to take loaves.

6. And, Jesus, said unto them—Mind! and beware, of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

7. And, they, began to deliberate among themselves, saying—Because, loaves, we took not.

8. And, observing it, Jesus said—Why are ye deliberating among yourselves, ye little-of-faith! because, loaves, ye have not?

9. Not yet, perceive ye, neither remember,—The five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye received?

10. Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many hampers ye received?

11. How is it ye perceive not, that, not concerning loaves, spake I unto you,—but beware of the leaven, of the Pharisees and Sadducees?

12. Then, understood they that he did not bid them beware of [the] leaven [of loaves] but of, the teaching, of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 

13.  And, Jesus coming into the parts of Caesarea of Philip, began questioning his disciples, saying—Who are men saying that, the Son of Man, is?

14. And, they, said—Some, indeed, John the Immerser, and, others, Elijah,—but, others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. He saith unto them—But who say, ye, that I am?

16. And, Simon Peter, answering, said—Thou, art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.

17. And Jesus, answering, said to him—Happy, art thou, Simon Bar-yona,—because, flesh and blood, revealed it not unto thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.

18. And, I also, unto thee, say—Thou, art Peter,—and, upon this rock, will I build my assembly, and, the gates of hades, shall not prevail against it.

19. I will give thee, the keys of the kingdom of the heavens,—and, whatsoever thou shalt bind upon the earth, shall be bound in the heavens, and, whatsoever thou shalt loose upon the earth, shall be loosed in the heavens.

20. Then, straitly charged he the disciples, lest, to any man, they should say—He, is, the Christ. 

21.  From that time, began Jesus Christ to be pointing out to his disciples that he must needs, into Jerusalem, go away, and, many things, suffer, from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain,—and on, the third day, arise.

22. And, taking him aside, Peter began to rebuke him, saying—Mercy on thee Lord! In nowise, shall, this, befall thee.

23. But, he, turning, said to Peter—Withdraw behind me, Satan! A snare, art thou of mine, because thou art not regarding the things of God, but the things of men. 

24.  Then, Jesus said unto his disciples—If any one intendeth, after me, to come, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and be following me;

25. For, whosoever intendeth, his life, to save, shall lose it,—but, whosoever shall lose his life, for my sake, shall find it.

26. For what shall a man be profited, though, the whole world, he gain, and, his life, he forfeit? Or what shall a man give, in exchange for his life?

27. For the Son of Man is destined to be coming, in the glory of his Father, with his messengers,—and, then, will he give back unto each one, according to his practice.

28. Verily, I say unto you—There are some of those, here standing, who, indeed, shall in nowise taste of death, until they see the Son of Man, coming in his kingdom.  

## Matthew 17

1. And, after six days, Jesus taketh with him, Peter and James and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain, apart;

2. and was transformed before them,—and his face shone as the sun, and, his garments, became white as the light.

3. And lo! there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, conversing with him.

4. And Peter, answering, said unto Jesus—Lord! it is, delightful, for us, to be here,—If thou wilt, I will make here three tents, for thee, one, and, for Moses, one, and, for Elijah, one.

5. While yet he was speaking, lo! a brightly shining cloud, overshadowed them, and lo! a voice, out of the cloud, saying—This, is, my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight,—Be hearkening to him.

6. And, hearing it, the disciples fell upon their face, and were caused to fear exceedingly.

7. And Jesus came near, and, touching them, said—Arise! and be not afraid.

8. And, lifting up their eyes, no one, saw they, save Jesus, himself, alone.

9. And, as they were coming down out of the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying—Unto no one, may ye tell the vision, until the Son of Man, from among the dead shall arise.

10. And the disciples questioned him, saying—Why then do, the Scribes, say, that, Elijah, must needs come, first?

11. And, he, answering, said—Elijah, indeed, cometh, and will restored all things;

12. But, I say unto you—that, Elijah, just now, came,—and they recognised him not, but did with him, whatsoever they pleased: Thus, the Son of Man also, is destined to suffer by them.

13. Then, perceived the disciples, that, concerning John the Immerser, he spake to them. 

14.  And, when they came unto the multitude, there approached him a man, falling on his knees to him,

15. and saying—Lord! have mercy upon my son,—because he is lunatic, and in a grievous condition; For, many times, falleth he into the fire, and, many times, into the water.

16. And I brought him unto thy disciples, and they could not cure, him.

17. And Jesus, answering, said—O faithless and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me, here.

18. And Jesus rebuked it; and the demon came out of him,—and cured was the boy, from that hour.

19. Then, the disciples, coming near, to Jesus, privately, said—Wherefore could, we, not cast it out?

20. And, he, saith unto them—Because of your little faith. For, verily, I say unto you—If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, remove hence yonder; and it shall be removed, and, nothing, shall be impossible to you.

21.  And, as they were being gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said unto them—The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men;

22. And they will slay him, and, on the third day, will he, arise. And they were grieved exceedingly. 

23.  And, when they came into Capernaum, they who, the half shekel, were receiving, came near unto Peter, and said, Your teacher, doth he not pay the half shekel?

24. He saith—Yea. And, coming into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, How, to thee, doth it seem, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom receive they dues or tax? from their sons, or from the aliens?

25. And, when he said, From the aliens, Jesus said unto him, Well then, free, are the sons!

26. But, that we may not cause them to stumble, go unto the sea, and cast in a hook, and, the first fish that cometh up, take, and, opening its mouth, thou shalt find a shekel,—that, take, and give to them for me and thee.  

## Matthew 18

1. In that hour came, the disciples unto Jesus, saying—Who then is, greatest, in the kingdom of the heavens?

2. And, calling near a child, he set it in the midst of them,

3. and said—Verily, I say unto you, Except ye turn and become as the children, in nowise, shall ye enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

4. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this child, the same, is the greatest, in the kingdom of the heavens;

5. And, whosoever shall give welcome unto one such child as this, upon my name, unto me, giveth welcome.

6. And, whosoever shall cause to stumble one of these little ones who believe in me, it profiteth him, that there be hung a large mill-stone about his neck, and he be sunk in the wide main of the sea. 

7.  Alas for the world! by reason of the causes of stumbling; for it is, necessary, that the causes of stumbling come,—nevertheless, alas for the man through whom the cause of stumbling cometh!

8. But, if, thy hand or thy foot, be causing thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: It is, seemly for thee, to enter into life, maimed or lame, rather than, having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the age-abiding fire.

9. And, if, thine eye, causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: It is, seemly, for thee, one-eyed, into life, to enter, rather than, having two eyes, to be cast into the fiery gehenna.

10. Beware! do not despise one of these little ones; For I say unto you—that, their messengers in the heavens, do, continually, behold the face of my Father in the heavens.

11. How, to you, doth it seem? If a certain man come to have a hundred sheep and one from among them go astray, Will he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains, and going, seek the straying one?

12. And, if it should be that he find it, Verily, I say unto you—He rejoiceth over it, more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.

13. Thus, there is no desire, in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens, that, one of these little ones, should be lost. 

14.  But, if thy brother sin, withdraw, convince him, betwixt thee and him, alone,—If unto thee he hearken, thou hast gained thy brother;

15. But, if he do not hearken, take with thee, yet one or two, that, at the mouth of two witnesses or three, every declaration, maybe established;

16. But, if he hear them amiss, tell it to the assembly,—And, if, even the assembly, he hear amiss, Let him be unto thee, just as the man of the nations and the tax-collector.

17. Verily, I say unto you—Whatsoever things ye shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and, whatsoever things ye shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

18. Again, [verily] I say unto you—If two from among you shall agree upon the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be brought to pass for them, from my Father who is in the heavens;

19. For, where there are two or three, gathered together into my name, there, am I, in their midst. 

20.  Then, coming near, Peter said [to him]—Lord! how many times, shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until, seven, times?

21. Jesus saith to him—I say not unto thee, unto, seven, times, but, until seventy times seven.

22. For this cause, hath the kingdom of the heavens become like unto a man, a king, who wished to settle an account with his servants;

23. And, when he, began, to settle, there was brought unto him a, certain, debtor, of a thousand talents;

24. and, he, not having, wherewith to pay, the master ordered him to be sold, and the wife, and the children, and whatsoever he had,—and payment to be made.

25. The servant therefore, falling down, began to do homage unto him, saying—Have patience with me, and, all, will I pay thee.

26. And, moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him, and, the loan, he, forgave, him.

27. But that servant, going out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him, a hundred denaries, and, laying hold of him, he began seizing him by the throat, saying, Pay! if anything thou owest.

28. His fellow servant, therefore, falling down, began beseeching him, saying, Have patience with me! And I will pay thee.

29. He, however, would not, but went away and cast him into prison,—until he should pay what was owing.

30. His fellow-servants, therefore, seeing, the things that were done, were grieved exceedingly,—and went and made quite plain to their master all the things which had been done.

31. Then, calling him near, his master saith unto him—O wicked servant! All that debt, forgave I thee, because thou didst beseech me.

32. Was it not binding, upon thee also, to have mercy upon thy fellow-servant, as, I also, on thee, had mercy?

33. And, provoked to anger, his master delivered him up to the torturers, until he should pay all that was owing.

34. Thus, my heavenly Father also, will do unto you, if ye forgive not each one his brother, from your hearts.  

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, he removed from Galilee and came into the bounds of Judaea beyond the Jordan.

2. And there followed him large multitudes, and he cured them there. 

3.  And there came unto him Pharisees, testing him, and saying,—Whether is it allowed a man to divorce his wife, for every cause?

4. And, he, answering, said—Did ye never read—He who created at the beginning, Male and female, made them,—

5. and said—For this cause, will a man leave his father and his mother, and be united to his wife,—and, the two, will become, one flesh;

6. So that, the longer, are they, two, but, one flesh, What, therefore, God, hath yoked together, Let not, a man, put asunder.

7. They say unto him—Why then did, Moses, command, to give a writing of repudiation and to divorce?

8. He saith unto them—Moses, in view of your hardness of heart, permitted you to divorce your wives; From the beginning however, hath it not been done, thus.

9. And I say unto you—Whosoever shall divorce his wife, saving for unfaithfulness, and shall marry another, committeth adultery.

10. The disciples say unto him—If, so, is the cause of the husband with the wife, it is not expedient to marry.

11. But, he, said unto them—Not all, find room for he word, save they to whom it hath been given;

12. For there, are, eunuchs, who, from their mother’s womb, were born so, and there, are, eunuchs, who were made eunuchs, by men,—and there, are, eunuchs, who have made, themselves, eunuchs, for the sake the kingdom of the heavens: He that is able to find room, let him find room. 

13.  Then, were brought unto him children,—that he might lay his hands upon them, and pray. And, the disciples, rebuked them.

14. But, Jesus, said—Suffer the children—and do not hinder them—to come unto me,—for, of such, is the kingdom of the heavens.

15. And, laying his hands upon them, he went his way from thence. 

16.  And lo! one coming near unto him, said, Teacher! what good thing shall I do, that I may have life age-abiding?

17. And, he, said unto him—Why dost thou question me concerning that which is good? There is, One, that is good! But, if thou desirest, into life, to enter, be keeping the commandments.

18. He saith unto him, Which? Jesus, said—These: Thou shalt not commit murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal,—Thou shalt not bear false witness;

19. Honour thy father and thy mother,—and—Thou shalt love thy neighbour as, thyself.

20. The young man saith unto him—These all, have I kept,—What, further, do I lack?

21. Jesus said unto him—If thou desirest to be perfect, Withdraw! sell thy substance, and give to the destitute,—and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens; and come! be following me.

22. And the young man, hearing, this word, went away sorrowing,—for he was holding large possessions. 

23.  And, Jesus, said unto his disciples—Verily, I say unto you, A rich man, with difficulty, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

24. Again I say unto you—Easier, is it for, a camel, through the eye of a needle, to enter, than a rich man—into the kingdom of God.

25. And, hearing it, the disciples were being struck with the greatest astonishment, saying—Who then can be saved?

26. And, looking intently, Jesus said unto them—With men, this is, impossible, but, with God, all things are possible.

27. Then, making answer, Peter said unto him—Lo! we, have left all, and followed thee,—What then shall there be, for us?

28. And, Jesus, said unto them—Verily, I say unto you, As for you who followed me in the regeneration, When the Son of Man shall take his seat on his throne of glory, ye also, shall be seated upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And, whosoever left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for sake of my name, manifold, shall receive, and life, age-abiding, shall inherit.

30. But many shall be—first-last, and last-first.  

## Matthew 20

1. For the kingdom of the heavens, is like, a man, a householder,—who went forth with the morning, to hire labourers into his vineyard;

2. and, when he had agreed with the labourers for a denary the day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. And, going forth about the third hour, he saw others, standing in the market-place, unemployed;

4. and, to them, he said—ye also, go your way into the vineyard, and, whatsoever may be right, I will give you;

5. and, they, departed. And, again, going forth about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.

6. And, about the eleventh, going forth, he found others, standing, and saith unto them—Why, here, stand ye, all the day, unemployed?

7. They say unto him—Because, no one, hath hired, us. He saith unto them—Ye also, go your way into the vineyard.

8. And, when evening came, the master of the vineyard saith unto his steward—Call the labourers, and pay the hire,—beginning from the last, unto the first.

9. And they of the eleventh hour, coming, received severally a denary.

10. And, when the first came, they supposed that, more, they should receive,—and, they also, received severally a denary.

11. And, having received it, they began to murmur against the householder, saying—

12. These last, one hour, wrought, and thou hast made them, equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day, and the scorching heat.

13. And, he, answering, unto one of them, said,—Friend! I wrong thee not: Was it not, for a denary, thou didst agree with me?

14. Take thine own, and go thy way; but I please, unto this last, to give, as also to thee:

15. Is it not allowed me to do, what I please, with my own? or is, thine eye, evil, because I good?

16. Thus, shall be—The last first, and the first last. 

17.  And, Jesus, being about to go up unto Jerusalem, took unto him the twelve [disciples], apart, and, in the way, he said unto them—

18. Lo! we are going up unto Jerusalem; and, the Son of Man, will be delivered up unto the chief-priests and Scribes, and they will condemn him, [to death],

19. And deliver him up unto the nations, to mock and to scourge and to crucify,—and, on the third day, he will, arise. 

20.  Then came unto him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down, and asking something from him.

21. And, he, said to her—What desirest thou? She saith unto him—Bid, that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.

22. But Jesus, answering, said—Ye know not what ye are asking: Are ye able to drink the cup, which, I, am about to drink; They say unto him—We are able.

23. He saith unto them—My cup, indeed, ye shall drink; but, to sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give,—except unto those for whom it hath been prepared by my Father.

24. And the ten, hearing, were sorely displeased, concerning the two brethren.

25. But, Jesus, calling them near, said—Ye know that, the rulers of the nations, lord it over them, and, the great ones, wield authority over them:

26. Not so, is it, among you,—but, whosoever shall desire, among you, to become, great, shall be, your minister;

27. And, whosoever shall desire, among you, to be first, shall be, your servant:—

28. Just as, the Son of Man, came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom instead of many. 

29.  And, as they were going forth from Jericho, there followed him a great multitude;

30. and lo! two blind men, sitting beside the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried aloud saying—Lord! have mercy on us! Son of David!

31. But the multitude rebuked them, that they might hold their peace. But, they, the more, cried aloud, saying—Lord, have mercy on us! Son of David!

32. And, standing still, Jesus called them, and said—What desire ye I should do for you?

33. They say unto him—Lord! that, our eyes, may open.

34. And, moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes,—and, straightway, they recovered sight, and followed him.  

## Matthew 21

1. And, when they drew near unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the Mount of Olives, then, Jesus sent forth two disciples;

2. saying unto them—Be going into the village that is over against you, and, straightway, ye shall find an ass, bound, and a colt with her,—loose them, and lead them unto me.

3. And, if anyone, unto you, say aught, ye shall say—Their Lord, hath, need,—and, straightway, he will send them.

4. But, this, hath come to pass, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through the prophet, saying:

5. Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Lo! thy King, is coming unto thee, meek and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of a toiling ass.

6. And the disciples, went, and did as Jesus directed them;

7. and led the ass and the colt, and laid upon them their garments, and he took his seat upon them.

8. And, the chief multitude, spread their own mantles in the way, and, others, were cutting off young branches from the trees, and spreading them in the way;

9. and the multitudes, they who were going before him and they who were following after, were crying aloud, saying—Hosanna! to the Son of David, Blessed is he that is coming in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.

10. And, when he entered into Jerusalem, all the city was startled, saying—Who is this?

11. And, the multitudes, were saying—This, is the prophet Jesus,—He from Nazareth of Galilee. 

12.  And Jesus entered into the temple, and cast out all who were selling and buying in the temple,—and, the tables of the money-changers, he overthrew, and the seats of them who were selling doves;

13. and saith unto them—It is written, My house, a house of prayer, shall be called; but, ye, are making it, A den of robbers!

14. And there came unto him blind and lame, in the temple, and he cured them.

15. But the Chief-priests and the Scribes, seeing, the marvels that he wrought, and the boys who were crying aloud in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! were greatly displeased;

16. and said unto him—Hearest thou what these are saying? And, Jesus, saith unto them—Yea: Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, hast thou prepared praise?

17. And, leaving them behind, he went forth outside the city into Bethany, and spent the night there. 

18.  And, early, returning into the city, he hungered;

19. and, seeing one fig-tree by the way, he came up to it, and nothing, found he thereon, save leaves only,—and he saith unto it—No more, from thee, let fruit spring forth, unto times age-abiding,—and the fig-tree, instantly withered away.

20. And the disciples, seeing it, marvelled, saying—How instantly, did the fig-tree wither away.

21. And Jesus, answering, said unto them—Verily, I say unto you, If ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only, this of the fig-tree, shall ye do,—but, even if, unto this mountain, ye shall say, Be lifted up, and be cast into the sea, it shall be done.

22. And, all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. 

23.  And, when he, entered, the temple, the Chief-priests and the Elders of the people, came unto him as he was teaching, saying, By what authority, these things, art thou doing? and, who, to thee, gave, this authority?

24. And, making answer, Jesus said unto them—I also, will ask, you, one thing,—which if ye tell me, I also, will tell, you, by what authority, these things, I am doing:—

25. The immersion by John, whence was it? Of heaven, or of men? But, they, began to deliberate among themselves, saying—If we say, Of heaven; He will say unto us, Wherefore then did ye not believe him?

26. But, if we say, Of men, we fear the multitude, for, all, as a prophet, are holding John.

27. And, making answer to Jesus, they said—We know not. He also, said unto them—Neither do, I, tell, you, by what authority, these things, I am doing. 

28.  But how, to you, doth it seem? A man, had two sons: coming unto the first, he said, Son! go thy way, to-day, be working in the vineyard.

29. And, he, answering, said, I, sir! and went not;

30. And, coming unto the second, he spake, in like manner,—and, he, answering, said, I will not: afterwards, smitten with regret, he went.

31. Which of the two, did the will of the father? They say, The latter. Jesus saith unto them—Verily, I say unto you, the tax-collectors and the harlots, are going before you, into the kingdom of God;

32. For John came unto you, in a way of righteousness, and ye believed him not,—but, the tax-collectors and the harlots, believed him; and, ye, seeing it, were not even smitten with regret, afterwards, so as to believe him. 

33.  Another parable, hear ye:—A man there was, a householder, who planted a vineyard, and, a wall around it, placed, and digged in it a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,—and left home.

34. And, when the season of fruits drew near, He sent forth his servants unto the husbandmen to receive his fruits.

35. And the husbandmen, taking his servants, one, indeed, they beat, and, another, slew,—and, another, stoned.

36. Again, sent he forth other servants, more than the first, and they did unto them, likewise.

37. Afterwards, however, he sent forth unto them his son, saying,—They will pay deference unto my son!

38. But, the husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves,—This, is, the heir: Come on! Let us slay him, and have his inheritance.

39. And, taking him, they cast him forth outside the vineyard,—and slew him.

40. When therefore the master of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?

41. They say unto him—Miserable men! Miserably, will he destroy them; and will let out, the vineyard, to other husbandmen, who will render unto him the fruits in their seasons.

42. Jesus saith unto them—Have ye, never, read in the Scriptures, A stone which the builders rejected, the same, hath become, head of the corner: From the Lord, hath this come to pass, and is marvellous in our eyes.

43. Wherefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God, will be taken away from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof:

44. [And, he that falleth on this stone, will be sorely bruised; but, on whomsoever it may fall, it will utterly destroy him.]

45. And the Chief-priests and the Pharisees, hearing his parables, took note, that, concerning them, he was speaking.

46. And, seeking to secure him, they feared the multitudes; since, for a prophet, were they holding him.  

## Matthew 22

1. And, answering, Jesus, again, spake in parables unto them, saying:—

2. The kingdom of the heavens hath become like a man, a king,—who made a marriage-feast for his son;

3. And sent his servants, to call the invited into the marriage-feast,—and they would not come.

4. Again, sent he other servants, saying—Say to the invited, Lo! my dinner, have I prepared, mine oxen and my fatlings, are slain,—and, all things, are, ready: Come ye into the marriage-feast.

5. And, they, slighting it, went off, one, indeed, into his own field, and, another, unto his merchandise,—

6. And, the rest, securing his servants, ill-treated and slew them.

7. And, the king, was provoked to anger,—and, sending his armies, destroyed those murderers, and, their city, set on fire.

8. Then, saith he unto his servants—The marriage, indeed, is ready,—but, the invited, were not, worthy;

9. Be going, therefore, into the crossways of the roads, and, as many as ye shall find, call ye into the marriage-feast.

10. And those servants, going forth, into the roads, gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good,—and filled was the bride-chamber with guests.

11. But the king, entering to view the guests, saw there a man, who had not put on a wedding-garment,—

12. And saith unto him—Friend! how camest thou in here, not having a wedding-garment? And, he, was put to silence.

13. Then, the king said unto the ministers, Binding him feet and hands, cast him forth into the darkness, outside: There, shall be wafting and gnashing of teeth.

14. For, many, are called, but, few, chosen. 

15.  Then, went the Pharisees and took, counsel, that they might ensnare him, in discourse.

16. And they sent forth to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher! we know that, true, thou art, and, the way of God, in truth, dost teach, and it concerneth thee not about anyone,—for thou lookest not unto the face of men:

17. Tell us then, how, to thee, it seemeth? Is it allowable to give tax unto Caesar, or not?

18. But Jesus, taking note of their wickedness, said—Why are ye tempting me, hypocrites?

19. Shew me the coin appointed for the tax. And, they, brought unto him a denary.

20. And he saith unto them—Whose, is this image and the inscription?

21. They say—Caesar’s. Then, saith he unto them—Render, therefore, the things of Caesar, unto Caesar,—and, the things of God, unto God.

22. And, hearing, they marvelled,—and, leaving him, departed. 

23.  On that day, there came unto him Sadducees, who say, there is, no resurrection—and they questioned him,

24. saying—Teacher! Moses, said, If any man die not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

25. Now there were, with us, seven brethren; and, the first, marrying, died, and not having seed, left his wife unto his brother.

26. Likewise, the second also, and the third,—unto the seven.

27. And, last of all, died, the wife.

28. In the resurrection, therefore,—Of which of the seven, shall she be wife? For, all, had her.

29. And Jesus answering, said—Ye are deceiving yourselves, knowing neither the Scriptures, nor yet the power of God.

30. For, in the resurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but, as messengers in the heaven, are they.

31. But, as touching the resurrection of the dead—Have ye not read what was spoken unto you by God, saying—

32. I, am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?—He is not God, of the dead, but, of the living.

33. And, the multitudes, hearing, were being struck with astonishment at his teaching. 

34.  Now, the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, were brought together with one accord;

35. and one from among them, a lawyer, proposed a question, putting him to the test:

36. Teacher! which commandment, is greatest in the law?

37. And, he, said unto him—Thou shalt love the Lord thy God—with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind:

38. This, is the great and first commandment.

39. The second, like it, is, this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

40. In these two commandments, all the law, is contained, and the prophets. 

41.  Now, the Pharisees having come together, Jesus questioned them, saying—

42. How, to you, doth it seem, concerning the Christ? Whose son, is he? They say unto him—David’s.

43. He saith unto them—How then doth, David, in spirit, call him, Lord, saying—

44. The Lord, hath said unto, my Lord,—Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool?

45. If then, David, calleth him, Lord, How, is he, his son?

46. And, no one, was able to answer him a word, neither durst anyone, from that day, question him, any more.  

## Matthew 23

1. Then, Jesus spake unto the multitudes and unto his disciples,

2. saying—Upon Moses’ seat, have sat down, the Scribes and the Pharisees:

3. All things, therefore, whatsoever they tell you, do and observe,—but, according to their works, do ye not, for they, say, and do not, perform.

4. But they bind together heavy burdens, and lay upon men’s shoulders, whereas, they, with their finger, are not willing to move them.

5. But, all their works, they do, to be gazed at, by men,—for they make broad their amulets, and make large their fringes,

6. And dearly love the first couch in the chief meals, and the first seats in the synagogues,

7. And the salutations in the market-places, and to be called by men, Rabbi.

8. But, ye,—do not be called Rabbi,—for, one, is your Teacher, and, all ye, are brethren;

9. And, father, be none of you called, upon the earth, for, one, is your Father, the Heavenly;

10. Neither be called leaders, for, your leader, is one, the Christ;

11. And, the greatest of you, shall be to you, a minister;

12. And, whoever shall exalt himself, shall be, abased, and, whoever shall abase himself, shall be, exalted, 

13.  But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because ye are locking up the kingdom of the heavens before men,—for, ye, are not entering, neither, them who are entering, suffer ye to enter.

14. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: because ye compass sea and dry land, to make one convert—and, when it is done, ye make him a son of gehenna, twofold more than ye.

15. Alas for you, blind guides! that say—Whosoever shall swear by the Temple, it is, nothing, but, whosoever shall swear by the gold of the Temple, is bound:

16. Foolish and blind! for which is, greater, The gold, or the Temple that hath hallowed the gold?

17. And, whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is, nothing, but, whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, is bound:

18. Blind! for which is greater, The gift, or the altar that halloweth the gift?

19. He therefore that hath sworn by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all that is upon it;

20. And, he that hath sworn by the Temple, sweareth by it, and by him who dwelleth therein;

21. And, he that hath sworn by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him who sitteth thereupon.

22. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because ye tithe the mint and the anise and the cummin,—and have dismissed the weightier matters of the law—the justice, the mercy, and the faith; whereas, these, it was binding, to do, and, those, not to, dismiss.

23. Blind guides! Straining out the gnat, but, the camel, swallowing.

24. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish,—while, within, they are full of plunder and intemperance.

25. Blind Pharisee! cleanse, first, the inside, of the cup [and of the dish], that, the outside thereof, may become, clean.

26. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because ye make yourselves like sepulchres whitewashed, which, outside, indeed, appear, beautiful, but, within, are full, of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness,—

27. Thus, ye also, outside, indeed, appear to men, righteous, but, within, are full, of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

28. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the righteous,

29. and say—If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been their partners in the blood of the prophets:

30. So that ye bear witness against yourselves, that ye are, sons, of them who murdered the prophets.

31. And, ye, fill ye up the measure of your fathers!

32. Serpents! broods of vipers! how should ye flee from the judgment of gehenna? 

33.  For this cause, lo! I, send unto you, prophets and wise men and scribes,—some from among them, ye will slay and crucify, And some from among them ye will—scourge in your synagogues, and pursue from city to city:

34. That there may come upon you—all righteous blood poured out upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous, unto the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye murdered between the Temple and the altar.

35. Verily, I say unto you—All these things, will have come, upon this generation.

36. Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that slayeth the prophets, and stoneth them that have been sent unto her,—how often, would I have gathered thy children, like as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,—and ye would not!

37. Lo! your house is left to you;

38. For I say unto you—in no wise, may ye see me, henceforth, until ye say, Blessed, is he that cometh, in the name of the Lord!  

## Matthew 24

1. And, Jesus coming forth, from the temple, was taking his departure, when his disciples came forward to point out to him the buildings of the temple.

2. But, he, answering, said unto them—Are ye not beholding all these things? Verily, I say unto you—in no wise, shall there be left here, stone upon stone, which shall not be thrown down.

3. And, as he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him, privately, saying—Tell us, when these things shall be,—and what the sign of thy presence, and the conclusion of the age. 

4.  And, answering, Jesus said unto them—Be taking heed, lest anyone, deceive, you;

5. For, many, will come upon my name, saying—I, am the Christ,—and will, deceive many.

6. Moreover ye will be sure to be hearing of wars, and rumours of wars: Mind! be not alarmed, for it must needs happen,—but, not yet, is, the end;

7. For there will arise—nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,—and there will be famines and earthquakes, in places.

8. But, all these things, are a beginning of birth-pangs.

9. Then, will they deliver you up into tribulation, and will slay you,—and ye will be men hated by all the nations, because of my name

10. And, then, will many be caused to stumble, and, one another, will deliver up, and will hate one another;

11. And, many false prophets, will arise, and deceive, many;

12. And, because of lawlessness being brought to the full, the love of the many, will grew cold.

13. But, he that hath endured throughout, the same, shall be saved.

14. And this glad message of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the inhabited earth, for a witness unto all the nations,—and, then, will have come, the end.

15. Whensoever, therefore, ye shall see the abomination desolation, that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place,—he that readeth, let him think,

16. Then, they who are in Judaea, let them flee into the mountains;

17. And, he that is on the house-top, let him not come down, to take away the things out of his house;

18. And, he that is in the field, let him not turn back, to take away his mantle.

19. But alas! for the women with child, and for them that are giving suck, in those days;

20. But be praying that your flight, may not happen in winter, nor on sabbath;

21. For there will be then, Great tribulation, such as hath not happened, from the beginning of the world, until the present time, neither in any wise shall happen.

22. And, except those days had been shortened, no flesh had been saved; but, for the sake of the chosen, those days shall be shortened.

23. Then, if any, unto you, say—Lo! here, is the Christ, or, there, Do not believe it;

24. For there will arise, false Christs, and false prophets,—and they will show great signs and wonders, so that, if possible, even the chosen, should be deceived:—

25. Lo! I have foretold you.

26. If therefore they should say unto you, Lo! in the desert, he is, Do not go forth; Lo! in the chambers, Do not believe it.

27. For, just as the lightning goeth forth from the east, and shineth unto the west, so, shall be the presence of the Son of Man.

28. Wheresoever, the corpse, shall be, there, shall be gathered, the vultures!

29. But, straightway after the tribulation of those days, the sun, will be darkened, and, the moon, will not give her brightness, and, the stars, will fall from heaven,—and, the powers of the heavens, will be shaken;

30. And, then, will be displayed—The sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and, then, will smite their breasts—all the tribes of the earth; and they will see the Son of Man—coming upon the clouds of heaven, with great power and glory.

31. And he will send forth his messengers, with a great trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen—Out of the four winds, from heavens’ bounds, unto their bounds. 

32.  Now, from the fig-tree, learn ye, the parable:—When, already, her young branch, becometh tender, and the leaves, may be sprouting, ye observe, that, near, is, the summer:

33. Thus, ye also, when ye shall see all these things, observe ye, that, near, he is, at the doors.

34. Verily, I say unto you—In nowise, shall this generation, pass away, until all these things, shall happen:

35. The heaven and the earth, shall pass away, but, my words, shall, in nowise, pass away.

36. But, concerning that day and hour, no one, knoweth, neither the messengers of the heavens, nor the Son,—save the Father only.

37. For, just as the days of Noah, so, will be the presence of the Son of Man;

38. For, as they were in those days that were before the flood, feeding and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage,—until the day Noah entered into the ark;

39. And they observed not, until the flood came and took away all together, so, will be, the presence of the Son of Man.

40. Then, shall there be two men in the field,—one, is taken near, and, one, is left behind:

41. Two women grinding at the mill,—one, is taken near, and, one, is left behind.

42. Be watching, therefore, for ye know not, on what manner of day, your Lord is coming.

43. But there is, one thing, ye know—That, if the householder, had known, in what watch, the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert, and not have suffered his house to be dug through.

44. Wherefore, ye also, be getting ready, because, in what hour ye are, not thinking, The Son of Man doth come.

45. Who then is the faithful and prudent servant, whom the master hath appointed over his household, to give them food in season?

46. Happy! that servant, whom his master, when he cometh, shall find so doing!

47. Verily, I say unto you—Over all his substance, will he appoint him.

48. But, if that wicked servant should say in his heart—My master, delayeth,

49. And begin to be striking his fellow-servants, and eating and drinking with the drunken,

50. The master of that servant, will have come, on a day when he is not expecting, and in an hour when he is not observing,—

51. And will cut him asunder; and, his part, with the hypocrites, will appoint: There, shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth!  

## Matthew 25

1. Then, will the kingdom of the heavens become like unto, ten virgins, who, taking their torches, went forth to meet the bridegroom.

2. Now, five of them, were foolish, and, five, prudent.

3. For, the foolish—though they took, their torches, took not with them, oil:

4. But, the prudent, took oil in their vessels, with their torches.

5. Now, the bridegroom, delaying, they all became drowsy, and were sleeping.

6. And, at midnight, an outcry hath been made—Lo! the bridegroom! Be going forth to meet him!

7. Then, arose all those virgins, and trimmed their torches.

8. And, the foolish, unto the prudent, said—Give us of your oil, because, our torches, are going out.

9. But the prudent, answered, saying—Lest once, by any means, there be not enough for us and you, be going rather unto them that sell, and buy for yourselves

10. But, as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and, they who were ready, went in with him, into the marriage-feast, and, the door was locked.

11. But, afterwards, came the other virgins also, saying—Lord! Lord! open unto us!

12. And, he, answering, said—Verily, I say unto you, I know you not.

13. Be watching, therefore, because ye know, neither the day nor the hour. 

14.  For it is, just as a man, who, going from home, called his own servants, and delivered up to them his substance;

15. And, to one, indeed, gave he five talents, and, to another, two, and, to another, one,—to each according to his particular ability, and went from home.

16. Straightway, he who, the five talents, had received, went and traded with them, and gained other five:

17. Likewise, he of the two, gained other two:

18. But, he who the one had received, went away, and digged up ground, and hid the silver of his lord.

19. And, after a long time, cometh the lord of those servants, and reckoneth with them.

20. And he who the five talents had received, coming forward, brought other five talents, saying,—Lord! five talents, to me, thou didst deliver up: See! other five talents, I gained.

21. His lord said unto him—Well-done! good and faithful servant,—Over a few things wast thou faithful, over many things, will I appoint thee: Enter into the joy of thy lord.

22. He also of the two talents, coming forward, said—Lord! two talents, to me, didst thou deliver up: See! other two talents, I gained.

23. His lord said unto him—Well-done! good and faithful servant,—Over a few things, wast thou faithful, over many things, will I appoint thee: Enter into the joy of thy lord.

24. But he also who, the one talent, had received, coming forward, said—Lord I knew thee, that thou art a, hard, man, reaping, where thou hast not sown,—and gathering, whence thou hast not winnowed;

25. And, overcome with fear, I went away, and hid thy talent in the ground: See! thou hast what is thine!

26. And his lord, answering, said unto him—O wicked servant, and cowardly, knewest thou that I reap, where I have not sown, and gather, whence I have not winnowed?

27. It was binding on thee, therefore, to cast my silver into the money-changers,—and, I, when I, came, might have obtained what was mine, with interest.

28. Therefore take away, from him, the talent, and give unto him that hath the ten talents;

29. For, to every one that hath, shall be given, and he shall be made to abound; but, from him that hath not, even what he hath, shall be taken away from him:

30. And, the unprofitable servant, cast ye forth into the darkness, outside: There, shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 

31.  But, whensoever the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the messengers with him, then will he sit on his throne of glory;

32. And there will be gathered before him, all the nations, and he will separate them one from another, just as, the shepherd! separateth the sheep from the goats,—

33. And he will set, the sheep, indeed, on his right hand, but, the goats, on the left.

34. Then, will the king say to those on his right hand: Come ye, the blessed of my Father! Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;

35. For I hungered, and ye gave me to eat, I thirsted, and ye gave me drink, a stranger, was I, and ye took me home,

36. Naked, and ye clothed me, sick, and ye visited me, in prison, was I, and ye came unto me.

37. Then, will the righteous answer him, saying: Lord! when, saw we thee—hungry, and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

38. And, when, saw we thee—a stranger, and took thee home, or naked, and clothed thee?

39. And, when, saw we thee—sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

40. And, answering, the king will say unto them: Verily, I say unto you—Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my least brethren, unto me, ye did it.

41. Then, will he say unto those also, on his left hand: Depart ye from me, accursed ones! Into the age-abiding fire, which hath been prepared for the adversary and his messengers;

42. For I hungered, and ye gave me not to eat, [and] I was thirsty, and ye gave me not to drink,

43. A stranger, was I, and ye took me not home, naked, and ye clothed me not, sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

44. Then, will, they also, answer, saying: Lord! when saw we thee—hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and ministered not unto thee?

45. Then, will he answer them, saying: Verily, I say unto you—Inasmuch as ye did it not, unto one of these least, neither unto me, did ye it.

46. And, these, shall go away, into, age-abiding, correction, but, the righteous, into, age-abiding, life.  

## Matthew 26

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus ended all these words, he said unto his disciples:

2. Ye know that, after two days, the passover, taketh place,—and, the Son of Man, is to be delivered up, to be crucified.

3. Then, were gathered together, the High-priests and the Elders of the people, into the court of the High-priest who was called Caiaphas;

4. and they took counsel together, in order that, Jesus, by guile, they might secure, and slay.

5. They were saying, however: Not during the feast, lest, an uproar, arise among the people. 

6.  But, Jesus, happening to be in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. there came unto him a woman, holding an alabaster-jar of costly perfume, and she poured it down upon his head, as he was reclining.

8. And the disciples, seeing it, were greatly displeased, saying—To what end, this loss?

9. For this could have been sold for much, and given to the destitute.

10. But Jesus, taking note, said unto them—Why vex ye the woman? for, a seemly work, hath she wrought for me;

11. For, always, the destitute, have ye with you,—but, me, not always, have ye;

12. For, she, pouring this perfume upon my body, so as to prepare me for burial, did it.

13. Verily, I say unto you—Wheresoever this glad-message shall be proclaimed in all the world, also what she did, will be told, as a memorial of her. 

14.  Then, went one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, unto the High-priests,

15. and said—What are ye willing to give unto me? and, I, unto you, will deliver him up. And they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.

16. And, from that time, was he seeking a favourable opportunity that he might, deliver him up. 

17.  And, on the first of the days of unleavened bread, the disciples came unto Jesus, saying—Where wilt thou, that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?

18. And, he, said—Go your way into the city, unto such-a-one, and say to him, The teacher, saith, My season, is, near, with thee, will I keep the passover, with my disciples.

19. And the disciples did, as Jesus directed them, and made ready the passover.

20. And, when, evening, came, he was reclining with the twelve [disciples];

21. and, as they were eating, he said—Verily, I say unto you, One from among you, will deliver me up.

22. And, being exceedingly grieved, they began to be saying to him, each one—Can it be, I, Lord?

23. And, he, answering, said—He who hath dipped with me his hand in the bowl, the same, will deliver me up.

24. The Son of Man, indeed, goeth his way, according as it is written concerning him,—But alas! for that man, through whom the Son of Man, is being delivered up: Well, had it been for him, if, that man, had not been born!

25. And Judas, who was delivering him up, answering, said—Can it be, I, Rabbi? He saith unto him—Thou, hast said. 

26.  And, as they were eating, Jesus, taking a loaf and blessing, brake,—and, giving to his disciples, said—Take, eat! This, is, my body.

27. And, taking a cup, and giving thanks, he gave unto them, saying—Drink of it, all of you;

28. For, this, is my blood of the covenant, which, for many, is to be poured out, for remission of sins.

29. Moreover, I say unto you—In nowise, will I drink, henceforth, of this produce of the vine, until that day, whensoever I shall drink it with you, new, in the kingdom of my Father.

30. And, having sung praise, they went forth unto the Mount of Olives. 

31.  Then, Jesus saith unto them—All ye, will find cause of stumbling in me, during this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and, the sheep of the flock, will be scattered abroad;

32. But, after my arising, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. Now Peter, answering, said unto him—Though, all, shall find cause of stumbling in thee, I, shall never find cause of stumbling.

34. Jesus saith unto him: Verily, I say unto thee—During this night, before a cock crow, Thrice, wilt thou deny me.

35. Peter saith unto him: Even though it be needful for me, with thee to die, in nowise, will I deny thee. Likewise, all the disciples also, said. 

36.  Then Jesus cometh with them, into a place called Gethsemane,—and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.

37. And, taking with him, Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and to be in great distress.

38. Then, saith he unto them: Encompassed with grief, is my soul, unto death: Abide ye here, and be watching with me.

39. And, going forward a little, he fell upon his face, offering prayer, and saying—My Father! If it is possible, let this cup pass from me,—Nevertheless, not as, I, will, but as, thou, wilt.

40. And he cometh unto his disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and said unto Peter—Thus, powerless are ye, one hour, to watch with me?

41. Be watching and praying, that ye may not enter into temptation: The spirit, indeed, is, eager, but, the flesh, weak.

42. Again, a second time, departing he prayed, saying: My Father! If it is impossible for this to pass, except I, drink, it, Accomplished, be, thy will.

43. And coming, he, again, found them sleeping, for their eyes had become heavy.

44. And, leaving them, he, again, departed, and prayed a third time, the same word, saying again.

45. Then, cometh he unto the disciples, and saith unto them,—Ye are sleeping what time remaineth, and taking your rest: Lo! the hour hath drawn near, and, the Son of Man, is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.

46. Arise! let us be going,—Lo! he that delivereth me up, hath drawn near. 

47.  And, while, yet, he was speaking, lo! Judas, one of the twelve, came, and, with him, a large multitude, with swords and clubs, from the High-priests and Elders of the people.

48. And, he who was delivering him up, gave them a sign, saying—Whomsoever I shall kiss, he, it is,—secure him.

49. And, straightway, coming unto Jesus, he said—Joy to thee! Rabbi, and eagerly kissed him.

50. But, Jesus, said unto him—Friend! wherefore art thou here? Then, coming forward, they thrust their hands upon Jesus, and secured him.

51. And lo! one of those with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, grasped his sword, and smiting the servant of the High-priest, cut off his ear.

52. Then, Jesus saith unto him—Put back thy sword into its place, for, all they who take a sword, by a sword, shall perish.

53. Or thinkest thou that I cannot call upon my Father, and he will set near me, even now, more than twelve legions of messengers?

54. How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that, thus, it must needs come to pass?

55. In that hour, said Jesus unto the multitudes: As against a robber, came ye forth, with swords and clubs, to arrest me? Daily in the temple, used I to sit teaching, and ye secured me not;

56. But, this, hath, wholly, come to pass, that, the Scriptures of the prophets, may be fulfilled. Then, the disciples, all forsaking him, fled. 

57.  And, they who secured Jesus, led him away unto Caiaphas the High-priest, where the Scribes and the Elders gathered themselves together.

58. Now, Peter, was following him afar off, unto the court of the High-priest,—and, entering within, was sitting with the attendants, to see the end.

59. Now, the High-priests and all the High-council, were seeking false-witness against Jesus, that they might, put him to death;

60. and found not any, though many came forward as false-witnesses. At length, however, there came forward, two,

61. and said: This, man said—I am able to pull down the shrine of God, and, in three days, to, build, it.

62. And the High-priest, arising, said unto him—Nothing, answerest thou? What are these, against thee bearing witness?

63. But, Jesus, was silent. And, the High-priest, said unto him: I put thee on oath, by the Living God, that, to us, thou say—Whether, thou, art the Christ, the Son of God.

64. Jesus saith unto him: Thou, hast said; Moreover, I say unto you—Hereafter, ye will see the Son of Man, sitting on the right hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.

65. Then, the High-priest rent asunder his garments, saying—He hath spoken profanely! What further need have we, of witnesses? Lo! now, ye have heard the profanity!

66. How, to you, doth it seem? And, they, answering, said: Guilty of death, he is.

67. Then, spat they into his face, and buffeted him; and, others, struck him smartly,

68. saying—Prophesy unto us, O Christ! Who is he that struck thee? 

69.  Now, Peter, was sitting without, in the court; and there came unto him a certain female servant, saying—Thou also, wast with Jesus, the Galilaean.

70. But, he, denied before all, saying—I know not what thou sayest.

71. And, when he went out into the porch, another female saw him, and said unto them who were there—This, one was with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. And, again, he denied, with an oath—I know not the man.

73. And, after a little, the by-standers, coming forward, said unto Peter: Truly, thou also, art, from among them, for, thy very speech, maketh thee, manifest.

74. Then, began he to be cursing and swearing—I know not the man! And, straightway, a cock crowed.

75. And Peter was put in mind of the declaration of Jesus, of his having said—Before a cock crow, thrice, wilt thou utterly deny me; and, going forth outside, he wept bitterly.  

## Matthew 27

1. Now, when morning came, all the High-priests and Elders of the people took, counsel, against Jesus, so as to put him to death:

2. and, binding him, they led him away, and delivered him up unto Pilate the governor.

3. Then, Judas who had delivered him up, seeing that he was condemned, being smitten with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver unto the High-priests and Elders,

4. saying—I have sinned, in delivering up righteous blood. But, they, said—What is that to us? thou, shalt see to it for thyself.

5. And, throwing the pieces of silver into the Temple, he withdrew, and, going away, hanged himself.

6. But, the High-priests, taking the pieces of silver, said—It is not allowed, to cast them into the treasury; since, a price of blood, they are.

7. And, taking counsel, they bought with them, the field of the potter, as a burial-place for strangers.

8. Wherefore, that field hath been called Field of Blood, until this day.

9. Then, was fulfilled, that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, as the value of him whom they had valued, whom they had valued, of Israel’s sons,—

10. And gave them for the field of the potter, as, the Lord, directed me. 

11.  Now, Jesus, stood before the governor; and the governor questioned him, saying—Thou, art the king of the Jews? And, Jesus, said—Thou, sayest.

12. And, while he was being accused by the High-priests and Elders, he answered nothing.

13. Then, Pilate saith unto him—Hearest thou not how many things against thee they are bearing witness?

14. And he answered him, no not so much as a single word, so that the governor was marvelling exceedingly.

15. But, feast by feast, the governor had been wont to release one unto the multitude, a prisoner whom they were desiring.

16. Now they had at that time a distinguished prisoner, called, Barabbas.

17. They therefore having come together, Pilate, said to them—Whom will ye I should release unto you? Barabbas? or Jesus, who is called Christ?

18. For he knew that, for envy, they had delivered him up.

19. And, as he was sitting upon the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man, for, many things, have I suffered this day, by dream, because of him.

20. But, the High-priests and the elders, persuaded the multitudes, that they should claim Barabbas, but, Jesus, should, destroy.

21. Now the governor, answering, said unto them—Which of the two desire ye I should release unto you? And they said—Barabbas!

22. Pilate saith unto them—What then shall I do unto Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say—Let him be crucified!

23. But, he, said—Indeed! what evil hath he done? But, they, vehemently, were crying aloud, saying—Let him be crucified!

24. And Pilate, seeing, that, nothing, it availed, but rather, a tumult, was arising, taking water, washed his hands of it before the multitude, saying—Innocent, am I, of the blood of this man,—Ye, shall see to it for yourselves.

25. And all the people, answering, said—His blood be upon us and upon our children! 

26.  Then released he unto them Barabbas, but, scourging, Jesus, delivered him up, that he might be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor, taking Jesus aside into the judgment-hall, gathered unto him all the band;

28. and, unclothing him, a scarlet scarf, put they about him,—

29. and, plaiting a crown out of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand,—and, kneeling before him, began to mock him, saying—Joy to thee, King of the Jews!

30. And, spitting upon him, they took the reed, and began striking upon his head.

31. And, when they had mocked him, they put off him the scarf, and put on him his garments, and led him away unto the crucifying.

32. And, as they were going forth, they found a man of Cyrene, by name, Simon,—the same, they impressed to bear his cross. 

33.  And, coming into a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Skull-place,

34. they gave him to drink, wine, with gall, mingled, and, tasting, he would not drink.

35. And, having crucified him, they parted among themselves his garments, casting a cloth;

36. and, being seated, were watching him there.

37. And they put up, over his head, his accusation, written—THIS, IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. Then, are crucified with him, two robbers,—one on the right hand, and one on the left.

39. And, they who were passing by, were reviling him, shaking their heads,

40. and saying—The man that taketh down the Temple and in three days buildeth it! Save, thyself! If thou art God’s, Son, come down from the cross.

41. Likewise, the High-priests, [also], mocking, with the Scribes and Elders, were saying: Others, he saved,—Himself, he cannot save:

42. Israel’s King, he is! Let him come down, now, from the cross,—and we will believe on him!

43. He hath put confidence upon God, Let him rescue him, now, if he desireth him; for he said, I am, God’s Son.

44. And, the same thing, the robbers also, who were crucified with him, were casting in his teeth.

45. Now, from the sixth hour, darkness, came upon all the land—until the ninth hour.

46. And, about the ninth hour, Jesus uttered a cry, with a loud voice, saying—Eloi! Eloi! lema sabachthanei? that is, My God! my God! to what end hast thou forsaken me?

47. Now certain of them who were there standing, when they heard, began to say—This man, calleth, Elijah.

48. And, straightway, one from among them, running, and taking a sponge, and filling it with vinegar and putting it on a reed, was giving him to drink;

49. but, the rest, said—Stay! let us see whether Elijah is coming, and will save him. [[But, another, taking a spear, pierced his side, and there came forth water and blood]]. 

50.  And, Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, dismissed the spirit.

51. And lo! the veil of the Temple, was rent, from top to bottom, into two; and, the earth, was shaken, and, the rocks, were rent;

52. and, the tombs, were opened and, many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep, arose,—

53. and, coming forth out of the tombs after his arising, entered into, the holy city, and plainly appeared unto many.

54. Now, the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things coming to pass, were violently affrighted, saying—Truly, God’s Son, was, he!

55. Now there were there, many women, from afar, beholding, who indeed had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him;

56. among whom was Mary the Magdalene, also Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 

57.  And, when, evening, arrived, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, whose name was Joseph, who also, himself, had been discipled unto Jesus.

58. The same, going unto Pilate, claimed the body of Jesus. Then, Pilate commanded it to be given up.

59. And Joseph, taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean Indian-cloth,

60. and laid it in his new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock, and, rolling near a large stone unto the door of the tomb, departed.

61. Now there were there, Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.

62. And, on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the High-priests and the Pharisee were gathered together unto Pilate,

63. saying—Sir! we have been put in mind that, that deceiver, said, while yet living,—After three days, will I, arise.

64. Command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day,—lest once the disciples should come and steal him, and say unto the people, He hath arisen from the dead! and, the last deception, shall be, worse than the first.

65. Pilate saith unto them—Ye have a guard: Go your way, secure it for yourselves, as ye know how.

66. And, they, went and secured for themselves the sepulchre, sealing the stone, with the guard.  

## Matthew 28

1. And, late in the week, when it was on the point of dawning into the first of the week, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to view the sepulchre.

2. And lo! a great commotion occurred,—for, a messenger of the Lord, descending out of heaven, and coming near, had rolled away the stone, and was sitting upon it.

3. Now his appearance, was, as lightning, and, his clothing, white as snow;

4. and, for fear of him, they who were keeping watch were thrown into a commotion, and became as dead men.

5. But the messenger, answering, said unto the women—Be not, ye, afraid! For I know that, Jesus the crucified, ye are seeking:

6. He is not here, for he hath arisen, as he said. Come! see the place where he lay;

7. And, quickly going, tell his disciples—He hath arisen from the dead, and lo! he is going before you into Galilee;—There, shall ye yourselves see him: Lo! I have told you.

8. And, departing quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring tidings unto his disciples.

9. And lo! Jesus, met them, saying—Joy to you! And, they, going forward, held his feet, and worshipped him.

10. Then, Jesus saith unto them—Be not afraid! Go your way, bear tidings unto my brethren, that they may depart into Galilee; and, there, shall they themselves see me. 

11.  Now as they were, going, lo! certain of the guard, went into the city and reported unto the High-priests all the things that had come to pass;

12. and, being gathered together with the Elders and taking counsel, sufficient pieces of silver, gave they unto the soldiers,—

13. saying—Say ye, His disciples, coming, by night, stole him, while we were sleeping;

14. And, if this be reported unto the governor, we, will persuade him, and will make, you, free from care.

15. And, they, taking the pieces of silver, did as they were instructed. And this account was spread abroad among the Jews…until this [very] day. 

16.  And, the eleven disciples, went into Galilee, unto the mountain which, Jesus, had appointed them;

17. and, seeing him, they worshipped, but, some, doubted.

18. And Jesus, coming near, spake unto them, saying—All authority, in heaven and on earth, hath been given unto me;

19. Go ye, therefore, and disciple all the nations, Immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,—

20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I myself have commanded you, And lo! I, am, with you, all the days, until the conclusion of the age.
