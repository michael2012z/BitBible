# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, through the will of God,—according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus;—

2. Unto Timothy, my beloved child: Favour, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. Grateful, am I, unto God,—unto whom I am rendering divine service from my progenitors in a pure conscience, that, incessant, hold I the remembrance, concerning thee, in my supplications; day and night,

4. longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears,—in order that, with joy, I may be filled:

5. A reminder, having received, of the unfeigned faith, that is in thee,—such, as dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice,—I am persuaded, moreover, that [it dwelleth], in thee also. 

6.  For which cause, I put thee in remembrance, to be stirring up God’s gift of favour, which is in thee through means of the laying on of my hands;

7. For God hath not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and love, and correction.

8. Be not thou, therefore, put to shame—with regard to the witness of our Lord, nor with regard to me his prisoner; but suffer hardship together with the glad-message according to the power of God,—

9. Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to the peculiar purpose and favour—which was given to us in Christ Jesus before age-during times,

10. But hath now been made manifest through means of the forthshining of our Saviour Christ Jesus,—Who, indeed, hath abolished death, and hath thrown light upon life and incorruptibility, through means of the glad-message:

11. Whereunto, I, have been appointed herald and apostle and teacher;

12. For which cause, these things also, am I suffering; nevertheless I am not being put to shame, for I know him whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is, able, to guard, that which I have entrusted, [to him] unto, that, day.

13. An outline, have thou, of healthful discourses which from me thou hast heard—with the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus:

14. The noble thing entrusted [to thee], do thou guard, through means of the Holy Spirit which dwelleth within us. 

15.  Thou knowest this—that all they who are in Asia have turned away from me,—of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

16. The Lord grant mercy unto the house, of Onesiphorus, in that, ofttimes, hath he refreshed me, and, as regardeth my chain, hath not been put to shame,

17. But, happening to be in Rome, he diligently sought out and found me,—

18. The Lord grant him to find mercy from [the] Lord in, that, day;—and, how many times, in Ephesus, he hath ministered, better art, thou, getting to know.  

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Thou, therefore, my child, be empowering thyself in the favour that is in Christ Jesus,

2. And, the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same, entrust thou unto faithful men, such as shall be, competent, to teach, others also.

3. Take thy part in suffering hardship, as a brave soldier of Christ Jesus:—

4. No one that is serving as a soldier, entangleth himself with the matters of his livelihood, that he may please him that hath summoned him to serve as a soldier;

5. If, moreover, any man, contend even in the games, he is not crowned, unless, lawfully, he contend;

6. The toiling husbandman, ought, first, of the fruits, to partake:

7. Think, as to what I am speaking; for the Lord will give thee discernment in all things. 

8.  Keep in mind Jesus Christ—raised from among the dead, of the seed of David,—according to my joyful message:

9. In which I am suffering hardship, even unto bonds, as an evil-doer; but, the word of God, is not bound.

10. For this cause, am I enduring, all things, for the sake of the chosen, in order that, they also, may obtain, the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus along with glory age-abiding.

11. Faithful, the saying—for, If we have died together, we shall also live together,

12. If we endure, we shall also reign together; If we shall deny, he also, will deny us,

13. If we are faithless, he, faithful, abideth,—for, deny himself, he cannot! 

14.  Of these things, be putting [them] in remembrance, adjuring [them] before God not to be waging word-battles,—useful, for nothing, occasioning a subversion of them that hearken.

15. Give diligence, thyself, approved, to present unto God,—a workman not to be put to shame, skillfully handling the word of truth.

16. But, the profane pratings, shun; for, unto more ungodliness, will they force themselves on;

17. And, their discourse, as a gangrene, will eat its way;—of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,

18. Men who, concerning the truth, have erred, affirming, a resurrection, already, to have taken place, and are overthrowing the faith, of some. 

19.  Howbeit, the firm foundation of God, standeth, having this seal—The Lord hath acknowledged them who are his, and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord stand aloof from unrighteousness.

20. But, in a great house, there are not only gold and silver vessels, but, also wooden and earthen: and, some, indeed, for honour, while, some, are for dishonour:

21. If, therefore, anyone will, for pureness, sever himself from these, he shall be a vessel for honour, hallowed, meet for the Master’s use, for every good work, prepared. 

22.  But, from the youthful covetings, flee! and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with them who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.

23. But, from the foolish and undisciplined questionings, excuse thyself, knowing that they gender strifes;

24. And, a servant of the Lord, ought not to strive, but to be, gentle, towards all, apt in teaching, ready to endure malice,—

25. In meekness, bringing under discipline them that oppose themselves, lest at any time God should give them repentance unto a personal knowledge of truth,

26. And they should wake up to sobriety out of, the adversary’s, snare,—though they have been taken alive by him for, that one’s, will.  

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But, of this, be taking note—that, in last days, there will set in perilous seasons;

2. For men will be—fond of themselves, fond of money, ostentatious, arrogant, defamers, to parents, unyielding, unthankful, unkind,

3. without natural affection, accepting no truce, given to intrigue, without self-control, uncivilized, unfriendly to good men,

4. traitors, reckless, beclouded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

5. having a form of godliness, but, the power thereof, denying! and, from these, turn away;

6. For, of these, are they who enter into the houses, and captivate silly women, [women] laden with sins, led on by manifold covetings,

7. Ever learning and never, unto a personal knowledge of truth, able to come;

8. Moreover, like as, Jannes and Jambres, withstood Moses, so, these men also, withstand the truth,—men utterly corrupted in their mind, disapproved concerning their faith;

9. But they shall not force their way further, for, their folly, shall be, fully evident, unto all,—as also, that of those men, became. 

10.  But, thou, hast closely studied—my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,

11. persecutions, sufferings, what manner of things, befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, what manner of persecutions, I endured,—and, out of all, the Lord, rescued me;—

12. Yea and, all who are determined to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus, will be persecuted;

13. Whereas, wicked men and howling impostors, will force their way to the worse, deceiving and being deceived.

14. But, thou,—abide in the things which thou hast learned, and been entrusted with, knowing, from whom, thou hast learned [them],—

15. And that, from a babe, those sacred letters, thou hast known which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through the faith which is in Christ Jesus:

16. Every scripture, [is] God-breathed, and profitable—unto teaching, unto conviction, unto correction, unto the discipline that is in righteousness,—

17. In order that, ready, may be the man, of God, unto every good work, being well-prepared.  

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I adjure [thee] before God, and Christ Jesus—Who is about to be judging living and dead,—both as to his forthshining and his kingdom,

2. Proclaim the word, take thy position—in season, out of season,—convince, rebuke, encourage,—with all long-suffering and teaching.

3. For there will be a season—when, the healthful teaching, they will not endure, but, according to their own covetings, will, unto themselves, heap up teachers, because they have an itching ear,

4. And, from the truth, indeed, their ear, will they turn away, while, unto stories, they will turn themselves aside.

5. But, thou,—be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do, the work, of an evangelist, thy ministry, completely fulfill;

6. For, I, already, am being poured out as a drink-offering, and, the season of my release, is at hand,—

7. The noble contest, have I contested, the race, have I finished, the faith, have I kept:

8. Henceforth, lieth by for me—the crown, of righteousness, which the Lord will render unto me in that, day,—The righteous judge,—Ye, not alone unto me, but unto all them also who have loved his forthshining. 

9.  Give diligence to come unto me speedily,

10. For, Demas, hath forsaken me, having loved the present age, and hath journeyed unto Thessalonica; Crescens unto Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia:

11. Luke, alone is with me. Receiving, Mark, back, bring him with thyself, for he is very useful to me for ministering;

12. and, Tychicus, have I sent unto Ephesus.

13. The cloak that I left in Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring; and the scrolls, especially, the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith, of much baseness towards me, hath given proof,—the Lord will render unto him according to his works.—

15. Of whom, be, thou also, on thy guard, for he hath greatly withstood our words. 

16.  In my first defence, no man, came in to help me, but, all, forsook me,—unto them, may it not be reckoned!—

17. But, the Lord, stood by me, and empowered me, in order that, through me, the proclamation, might be fully made, and, all the nations, might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of a lion:—

18. The Lord will rescue me from every wicked work, and will bring me safe into his heavenly kingdom: unto whom be the glory, unto the ages of ages. Amen.

19. Salute Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus, remained in Corinth; but, Trophimus, I left at Miletus, sick.

21. Give diligence to come, before winter. There salute thee—Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and [all] the brethren.

22. The Lord, be with thy spirit. Favour, be with you.
