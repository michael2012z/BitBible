# Leviticus

## Leviticus 1

1. Then called he unto Moses,—and Yahweh spake unto him, out of the tent of meeting, saying:

2. Speak thou unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them When any man, would bring near from among you an oblation, unto Yahweh, from the beasts, from the herd or from the flock, shall ye bring near your oblation. 

3.  If an ascending-sacrifice, be his oblation—of the herd, a male without defect, shall he bring near,—unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, shall he bring it, for its acceptance, before Yahweh.

4. Then shall he lean his hand, upon the head of the ascending-sacrifice,—and it shall be accepted for him to put a propitiatory covering over him;

5. and he shall slay the young bullock before Yahweh,—and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall bring near the blood, and shall dash the blood against the altar round about, [even the altar] that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

6. Then shall he flay the ascending-sacrifice,—and cut it up into its pieces.

7. And the sons of Aaron the priest shall place fire upon the altar,—and arrange wood, upon the fire.

8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall arrange the pieces, the head and the fat,—upon the wood, that is on the fire, that is on the altar.

9. But its inwards and its legs, shall they bathe with water,—then shall the priest make, of the whole, a perfume at the altar, an ascending-sacrifice an altar-flame of a satisfying odour unto Yahweh. 

10.  But, if of the flock, be his oblation,—of the sheep or of the goats, for an ascending-sacrifice, a male without defect, shall he bring near.

11. And he shall slay it on the side of the altar northward, before Yahweh,—and the sons of Aaron the priests shall dash its blood against the altar round about.

12. And he shall cut it up into its pieces, and its head, and its fat,—and the priest shall arrange them upon the wood that is on the fire, that is on the altar,

13. But the inwards and the legs, shall he bathe in water,—then shall the priest bring near the whole and make a perfume at the altar, an ascending-sacrifice, it is an altar-flame of a satisfying odour, unto Yahweh.

14. But, if, of birds, be the ascending-sacrifice of his oblation unto Yahweh, then shall he bring near of the turtle-doves or of the young pigeons, his oblation.

15. And the priest shall bring it near unto the altar shall nip off its head, and make a perfume at the altar,—and its blood shall be drained out upon the wall of the altar.

16. Then shall he take away its crop with its plumage,—and cast it beside the altar, eastward, into the place of fat ashes;

17. and he shall cleave it in its wings—he shall not divide it asunder, so shall the priest make a perfume therewith, at the altar, upon the wood that is on the fire,—an ascending-sacrifice, it is, an altar-flame of a satisfying odour, unto Yahweh.  

## Leviticus 2

1. But, when any person would bring near as an oblation, a meal-offering, unto Yahweh, of fine meal, shall be his oblation,—and he shall pour out thereon oil, and place thereon, frankincense;

2. so shall he bring it in unto the sons of Aaron, the priests, and he shall grasp therefrom a handful of the fine meal thereof and of the oil thereof, besides all the frankincense thereof,—and the priest shall make a perfume with the memorial thereof at the altar, an altar-flame of a satisfying odour unto Yahweh.

3. But, the remainder of the meal-offering, pertaineth unto Aaron and unto his sons,—most holy, from among the altar-flames of Yahweh.

4. Moreover, when thou wouldst bring near as an oblation of a meal-offering, something baked in an oven, round unleavened cakes of fine meal, overflowed with oil, [shall it be], or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

5. But, if, a meal-offering, on a girdle, be thine oblation, of fine meal, overflowed with oil unleavened, shall it be;

6. parting it into pieces, then shalt thou pour thereon oil,—a meal-offering, it is,

7. But, if a meal-offering of the boiler, be thine oblation, of fine meal with oil, shall it be made.

8. Then shalt thou bring in the meal-offering that is made of these, unto Yahweh,—and one shall bring it near unto the priest, and he shall take it near unto the altar.

9. Then shall the priest uplift out of the meal-offering, a memorial thereof, and make a perfume at the altar,—an altar-flame of a satisfying odour unto Yahweh.

10. But the remainder of the meal-offering pertaineth to Aaron and to his sons,—most holy from among the altar-flames of Yahweh. 

11.  None of the meal-offerings which ye bring near unto Yahweh shall be made into anything leavened,—for, of no leaven and Of no syrup, may ye make a perfume, as an altar-flame unto Yahweh.

12. As for an oblation of first-fruits, ye shall bring them near unto Yahweh,—but unto the altar, they shall not take them up, as a satisfying odour.

13. And, every meal-offering oblation of thine, with salt, shalt thou season, and thou shalt not suffer to be lacking the salt of the covenant of thy God, from upon thy meal-offering,—upon every oblation of thine, shalt thou offer salt.

14. But, if thou wouldst bring near a meal-offering of first-ripe corn, unto Yahweh, of green ears roasted in fire crushed grain of garden-land, shalt thou bring near thy meal-offering of first-ripe corn.

15. And thou shalt place thereon, oil and shalt put thereon, frankincense,—a meal-offering, it is.

16. Then shall the priest make a perfume, with the memorial thereof,—from the crushed grain thereof and from the oil thereof, besides all the frankincense thereof,—an altar-flame, unto Yahweh.  

## Leviticus 3

1. But, if a peace-offering, be his oblation, if, of the herd, he himself, be bringing near,—whether male or female, without defect, shall he bring it near before Yahweh.

2. Then shall he lean his hand upon the head of his oblation, and slay it at the entrance of the tent of meeting,—and the sons of Aaron the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about,

3. Then shall he bring near out of the peace-offering, an altar-flame unto Yahweh,—the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards;

4. and the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins,—and the caul upon the liver, upon the kidneys, shall he remove it.

5. Then shall the sons of Aaron make thereof a perfume at the altar, upon the ascending-sacrifice which is on the wood, which is on the fire,—an altar-flame of a satisfying odour unto Yahweh. 

6.  But, if out of the flock, be his oblation for a peace-offering unto Yahweh, whether male or female—without defect, shall he bring it near.

7. If a young sheep, he himself, be bringing near as his oblation, then shall he bring it near, before Yahweh.

8. And he shall lean his hand upon the head of his oblation, and shall slay it before the tent of meeting,—and the sons of Aaron shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about.

9. Then shall he bring near out of the peace-offering, an altar-flame unto Yahweh, the fat thereof the fat-tail thereof entire close to the backbone, shall he remove it,—and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards;

10. and the two kidneys, with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins,—and the caul that is on the liver, on the kidneys, shall he remove it.

11. Then shall the priest make a perfume, at the altar,—the food of an altar-flame, unto Yahweh.

12. But if a goat, be his oblation, then shall he bring it near, before Yahweh.

13. And he shall lean his hand upon its head, and shall slay it before the tent of meeting,—and the sons of Aaron shall dash its blood against the altar, round about.

14. Then shall he bring near therefrom as his oblation an altar-flame unto Yahweh,—the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards;

15. and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them which is on the loins,—the caul upon the liver, on the kidneys, shall he remove it.

16. Then shall the priest make a perfume at the altar,—the food of an altar-flame for a satisfying odour,—all the fat—unto Yahweh.

17. An age-abiding statute to your generations, in all your dwellings,—none of the fat nor of the blood, shall ye eat.  

## Leviticus 4

1. And Yahweh spake, unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak thou unto the sons of Israel, saying—When any person, shall sin by mistake, departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh, as to things which should not be done, and shall do any one of them,—

3. If, the anointed priest, shall sin, so as to bring guilt upon the people, then shall he bring near for his sin which he hath committed a choice young bullock without defect, unto Yahweh as a sin-bearer.

4. And he shall bring in the bullock unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh,—and shall lean his hand upon the head of the bullock, and shall slay the bullock before Yahweh.

5. And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock,—and bring it into the tent of meeting;

6. and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood,—and sprinkle of the blood seven times, before Yahweh, in front of the veil of the sanctuary.

7. Then shall the priest put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting,—and, all the [remainder of the] blood of the bullock, shall he pour out at the base of the altar of ascending-sacrifice, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting,

8. And all the fat of the sin-bearing bullock, shall he heave up therefrom,—the fat that covereth over the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards;

9. and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them which is upon the loins,—and as for the caul upon the liver, upon the kidneys, shall he remove it:

10. just as it is heaved up from the ox of the peace-offering,—and the priest shall make of them a perfume on the altar of ascending-sacrifice,

11. But, as for the skin of the bullock and all its flesh with its head and with its legs,—and its inwards, and its dung,

12. he shall take forth the entire bullock—unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place unto the outpoured heap of fat-ashes, and shall burn it up on wood in the fire,—upon the outpoured heap of fat-ashes, shall it be burned up. 

13.  And, if the whole assembly of Israel, shall make a mistake, and a matter be hidden from the eyes of the convocation,—and so they do something, whereby they depart from any of the commandments of Yahweh as to things which should not be done, and become guilty;

14. and the sin shall become known, which they have committed therein, then shall the convocation bring near a choice young bullock as a sin-bearer, yea they shall bring it in. before the tent of meeting;

15. and the elders of the assembly shall lean their hands upon the head of the bullock before Yahweh,—and shall slay the bullock, before Yahweh;

16. and the anointed priest shall bring in of the blood of the bullock,—into the tent of meeting;

17. and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood,—and shall sprinkle of the blood seven times before Yahweh, upon the face of the veil;

18. and, some of the blood, shall he put upon the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting; and, all the [remainder of the] blood, shall he pour out at the base of the altar of ascending-sacrifice, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting;

19. and, as for all the fat thereof, he shall heave up therefrom,—and make a perfume at the altar.

20. And he shall do to the bullock, as he did to the [first] sin-bearing bullock, so shall he do with this,—and the priest shall put a propitiatory-covering over them, and it shall be forgiven them.

21. And he shall take forth the bullock unto the outside of the camp, and burn it up, just as he burned up the first bullock,—the sin-bearer of the convocation, it is. 

22.  When a prince, shall sin,—and shall do something, departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh his God as to things which should not be done, by mistake and shall become aware of his guilt;

23. or his sin wherein he hath sinned be made known unto him, then shall he bring in. as his oblation a he-goat a male without defect;

24. and shall lean his hand upon the head of the goat, and shall slay it in the place where they slay the ascending-sacrifice before Yahweh,—a sin-bearer, it is.

25. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-bearer with his finger, and put upon the horns of the altar of ascending-sacrifice; and, the [remainder of the] blood thereof, shall he pour out at the base of the altar of ascending-sacrifice;

26. and with all the fat thereof, shall he make a perfume at the altar, as with the fat of the peace-offering,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him because of his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 

27.  And, if, any person, shall sin, by mistake from among the people of the land,—by his doing anything departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh, as to things which should not be done, and shall become aware of his guilt;

28. or his sin which he hath committed shall be made known unto, him, then shall he bring in, as his oblation, a kid of the goats a female, without defect, for his sin which he hath committed;

29. and shall lean his hand upon the head of the sin-bearer,—and shall slay the sin-bearer in the place of the ascending-sacrifice.

30. Then shall the priest take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put upon the horns of the altar of ascending-sacrifice,—and all the [remaining] blood thereof, shall he pour out, at the base of the altar;

31. and all the fat thereof, shall he remove as the fat from off the peace-offering was removed, and the priest shall make a perfume at the altar, for a satisfying odour unto Yahweh,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, and it shall be forgiven him.

32. And, if a lamb, he bring in. as his oblation for a sin-bearer, a female without defect, shall he bring in;

33. and shall lean his hand upon the head of the sin-bearer,—and shall slay it as a sin-bearer, in the place where they slay the ascending-sacrifice.

34. Then shall the priest take of the blood of the sin-bearer with his finger, and put upon the horns of the altar of ascending-sacrifice,—and all the [remaining] blood thereof, shall he pour out, at the base of the altar;

35. and all the fat thereof, shall he remove as the fat of the lamb is removed, from the peace-offering, and the priest shall make a perfume therewith at the altar, upon the altar-flames of Yahweh,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him on account of his sin which he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.  

## Leviticus 5

1. Any person, moreover, whensoever he shall sin in that, when he heareth a voice of swearing, he himself, being a witness either seeing or knowing,—if he do not tell and so hath to bear his iniquity:—

2. Or, any person, who toucheth anything unclean, whether the carcase of an unclean wild-beast or the carcase of an unclean tame-beast, or the carcase of an unclean creeping thing,—and it is hidden from him, he himself being unclean, and he becometh aware of his guilt:—

3. Or whensoever one shall touch the uncleanness of man, as regardeth any uncleanness of his, wherewith one may become unclean,—and it be hidden from him, and then he himself, getting to know it becometh aware of his guilt:—

4. Or, any person, whensoever he shall swear, speaking unadvisedly with the lips, to harm or to help, as regardeth anything wherein the son of earth may speak unadvisedly by way of oath, and it be hidden from him,—and then, he himself, getting to know it, becometh aware of his guilt as regardeth any one of these things.

5. Then shall it be, when he becometh aware of his guilt, as regardeth any one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned;

6. and shall bring in as his guilt-bearer unto Yahweh for his sin which he hath committed, a female from the flock—a lamb or a kid of the goats—as a sin-bearer,—so shall the priest put propitiatory-covering over him, because of his sin. 

7.  And, if his hand cannot reach sufficient for a lamb, then shall he bring in to bear his guilt—for that he hath sinned—two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons unto Yahweh,—one for a sin-bearer, and one for an ascending-sacrifice.

8. And he shall take them in unto the priest, who shall bring near that which is for a sin-bearer first,—and shall nip through the neck close to the head but shall not divide it asunder.

9. And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-bearer upon the wall of the altar, and the remainder of the blood, shall he drain out at the base of the altar,—a, sin-bearer, it is.

10. And of the second, shall he make an ascending-sacrifice according to the regulation,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, because of his sin which he hath committed and it shall be forgiven him.

11. But if his hand cannot lay hold of two turtledove, or two young pigeons, then shall he bring in as his oblation—because he hath sinned—the tenth of an ephah of fine meal for bearing sin,—he shall not put thereon oil, neither shall he lay thereon frankincense, for a sin-bearer, it is.

12. And he shall bring it in unto the priest, and the priest shall take therefrom a handful, as the memorial thereof, and shall make a perfume at the altar, upon the altar-flames of Yahweh,—a sin-bearer, it is.

13. So shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, on account of his sin which he hath committed, departing from some one of these things, and it shall be forgiven him,—then shall it be the priest’s, like the meal-offering. 

14.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—

15. Whensoever, any person, shall commit a trespass, and shall take away by mistake, from the holy things of Yahweh, then shall he bring in as his guilt-bearer unto Yahweh, a ram without defect out of the flock, with thine estimate in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt-bearer:

16. that, moreover, which he took away from the sanctuary, shall he make good and the fifth part thereof, shall he add thereunto, and shall give it to the priest,—and, the priest, shall put a propitiatory-covering over him with the guilt-bearing ram and it shall be forgiven him.

17. And if any person when he shall sin, and do something, departing from any of the commandments of Yahweh, as to things which should not be done,—though he knew it not, shall so become guilty, and shall bear his iniquity,

18. then shall he bring in a ram without defect out of the flock by thine estimate as a guilt-bearer unto the priest,—and the priest shall put a propitiatory-covering over him, on account of his mistake which he made though he knew it not and it shall be forgiven him:

19. a guilt-bearer, it is,—he was, verily guilty against Yahweh.  

## Leviticus 6

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—

2. When any person, shall sin, and shall commit a trespass against Yahweh,—and shall withhold something of the truth from his neighbour in respect of a deposit, or a pledge or anything plundered, or shall use extortion with his neighbour;

3. or shall find something lost and shall withhold something of the truth therein, and shall swear to a falsehood,—as regardeth a single thing of all that a son of earth may do, to commit sin thereby;

4. and so it shall come about that he shall commit sin and then become aware of his guilt, then shall he return the plunder which he had plundered, or the extortion which he had extorted, or the deposit that was deposited with him,—or the lost thing which he hath found:

5. or in anything as to which he hath been swearing to a falsehood, then shall he make it good in the principal thereof, and the fifth part thereof, shall he add thereunto,—to whomsoever it belongeth, to him, shall he give it in the day he becometh aware of his guilt;

6. but, his guilt-bearer, itself, shall he bring in unto Yahweh,—a ram without defect out of the flock by thine estimate as a guilt-bearer, unto the priest.

7. So shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him before Yahweh, and it shall be forgiven him,—on account of any one thing, of all which one might do, so as to become guilty therein. 

8.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:

9. Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the ascending-sacrifice,—the same, is the ascending-sacrifice, which is upon the hearth, upon the altar, all the night until the morning,—and the fire of the altar, shall be kept burning therein.

10. So then the priest shall put on his upper garment of linen, and, breeches of linen, shall he put on over his flesh, then shall he take up the fat-ashes, whereto the fire consumeth the ascending-sacrifice on the altar,—and shall put them beside the altar.

11. Then shall he put off his garments, and put on other garments,—and shall carry forth the fat-ashes unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place,

12. And, the fire on the altar, shall be kept burning therein, it shall not be suffered to go out, but the priest shall kindle up thereon pieces of wood, morning by morning,—and shall set in order thereupon the ascending-sacrifice, and shall make a perfume thereon with the fat-pieces of the peace-offerings:

13. fire, shall continually be kept burning on the altar, it shall not be suffered to go out. 

14.  And, this, is the law of the meal-offering,—the sons of Aaron shall bring it near before Yahweh, unto the front of the altar.

15. Then shall one lift up therefrom a handful of the fine meal of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering,—and shall make a perfume at the altar, an altar-flame of a satisfying odour, shall the memorial thereof be, unto Yahweh.

16. And the remainder thereof, shall Aaron and his sons eat,—as unleavened cakes, shall it be eaten, in a holy place, within the court of the tent of meeting, shall they eat it.

17. It shall not be baked into anything leavened, as their portion, have I given it, from among the altar-flames of Yahweh,—most holy, it is, like the sin-bearer, and like the guilt-bearer,

18. Any male among the sons of Aaron may eat it, an age-abiding statute to your generations from among the altar-flames of Yahweh,—every one that toucheth them shall be hallowed.

19. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—

20. This, is the oblation of Aaron and his sons, which they shall bring near unto Yahweh in the day when he is anointed, The tenth of an ephah of fine meal, as a continual meal-offering,—half thereof in the morning, and half thereof in the evening;

21. on a pan, with oil, shall it be made when well mingled, shalt thou bring it in,—in baked portions, as a meal-offering in pieces, shalt thou bring it near as a satisfying odour unto Yahweh.

22. And the priest that is anointed in his stead from among his sons, shall prepare it,—[it is] an age-abiding statute, that unto Yahweh, shall a perfume, of the entire gift, be made:

23. yea, every meal-offering of a priest, shall be, entire—it shall not be eaten. 

24.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—

25. Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, This, is the law of the sin-bearer. In the place where the ascending-sacrifice is slain, shall the sin-bearer be slain, before Yahweh, most holy, it is.

26. The priest who maketh it a sin-bearer, shall eat it,—in a holy place, shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.

27. Every one who toucheth the flesh thereof, shall be hallowed; and when one sprinkleth some of the blood thereof upon a garment, that whereon it was sprinkled, shalt thou wash in a holy place.

28. But, the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled, shall be broken,—or, if, in a vessel of bronze, it hath been boiled, then shall the vessel be scoured and rinsed in water.

29. Any male among the priests may eat thereof,—most holy, it is.

30. But, no sin-bearer whereof any of the blood is taken into the tent of meeting to make a propitiatory-covering in the sanctuary, shall be eaten,—with fire, shall it be consumed.  

## Leviticus 7

1. And this, is the law of the guilt-bearer,—most holy, it is!

2. In the place where they slay the ascending-sacrifice, shall they slay the guilt-bearer; and, the blood thereof, shall one dash against the altar, round about;

3. and, as for all the fat thereof, one shall bring near therefrom,—the fat-tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards;

4. and the two kidneys, with the fat that is upon them, which is upon the loins,—and the caul upon the liver, up to the kidneys, shall he remove it.

5. And the priest shall make a perfume with them at the altar, an altar-flame unto Yahweh—a guilt-bearer, it is,

6. Any male among the priests, may eat thereof,—in a holy place, shall it be eaten, most holy, it is.

7. As the sin-bearer, so the guilt-bearer,—one law, for them,—the priest who maketh a propitiatory-covering, therewith,—to him, shall it belong,

8. And, as for the priest who bringeth near the ascending-sacrifice of any man, the skin of the ascending-sacrifice which he hath brought near, to the priest himself, shall it belong.

9. And as for any meal-offering that may be baked in an oven, or anything that hath been prepared in a boiler or on a girdle, to the priest that bringeth it near—to him, shall it belong,

10. And, as for any meal-offering overflowed with oil or dry,—to all the sons of Aaron, shall it belong, to one as much as to another. 

11.  And, this, is the law of the peace-offering which one may bring near unto Yahweh.

12. If, for thanksgiving, he bring it near, then shall he bring near, with the thanksgiving sacrifice perforated cakes unleavened, overflowed with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil,—and of fine flour moistened, perforated cakes overflowed with oil.

13. With perforated cakes of leavened bread, shall he bring near his oblation, with his peace-offering of thanksgiving,

14. Then shall he bring near therefrom one of each oblation, a heave-offering unto Yahweh,—to the priest who dasheth [against the altar] the blood of the peace-offering—to him, shall it belong.

15. But, as for the flesh of his peace-offering of thanksgiving, on the day of bringing it near, shall it be eaten,—he shall not leave thereof until morning,

16. But, if, a vow or a freewill offering, be his sacrifice of oblation, in the day he bringeth near his sacrifice, shall it be eaten, and on the morrow, then may the remainder thereof, be eaten;

17. but as for the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice, on the third day—in fire, shall it be consumed.

18. And, if any of the flesh of his peace-offering, be at all eaten, on the third day, he that brought it near [shall not be accepted] it shall not be reckoned to him, unclean, shall it be,—and the person who shall eat thereof, shall bear his iniquity.

19. And, the flesh that toucheth anything unclean, shall not be eaten, in fire, shall it be consumed,—but, as for the [other] flesh, any one who is clean, may eat flesh.

20. But as for the person who shall eat flesh from the peace-offering, which pertaineth unto Yahweh, while his uncleanness is on him, then shall that person be cut off from among his kinsfolk.

21. Yea, as for, any person, whensoever he shall touch anything unclean—the uncleanness of man or an unclean beast, or any unclean disgusting thing,—and then eateth of the flesh of a peace-offering that pertaineth unto Yahweh, then shall that person be cut off from among his kinsfolk.

22. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—

23. Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying,—No fat, of ox or sheep or goat, shall ye eat:

24. and though the fat of what dieth of itself and the fat of that which has been torn in pieces, may be used for any other service, yet shall ye, in nowise eat it.

25. Nay, as touching any one who eateth the fat of any beast, wherefrom he might bring near an altar-flame unto Yahweh, then shall the person that eateth be cut off from among his kinsfolk.

26. And no manner of blood, shall ye eat, in any of your dwellings,—whether of bird or of beast:

27. as touching any person who eateth any manner of blood, then shall that person be cut off from among his kinsfolk.

28. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying,

29. Speak unto the sons of Israel saying,—He that offereth his peace-offering unto Yahweh, shall bring in his own oblation unto Yahweh out of his peace-offering:

30. his own hands shall bring in the altar-flames of Yahweh,—the fat with the breast, he shall bring it in, the breast, to wave it as a wave-offering before Yahweh.

31. Then shall the priest make a perfume with the fat at the altar,—and the breast shall be for Aaron and for his sons.

32. But, the right shoulder, shall ye give as a heave-offering, unto the priest,—from among your peace-offerings

33. he that bringeth near the blood of the peace-offerings and the fat from among the sons of Aaron, to him, shall belong the right shoulder for a portion.

34. For, the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder, have I taken of the sons of Israel, out of their peace-offerings,—and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as an age-abiding statute, from the sons of Israel. 

35.  This, is what pertaineth to the anointing of Aaron and to the anointing of his sons out of the altar-flames of Yahweh,—[granted] in the day when he brought them near, to minister as priests unto Yahweh:

36. which Yahweh commanded to give them in the day when he anointed them, from among the sons of Israel,—an age-abiding statute to their generations.

37. This is the law—for the ascending-sacrifice, for the meal-offering, and for the sin-bearer, and for the guilt-bearer,—and for the installation-offerings, and for the peace-offering:

38. which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai,—in the day when he commanded the sons of Israel to bring near their oblations unto Yahweh in the desert of Sinai.  

## Leviticus 8

1. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

2. Take thou Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil,—and the sin-bearing bullock, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened cakes;

3. and all the assembly, call thou together,—unto the entrance of the tent of meeting.

4. And Moses did, as Yahweh commanded him,—and the assembly was called together, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting.

5. Then said Moses unto the assembly,—This is the thing, which Yahweh hath commanded to be done.

6. So Moses brought near Aaron and his sons,—and bathed them with water,

7. and put upon him the tunic and girded him with the band, and clothed him with the robe, and put upon him the ephod, and girded him with the curiously-woven band of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith;

8. and he put upon him the breastpiece,—and placed, in the breastpiece, the Lights and the Perfections;

9. and he put the turban upon his head,—and put upon the turban, on the forefront thereof the burnished plate of gold—the holy crown, As Yahweh commanded Moses.

10. And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the habitation and all that was therein,—and hallowed them;

11. and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times,—and anointed the altar, and all the utensils thereof and the laver and its stand to hallow them

12. and he poured of the anointing oil, upon the head of Aaron,—and anointed him, to hallow him.

13. And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron and clothed them with tunics and girded them with bands, and wrapped round for them turbans,—As Yahweh commanded Moses. 

14.  Then was led near the sin-bearing bullock,—and Aaron and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the sin-bearing bullock,

15. Then was it slain, and Moses took the blood and put [thereof] upon the horns of the altar round about, with his finger, and cleansed the altar from sin,—and the [remainder of the] blood, poured he forth at the base of the altar, and hallowed it putting a propitiatory-covering thereupon.

16. And he took all the fat that was on the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat,—and Moses made a perfume at the altar.

17. But the bullock itself, and its skin and its flesh and its dung, consumed he with fire, outside the camp,—As Yahweh commanded Moses,

18. Then was brought near the ram for the ascending-sacrifice,—and Aaron and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the ram;

19. and it was slain,—and Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about;

20. and the ram itself, was cut up into its pieces,—and Moses made a perfume with the head and with the pieces and with the fat;

21. but the inwards and the legs, were bathed in water,—and Moses made a perfume with the whole ram at the altar, an ascending-sacrifice, it was—for a satisfying odour an altar-flame, it was unto Yahweh, As Yahweh commanded Moses.

22. Then was brought near the second ram, the ram of installation, and Aaron and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the ram;

23. and it was slain, and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear,—and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

24. Then were brought near the sons of Aaron, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot,—and Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about.

25. And he took the fat and the fat-tail, and all the fat that was on the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat,—and the right shoulder;

26. and out of the basket of unleavened-cakes that was before Yahweh, took he one round unleavened-cake and one round oil-cake, and one wafer, and put them upon the fat portions, and upon the right shoulder;

27. and placed the whole upon the opened palms of Aaron, and upon the opened palms of his sons,—and waved them as a wave-offering, before Yahweh.

28. And Moses took them from off their opened palms, and made a perfume at the altar upon the ascending-sacrifice,—an installation, they were for a satisfying odour, an altar-flame, it was unto Yahweh.

29. And Moses took the breast, and waved it as a wave-offering, before Yahweh,—of the ram of installation, unto Moses it belonged, as a portion, As Yahweh commanded Moses.

30. And Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood that was upon the altar, and sprinkled upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons and upon the garments of his sons with him,—and hallowed Aaron, his garments, and his sons and the garments of his sons with him. 

31.  And Moses said unto Aaron and unto his sons Boil ye the flesh, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there, shall ye eat it, and the bread which is in the basket of installation,—as I have been commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons, shall eat it.

32. But, that which is left of the flesh, and of the bread, with fire, shall ye consume.

33. And from the entrance of the tent of meeting, shall ye not go forth for seven days, until the day that filleth up the days of your installation,—because for seven days, will he install you:

34. as hath been done this day, [so] hath Yahweh commanded to be done, to put a propitiatory-covering over you.

35. Even at the entrance of the tent of meeting, shall ye abide day and night for seven days, and shall keep the watch of Yahweh and shall not die,—for, so, am I commanded.

36. And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh had commanded through the mediation of Moses.  

## Leviticus 9

1. And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called for Aaron, and for his sons,—and for the elders of Israel;

2. and said unto Aaron—Take for thyself a choice calf, as a sin-bearer, and a ram for an ascending-sacrifice, each without defect,—and bring them near before Yahweh;

3. and unto the sons of Israel, shalt thou speak, saying,—Take ye a he-goat, as a sin-bearer, and a calf and a young sheep, each a year old, without defect for an ascending-sacrifice;

4. and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh, and a meal-offering overflowed with oil,—for, to-day, doth, Yahweh, appear unto you.

5. So they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting,—and all the assembly drew near, and stood before Yahweh.

6. And Moses said—This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded that ye shall do,—that the glory of Yahweh may appear unto you.

7. and Moses said unto Aaron—Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-bearer and thine ascending-sacrifice, and put a propitiatory-covering about thyself and about the people,—and offer the oblation of the people and put a propitiatory-covering about them, As Yahweh hath commanded. 

8.  So Aaron drew near unto the altar,—and slew the sin-bearing calf which was for himself;

9. and the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [thereof] upon the horns of the altar,—and the [remainder of the] blood, poured he out at the base of the altar;

10. and with the fat and the kidneys and the caul a from the liver, of the sin-bearer, made he a perfume at the altar,—As Yahweh commanded Moses.

11. But, the flesh and the skin, consumed he with fire, outside the camp.

12. Then slew he the ascending-sacrifice,—and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about.

13. And the ascending-sacrifice, presented they unto him piece by piece thereof also the head,—and he made a perfume upon the altar:

14. and he bathed the inwards and the legs,—and made a perfume upon the ascending-sacrifice at the altar.

15. Then brought he near the oblation of the people,—and took the sin-bearing goat which pertained to the people, and slew it and made therewith a sin-bearer, like the first.

16. Then brought he near the ascending-sacrifice,—and offered it, according to the regulation,

17. Then brought he near the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and made a perfume upon the altar,—in addition to the ascending-sacrifice of the morning.

18. Then slew he the ox, and the ram, as a peace-offering, which pertained unto the people,—and the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him, and he dashed it against the altar, round about;

19. and the portions of fat from the ox,—and from the ram, the fat-tail, and the covering, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver;

20. and they put the portions of fat upon the breasts,—and he made a perfume with the fat at the altar;

21. but the breasts and the right shoulder, did Aaron wave as a wave-offering, before Yahweh,—as Moses commanded,

22. Then Aaron lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them,—and he came down from offering the sin-bearer, and the ascending-sacrifice and the peace-offering. 

23.  And when Moses and Aaron had entered into the tent of meeting,—and had come forth, and blessed the people, then appeared the glory of Yahweh, unto all the people;

24. yea, there came forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed upon the altar, the ascending-sacrifice and the portions of fat,—and all the people beheld and shouted, and fell down upon their faces.  

## Leviticus 10

1. Then Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, took each man his censer and placed therein fire, and put thereon incense,—and brought near before Yahweh strange fire, which he had not commanded them.

2. Then came there forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed them,—and they died before Yahweh. 

3.  Then said Moses unto Aaron—The very thing, that Yahweh spake, saying—In them that draw near to me, must I be hallowed, And before the faces of all the people, must I get myself honour,—And Aaron, was dumb.

4. Then called Moses unto Mishael, and unto Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, uncle of Aaron,—and said unto them—Draw near bear away your brethren from before the sanctuary, unto the outside of the camp.

5. So they drew near and bare them away, in their tunics, unto the outside of the camp,—as spake Moses.

6. Then said Moses unto Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons—Your heads, ye may not bare and your garments, ye shall not rend so shall ye not die, neither against all the assembly, will he be wroth,—but let, your brethren the whole house of Israel, bewail the consuming fire wherewith Yahweh hath consumed.

7. But, from the entrance of the tent of meeting, shall ye not go forth, lest ye die, for, the anointing oil of Yahweh is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses. 

8.  Then spake Yahweh unto Aaron, saying:

9. Wine and strong drink, thou mayest not drink,—thou nor thy sons with thee when ye enter into the tent of meeting, so shall ye not die,—an age-abiding statute to your generations;

10. That ye may make a difference, between the sacred and the common,—and between the unclean and the clean;

11. And may teach the sons of Israel,—all the statutes which Yahweh hath spoken unto them, by the mediation of Moses. 

12.  Then spake Moses unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar his sons that were left, Take ye the meal-offering that is left of the altar-flames of Yahweh, and eat it unleavened beside the altar,—for, most holy, it is;

13. therefore shall ye eat it in a holy place, for, thine by statute, and thy sons’ by statute, it is, from among the altar-flames of Yahweh,—for, so, am I commanded.

14. And the wave-breast, and the heave-shoulder, shall ye eat in clean place, thou, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee,—for as thine by statute and thy sons’ by statute, have they been given, from among the peace-offerings of the sons of Israel.

15. The heave-shoulder and the wave-breast upon the altar-flames of the fat portions, shall they bring in, to wave as a wave-offering, before Yahweh,—so shall they be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by an age-abiding statute, As Yahweh hath commanded.

16. Now, as for the sin-bearing goat, Moses diligently sought it but lo! it had been burnt up,—then was he wroth against Eleazar and against Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying:

17. Wherefore did ye not eat the sin-bearer in the holy place? for most, holy, it is,—and thee same, hath he given you that ye may bear the iniquity of the assembly, to put a propitiatory-covering over them before Yahweh.

18. Lo! the blood thereof had not been taken into the holy place, within,—ye should have, indeed eaten, it, in a holy place, as I commanded.

19. Then spake Aaron unto Moses—Lo! this very day, when they had brought near their own sin-bearer, and their own ascending-sacrifice, there befell me such things as these,—if, then, I had eaten of the sin-bearer this day, would it have been well-pleasing in the eyes of Yahweh?

20. And, when Moses heard that, then was it well-pleasing in his eyes.  

## Leviticus 11

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying unto them:

2. Speak ye unto the sons of Israel saying,—These are the living things which ye may eat, of all the beasts which are upon the earth:

3. Whatsoever parteth the hoof and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud among beasts, that, may ye eat.

4. Nevertheless, these, shall ye not eat, of them that chew the cud, and of them that part the hoof,—the camel, because though he, cheweth the cud, yet, the hoof, he parteth not, unclean, he is to you;

5. And, the coney, because, though he cheweth the cud, yet, the hoof, he parteth not,—unclean, he is to you;

6. And the hare, because though she cheweth the cud, yet the hoof, she parteth not,—unclean, she is to you;

7. And, the swine, because though he parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, yet, the cud, he cheweth not,—unclean, he is to you;

8. Of their flesh, shall ye not eat, and, their carcase, shall ye not touch,—unclean, they are to you. 

9.  these, may ye eat, of all that are in the waters,—all that have fins and scales in the waters, in the seas and in the rivers, them, may ye eat.

10. But, all that have not fins and scales, in the seas and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of all the living souls that are in the waters, an abomination, they are unto you;

11. and an abomination, shall they remain to you,—of their flesh, ye shall not eat, and their carcases, shall ye abhor.

12. Whatsoever hath not fins and scales in the waters, an abomination, it is unto you.

13. And, these, shall ye abhor of birds, they shall not be eaten, an abomination, they are,—the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the osprey;

14. and the vulture, and the falcon, after its kind;

15. every raven, after its kind;

16. and the female ostrich, and the male ostrich, and the sea-gull,—and the hawk after its kind;

17. and the pelican and the gannet, and the bittern;

18. and the swan and the vomiting pelican and the little vulture;

19. and the stork, and the parrot, after its kind,—and the mountain-cock and the bat. 

20.  Every creeping thing that flieth, that goeth on all-fours, an abomination, it is unto you.

21. Nevertheless, these, may ye eat, of all creeping things that fly, that go on all-fours,—such as have legs above their feet, to leap therewith, upon the earth—

22. these of them, may ye eat: the swarming-locust after its kind, and the devouring locust after its kind,—and the chargol-locust after its kind, and the chagab-locust after its kind.

23. But every [other] creeping thing that flieth, which hath four feet, an abomination, it is unto you;

24. and, for these, shall ye count yourselves unclean—whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the evening;

25. and whosoever beareth away aught of the carcase of them, shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.

26. As for every kind of beast which, though it parteth the hoof, yet is not cloven-footed nor cheweth the cud, unclean, they are unto you,—every one who toucheth them shall be unclean.

27. And, all that go upon their paws, among all the living things that go on all-fours, unclean, they are unto you,—whoso toucheth the carcase of them, shall be unclean until the evening.

28. And, he that beareth away the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until the evening,—unclean, they are unto you.

29. And, these, unto you, shall be unclean, among the creeping things that creep upon the earth,—the weasel and the mouse, and the lizard after its kind;

30. and the ferret and the chameleon and the wall-lizard,—and the winding lizard, and the mole.

31. These, are they which are unclean to you among all that creep,—whosoever toucheth them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening;

32. and, everything whereon any of them shall fall when they are dead shall be unclean—of any articles of wood, or cloth, or skin, or sackcloth, any article wherewith any work is done,—shall be put in water and shall be unclean until the evening, and then be clean,

33. And, as for any earthen vessel whereinto any of them may fall, everything therein shall be unclean, and, the vessel itself, shall ye break in pieces.

34. Of all the food that may be eaten, that whereon shall come water, shall be unclean,—and, all drink which might be drunk in any [such] vessel, shall be unclean.

35. And, everything whereon shall fall any part of the carcase of them shall be unclean, oven or fire-range, it shall be destroyed, unclean, they are,—and, unclean, Shall they remain to you.

36. Notwithstanding, a fountain or cistern wherein is a gathering of waters shall be clean,—but, he that toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean.

37. And when any part of the carcase of them shall fall upon seed for sowing, which is to be sown, the same is, clean.

38. But, when water shall be put upon seed, and there shall fall thereon any part of the carcase of them, unclean, it is to you.

39. And, when any of the beasts which are yours for food shall die, he that toucheth the carcase of it shall be unclean until the evening.

40. And, he that eateth of the carcase of it, shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening,—he also that carrieth away the carcase thereof shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.

41. And, any creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, an abomination, it is—it shall not be eaten.

42. Everything that goeth upon the belly, and everything that goeth upon all-fours, even to everything having many feet, as regardeth any creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, ye shall not eat them for, an abomination, they are. 

43.  Do not make your persons abominable, with any creeping thing that creepeth,—neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should become unclean thereby.

44. For, I—Yahweh, am your God, therefore shall ye hallow yourselves and remain holy; for, holy, am, I,—therefore shall ye not make your persons unclean, with any creeping thing that crawleth upon the earth;

45. for, I—Yahweh, am he that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, that I might become your God,—therefore shall ye be holy, for, holy, am, I.

46. This, is the law of beast and of bird, and of every living soul that moveth in the waters,—and as to every soul that creepeth upon the earth:

47. That ye may make a difference—between the unclean and the clean,—and between the living thing that may be eaten, and the living thing which may not be eaten.  

## Leviticus 12

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, A woman when she conceiveth seed and giveth birth to a male child, then shall she be unclean seven days, according to the days of her removal in her sickness shall she be unclean.

3. And, on the eighth day, shall the flesh of his foreskin be circumcised.

4. And, for thirty-three days, shall she continue in the blood of purification,—no hallowed thing, shall she touch, and, into the sanctuary, shall she not enter, until her days of purification are fulfilled.

5. But if, a female child, she bear, then shall she be unclean two weeks as in her removal,—and, for sixty-six days, shall she continue in the blood of purification. 

6.  And, when the days of her purification are fulfilled, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring in a lamb, the choice of its year, as an ascending-sacrifice, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove, as a sin-bearer, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, unto the priest;

7. and he shall bring it near before Yahweh so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over her, and she shall be clean from her fountain of blood. This, is the law for her that hath given birth, to a male child or to a female.

8. But, if her hand findeth not sufficiency for a lamb, then shall she take two turtle doves or two young pigeons, one for an ascending-sacrifice and one for a sin-bearer,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over her, and she shall be clean.  

## Leviticus 13

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying—

2. When, any man, shall have—in the skin of his flesh—a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it shall become in the skin of his flesh the plague-spot of leprosy, then shall he be brought in unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests;

3. and the priest shall view the spot in the skin of his flesh—if, the hair in the plague, have turned white and the appearance of the spot be deeper than the skin of his flesh, the plague-spot of leprosy, it is,—so the priest shall view him and pronounce him unclean.

4. But, if the bright spot, though white in the skin of his flesh, is not deeper in appearance than the skin, and, the hair, hath not turned white, then shall the priest shut up the plagued one, seven days.

5. And the priest shall view him on the seventh day, and lo! if the spot hath stayed to his sight, and the spot hath not spread in the skin, then shall the priest shut him up seven days more,

6. Then shall the priest view him on the seventh day, a second time, and lo! if the spot is, faint, and the spot hath not spread in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him clean—it is, a scab, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

7. But if the scab shall have, verily spread, in the skin, since he was shown to the priest that he might be cleansed, then shall he shew himself again unto the priest;

8. and the priest shall take a view, and lo! if the scab hath spread in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean—leprosy, it is.

9. When, the plague of leprosy, cometh to be in any human being, then shall he be brought in unto the priest;

10. and the priest shall take a view, and lo! if there is a white rising in the skin and, the same, hath turned the hair white,—and there be a wound of raw flesh in the rising,

11. an old leprosy, it is in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,—he shall not shut him up, for unclean, he is.

12. But, if the leprosy, cometh quite out, in the skin, and the leprosy covereth all the skin of him that, is plagued, from his head even unto his feet,—so far as appeareth to the eyes of the priest,

13. then shall the priest takes view and lo! if the leprosy hath covered all his flesh, then shall he pronounce clean him that was plagued,—all of it, hath turned white, clean, he is.

14. But, the very day there appeareth in him raw flesh, he shall be unclean;

15. so then the priest shall view the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean,—as for the raw flesh, unclean, it is, leprosy, it is.

16. Or, if the raw flesh turn again and be changed to white, then shall he come in unto the priest;

17. and the priest shall view him, and lo! if the spot hath changed to white, then shall the priest pronounce clean him that was plagued—clean, he is. 

18.  And, when, any one’s flesh, hath, in the skin thereof, a boil,—and then it is healed;

19. but in the place of the boil, is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish white, then shall it be shown unto the priest.

20. And the priest shall take a view and lo! if the appearance thereof, is lower than the skin, and, the hair thereof, hath turned white, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean—the plague-spot of leprosy, it, is, in the boil, broken out.

21. But, if the priest shall view it and lo! there is no white hair therein, and it is not deeper than the skin, and, in itself, is faint, then shall the priest shut him up seven days;

22. and, if it, clearly spreadeth, in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean—a plague-spot, it is.

23. But if in its place the bright spot stayeth hath not spread, a boil, it is,—and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

24. Or, when, any one’s flesh, hath in the skin thereof a fiery burning,—and the burning wound becometh a bright spot reddish white, or white,

25. then shall the priest view it—and lo! if the hair is turned white in the bright spot and the appearance thereof is deeper than the skin, leprosy, it is, broken out, in the burning,—so the priest shall pronounce him unclean, the plague-spot of leprosy, it is.

26. But, if the priest shall view it and lo! there is not, in the bright spot white hair, and it is not deeper than the skin but, itself, is faint, then shall the priest shut him up seven days;

27. and the priest shall view him on the seventh day,—if it, hath plainly spread in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean, the plague-spot of leprosy, it is.

28. But, if, in its place the bright spot hath stayed, and hath not spread in the skin, but, itself, is faint, the rising of a burning, it is,—and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for only the inflaming of the burning, it is.

29. And, when there cometh to be in, any man or woman, a spot,—in the head or in the beard,

30. then shall the priest view the spot and lo! if, the appearance thereof, is deeper than the skin, and, therein, is yellow, thin hair, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean a scall, it is, a leprosy of the head or of the beard, it is.

31. But when the priest vieweth the spot, and lo! there is, no appearance, of it deeper than the skin, and, no dark hair, is therein, then shall the priest shut up him that hath the plague-spot of scall, seven days;

32. and the priest shall view the spot on the seventh day, and lo! if the scall hath not spread, and there hath not come to be therein yellow hair,—and, the appearance of the scall, is not deeper than the skin,

33. then shall he shave himself, but the scall, shall he not shave, and the priest shall shut up him who hath the scall seven days, more;

34. then shall the priest view the scall, on the seventh day, and lo! if the scall hath not spread in the skin, and, the appearance thereof, is not deeper than the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him clean, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

35. But, if the scall do indeed spread in the skin,—after he hath been pronounced clean,

36. then shall the priest take a view, and lo! if the scall hath spread in the skin, the priest shall not search for the yellow hair—unclean, he is.

37. But, if in his eyes, the scall is at a stay, and dark hair hath grown up therein, the scall is healed, clean, he is,—and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 

38.  And when either, man or woman, hath in the skin of their flesh bright spots,—bright spots that are white,

39. then shall the priest take a view and lo! if, in the skin of their flesh, are bright spots that are dull white, dead white spot, it is, that hath broken through in the skin—clean, he is.

40. And, when, any man’s, head loseth its hair, though, bald, he is, clean.

41. And if, in front, his head loseth its hair, though bald in the forehead, he is, clean.

42. But, should there be, in the baldness behind, or in the baldness in front, a spot that is reddish white, leprosy broken out, it is, in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front.

43. So the priest shall view it, and lo! if, the rising-spot, be reddish white in his baldness behind or in his baldness in front,—like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh,

44. a leprous man, is he, unclean, he is,—unclean, shall the priest pronounce him in his head, is his plague.

45. Now, as for the leper in whom is the plague, His clothes, shall be rent, And, his head, shall be bare, And, his beard, shall he cover,—And, Unclean! Unclean! shall he cry.

46. All the days that the plague is in him, shall he continue unclean, Unclean, he is,—Alone, shall he remain, Outside the camp, shall be his dwelling. 

47.  And, when, in a garment, there is a plague-spot of leprosy,—whether in a garment of wool, or a garment of flax;

48. either in warp or in weft, made with flax, or with wool,—or in a skin, or in anything wrought of skin;

49. and the spot cometh to be of a greenish yellow or reddish, in the garment or in the skin, whether in warp or in weft, or in any utensil of skin, the plague-spot of leprosy, it is,—and shall be shown unto the priest;

50. and the priest shall view the spot,—and shall shut up him that is plagued seven days;

51. then shall he view the spot, on the seventh day if the spot hath spread in the garment whether in warp or in weft, or in the skin, or anything which may be made of skin for service, the spot is a fretting leprosy, unclean, it is.

52. Then shall he burn up the garment whether it be in the warp or the weft in wool or in flax, or any utensil of skin, wherein shall be the plague-spot,—for, a fretting leprosy, it is, in fire, shall it be burnt up.

53. But if the priest shall take a view, and lo! the spot has not spread, in the garment, either in warp or in weft,—or in any utensil of skin,

54. then shall the priest give command, and they shall wash that wherein is the spot,—and he shall shut it up seven days more;

55. then shall the priest take a view after the plagued garment hath been washed and lo! if the spot hath not changed its look, then though the spot hath not spread, yet unclean, it is, in the fire, shalt thou burn it up,—a sunken spot, it is, in the back thereof, or in the front thereof.

56. And, if the priest hath taken a view, and lo! the spot is, faint, since it hath been washed, then shall he rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, whether out of the warp or out of the weft;

57. and, if it appear still in the garment—either in the warp or in the weft, or in any utensil of skin, a breaking out, it is,—in the fire, shalt thou burn up that wherein is the plague.

58. But, as for the garment—whether the warp or the weft or any utensil of skin which thou shalt wash, and the plague shall depart therefrom, then shall it be washed a second time, and shall be clean.

59. This, is the law as to the plague-spot of leprosy, in a garment of wool or of flax, whether in the warp or the weft, or in any utensil of skin,—To pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.  

## Leviticus 14

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying—

2. This, shall be the law of the leper, in the day when he is declared clean,—he shall be brought in unto the priest;

3. then shall the priest go forth unto the outside of the camp,—and the priest shall take a view, and lo! if the plague of leprosy hath been healed out of the leper,;

4. then shall the priest give command,—and there shall be taken—for him that is to be cleansed—two living clean birds,—and cedar wood, and crimson am hyssop;

5. and the priest shall give command, and one bird shall be slain,—within an earthen vessel over living water:

6. as for the living bird, he shall take, it, and the cedar wood and the crimson, and the hyssop,—and shall dip them and the living bird, in the blood of the bird that hath been slain over the living water;

7. and shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy, seven times,—and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird over the face of the field.

8. And he that is to be declared clean shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair, and bathe in water, and be clean, and, afterwards, shall he come into the camp,—and dwell outside his tent, seven days;

9. and it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all the hair of his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair, shall he shave off,—and shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water so shall he be clean. 

10.  And, on the eighth day, he shall take two he-lambs, without defect, and one ewe-lamb, the choice of its year without defect,—and three-tenths of fine meal for a meal-offering, overflowed with oil, and one log of oil.

11. And the priest that is cleansing him shall cause the man that is to be cleansed, and those things to stand before Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting.

12. And the priest shall take one he-lamb, and bring him near as a guilt-bearer and the log of oil,—and shall wave them as a wave-offering, before Yahweh;

13. and shall slay the lamb in the place where the sin-bearer and the ascending-sacrifice are slain, in the holy place,—for like the sin-bearer, the guilt-bearer, is the priest’s, most holy, it is.

14. Then shall the priest take of the blood of the guilt-bearer, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed,—and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot;

15. and the priest shall take of the log of oil,—and shall pour it upon the palm of the priest’s left hand,

16. and the priest shall dip his right finger [and take] of the oil that is on the palm of his left hand,—and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Yahweh:

17. and of the remainder of the oil which is on the palm of his hand, shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot,—upon the blood of the guilt-bearer;

18. and that which remaineth of the oil that is on the palm of the priest’s hand, he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, before Yahweh.

19. Then shall the priest offer the sin-bearer, and shall put a propitiatory-covering over him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness,—and, afterwards, shall he slay the ascending-sacrifice.

20. And the priest shall cause the ascending-sacrifice, and the meal-offering to ascend at the altar,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, and he shall be clean. 

21.  But if he be poor and his hand hath not enough, then shall he take one he-lamb as a guilt-bearer to be waved to put a propitiatory-covering over him,—and one-tenth of fine meal, overflowed with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil,

22. and two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, for which his hand hath enough,—so shall one be a sin-bearer, and the other an ascending-sacrifice.

23. And he shall bring them in on the eighth day, for his cleansing, unto the priest,—unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh.

24. Then shall the priest take the guilt-bearing lamb and the log of oil,—and the priest shall wave them as a wave-offering, before Yahweh.

25. Then shall the guilt-bearing lamb be slain, and the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt-bearer, and put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed,—and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot;

26. also of the oil, shall the priest pour out,—on the palm of his own left hand;

27. and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger, of the oil that is on the palm of his left hand,—seven times, before Yahweh;

28. then shall the priest put, of the oil that is on the palm of his hand, upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot,—upon the place of the blood of the guilt-offering;

29. and that which remaineth of the oil which is on the palm of the priest’s hand, shall he put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed,—to put a propitiatory-covering over him before Yahweh.

30. Then shall he offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons,—of that for which his hand hath enough;

31. even that for which his hand hath enough,—the one as a sin-bearer and the other as an ascending-sacrifice, upon the meal-offering,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him that is to be cleansed before Yahweh.

32. This is the law for him in whom hath been the plague of leprosy, whose hand hath not enough for that which pertaineth to his cleansing. 

33.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying:

34. When ye enter into the land of Canaan which I am about to give you for a possession,—and I put a plague-mark of leprosy in a house, of the land of your possession,

35. then shall he that owneth the house come in, and tell the priest, saying,—A kind of plague-mark, appeareth to me in the house;

36. and the priest shall give command, and they shall empty the house, ere yet the priest cometh in to view the mark, so that he do not pronounce unclean all that is in the house,—and, after this, shall the priest come in to view the house:

37. then shall he view the mark and lo! if the mark is in the walls of the house, with sunken places greenish yellow or reddish,—and they appear to be lower than the [surface of the] wall,

38. then shall the priest come forth out of the house, unto the entrance of the house,—and shall shut up the house seven days;

39. and the priest shall return on the seventh day,—and take a view, and lo! if the mark hath spread in the walls of the house,

40. then shall the priest give command, and they shall pull out the stones, wherein is the mark,—and cast them forth outside the city, into an unclean place;

41. and, the house itself, shall he cause to be scraped on the inside round about,—and they shall pour out the mortar which they have scraped off, outside the city, into an unclean place;

42. and shall take other stones, and put in the place of the stones,—and, other mortar, shall he take and plaster the house.

43. But if the mark again breaketh out in the house, after the taking out of the stones,—and after the scraping of the house and after the plastering,;

44. then shall the priest come in, and take a view, and lo! if the mark hath spread in the house, a fretting leprosy, it is in the house unclean, it is,

45. and he shall pull down the house,—the stones thereof, and the timber thereof and all the mortar of the house,—and shall carry them forth outside the city, into an unclean place.

46. And as for him that entereth into the house, all the days it is shut up, he shall be unclean until the evening;

47. And, he that lieth in the house, shall wash his clothes, and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

48. But, though the priest do come, into the house, and take a view, yet lo! if the plague-mark hath not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then shall the priest pronounce the house clean, for, healed, is the plague.

49. Then shall he take to cleanse, the house, two birds,—and cedar wood, and crimson, and hyssop;

50. and shall kill one bird,—within an earthen vessel over living water;

51. and take the cedar wood and the hyssop, and the crimson and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the living water,—and sprinkle the house seven times;

52. and so cleanse the house, with the blood of the bird and with the living water,—and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop, and with the crimson;

53. and shall let go the living bird unto the outside of the city, unto the face of the field,—so shall he put a propitiatory-covering over the house and it shall be clean. 

54.  This, is the law,—for every plague-mark of leprosy and for scall;

55. and for garment leprosy, and for house [leprosy] ;

56. and for rising, and for scab and for a bright spot;

57. to give instruction, on the day of declaring unclean, and on the day of declaring clean,—This is the law of leprosy.  

## Leviticus 15

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and ye shall say unto them,—When, any man whatsoever, hath a flowing from his flesh, his flux, is, unclean.

3. And, this shall be his uncleanness in his flux,—whether his flesh is running with his flux or his flesh hath closed from his flux, his uncleanness, it is.

4. All the bed whereon he that hath the flux lieth, shall be unclean,—and, every piece of furniture whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

5. And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.

6. And, he that sitteth on that whereon he that hath the flux hath sat, shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

7. And, he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the flux, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening,

8. And, when he that hath a flux spitteth on him that is clean, then shall he wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.

9. And, every saddle whereon he that hath the flux rideth, shall be unclean.

10. And, whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening; and, he that carrieth them shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

11. And, whomsoever he that hath the flux toucheth, not having rinsed, his hands in water, then shall he wash his clothes, and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening,

12. And the earthen vessel which he that hath the flux toucheth shall be broken in pieces,—and, every vessel of wood, shall be rinsed in water.

13. And when he that hath the flux becometh clean from his flux, then shall he number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes,—and bathe his flesh in living water, and be clean.

14. And, on the eighth day, he shall take for himself two turtle doves or two young pigeons,—and come in before Yahweh, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, and give them to the priest;

15. and the priest shall offer them, one as a sin-bearer and the other as an ascending-sacrifice,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over him, before Yahweh, because of his flux.

16. And, when there goeth out from, any man, an outflow of seed, then shall he bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.

17. And, in the case of any garment or any skin whereupon there shall come to be an outflow of seed, then shall it be washed in water, and be unclean until the evening.

18. Also, a woman with whom man lieth carnally, then shall they bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 

19.  And, when a, woman, hath a flow, and her flow in her flesh is, blood, seven days, shall she continue in her removal, and whosoever toucheth her, shall be unclean until the evening;

20. and, whatsoever she lieth upon in her removal, shall be unclean,—and, whatsoever she sitteth upon, shall be unclean;

21. and whosoever toucheth her bed, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening;

22. and, whosoever toucheth any thing whereon she sitteth shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening;

23. and, whether, on her bed, it is, or on any thing whereon she hath been sitting, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the evening;

24. and if man shall even lie with her, and her cause for removal be upon him, then shall he be unclean seven days,—and, all the bed whereon he shall lie, shall be unclean.

25. And when any woman’s, flow of blood lasteth many day, outside the time of her removal, or when it floweth beyond her removal, all the days of her unclean flow, shall she be as in the days of her removal—unclean, she is.

26. All the bed whereon she lieth during all the days of her flow, like her bed in her removal, shall be to her,—and, every thing whereon she sitteth, shall be, unclean, like the uncleanness in her removal;

27. and whosoever toucheth them, shall be unclean,—and shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

28. But, if she be clean from her flow, then shall she count to herself seven days and afterwards, shall she count herself clean.

29. And, on the eighth day, shall she take to herself two turtle doves, or two young pigeons,—and bring them in unto the priest, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting;

30. and the priest shall offer the one as a sin-bearer, and the other as an ascending-sacrifice,—so shall the priest put a propitiatory-covering over her, before Yahweh, because of her unclean flow.

31. Thus shall ye warn the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, And they shall not die in their uncleanness, By reason of their making unclean my habitation which is in their midst.

32. This, is the law—Of him that hath a flux,—And of him from whom goeth an outflow of seed, making unclean thereby;

33. And of her that is unwell with her cause for removal, And of him whose flux floweth, For the male, and for the female,—And for a man who lieth with her that is unclean.  

## Leviticus 16

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron,—when they had offered strange fire before Yahweh and died.

2. And Yahweh said unto Moses—Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he do not come at all times into the holy place, within the veil,—into the presence of the propitiatory, which is upon the ark, so shall he not die, for, in the cloud, will I appear upon the propitiatory.

3. Herewith, shall Aaron come into the holy place,—With a bullock the choice of the herd as a sin-bearer, and a ram as an ascending-sacrifice.

4. A holy tunic of linen, shall he put on and drawers of linen, shall be upon his flesh, and with a band of linen, shall he gird himself, and with a turban of linen, shall his head be wrapped about,—holy garments, they are, therefore shall he bathe in water his flesh, and so put them on. 

5.  And, from the assembly of the sons of Israel, shall he receive two he-goats, for bearing sin,—and one ram, as an ascending-sacrifice.

6. Then shall Aaron bring near the sin-bearing bullock which is for himself,—and put a propitiatory-covering about himself, and about his household.

7. Then shall he take the two goats,—and cause them to stand before Yahweh, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

8. And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats,—one lot for Yahweh, and one lot for Azazel.

9. Then shall Aaron bring near the goat over which came up the lot for Yahweh,—and shall make of him a sin-bearer;

10. but, the goat over which came up the lot for Azazel, shall he cause to stand alive—before Yahweh to put a propitiatory-covering over him,—to send him away unto Azazel, towards the desert.

11. So Aaron shall bring near the sin-bearing bullock which is for himself, and shall put a propitiatory-covering about himself, and about his household,—and shall slay the sin-bearing bullock which is for himself;

12. and shall take the censer-full of burning coals of fire from off the altar from before Yahweh, and his hands full of fragrant incense, beaten small,—and bring within the veil;

13. and shall put the incense upon the fire before Yahweh,—and the cloud of incense shall cover the propitiatory which is over the testimony, and he shall not die.

14. Then shall he take of the blood of the bullock, and shall sprinkle with his finger upon the face of the propitiatory, eastwards,—and before the propitiatory, shall he sprinkle seven times, of the blood, with his finger. 

15.  Then shall he slay the sin-bearing goat which is for the people, and bring in its blood, within the veil,—and do with its blood, as he did to the blood of the bullock, and shall sprinkle it, upon the propitiatory and before the propitiatory:

16. so shall he put a propitiatory-covering, over the holy place because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions to the extent of all their sins,—and, so, shall he do for the tent of meeting which abideth with them, in the midst of their uncleanness.

17. And no human being, shall be in the tent of meeting, when he cometh in to make a covering by propitiation in the holy place, until he goeth out,—so shall he put a propitiatory-covering about himself and about his household and about all the convocation of Israel.

18. Then shall he go out unto the altar which is before Yahweh and shall put a propitiatory-covering thereupon,—and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put upon the horns of the altar, round about;

19. and shall sprinkle upon it, of the blood with his finger seven times,—and shall cleanse it and hallow it, from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel. 

20.  And, when he hath made an end of covering by propitiation the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, then shall he bring near the living goat.

21. And Aaron shall lean his two hands upon the head of the living goat, and confess over him, all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, to the extent of all their sins,—and shall put them upon the head of the goat, and then send him away, by the hand of a man appointed towards the desert:

22. so shall the goat bear upon him all their iniquities into a lone land,—and he shall set the goat free, in the desert.

23. Then shall Aaron come into the tent of meeting, and put off the linen garments which he put on when he came into the holy place,—and shall leave them there;

24. and shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his [other] garments,—and go forth, and offer his own ascending-sacrifice, and the ascending-sacrifice of the people, so shall he put a propitiatory-covering about himself, and about the people;

25. and, with the fat of the sin-bearer, shall he make a perfume at the altar.

26. And he that sent away the goat unto Azazel, shall wash—his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water,—and, after that, shall he come into the camp.

27. And the, sin-bearing bullock, and the sin-bearing goat whose blood was brought in to make a propitiatory-covering in the holy place, shall be carried forth outside the camp,—and they shall burn up, in fire, their skins and their flesh, and their dung;

28. and he that hath burned them, shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water,—and, after that, shall he come into the camp. 

29.  And it shall become unto you, a statute age-abiding,—In the seventh month on the tenth of the month, Shall ye humble you souls And, no work, shall ye do, The home-born, Or the sojourner that sojourneth in your midst;

30. For on this day, shall a propitiatory-covering, be put over you, to cleanse you,—From all your sins before Yahweh, shall ye be clean.

31. A sabbath of sacred rest, it is unto you, Therefore shall ye humble your souls, A statute age-abiding.

32. Therefore shall the priest who shall be anointed, and installed, to minister as priest in the stead of his father make propitiation,—So then he shall put on the linen garments the holy garments;

33. And make propitiation for the holy sanctuary, And for the tent of meeting, and for the altar, shall he make propitiation,—Over the priests also and over all the people of the convocation, shall he put a covering by propitiation.

34. So shall this become unto you an age-abiding statute,—to put a propitiatory-covering over the sons of Israel because of all their sins, Once in the year. And he did, As Yahweh commanded Moses.  

## Leviticus 17

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:—

2. Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons and unto all the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded, saying:

3. What man soever, there be of the house of Israel, who slayeth an ox or lamb or goat, in the camp,—or who slayeth it outside the camp;

4. and, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, bringeth it not in, to present it as an oblation unto Yahweh, before the habitation of Yahweh, blood, shall be imputed to that man—blood, hath he shed, therefore shall that man be cut off from the midst of his people:

5. to the end that the sons of Israel may bring in their sacrifices which they are offering upon the face of the field, that they may bring them in unto Yahweh—unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, unto the priest,—and that so as peace-offerings unto Yahweh, they may offer them.

6. Then shall the priest dash the blood against the altar of Yahweh, at the entrance of the tent of meeting,—and shall make a perfume of the fat, as a satisfying odour unto Yahweh;

7. so shall they no more offer their sacrifices unto demons after whom they are unchastely going away,—a statute age-abiding, shall this be to them unto their generations.

8. Wherefore, unto them, shalt thou say: What man soever, there may be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners that sojourn in their midst,—who causeth to go up an ascending-offering, or a sacrifice;

9. and unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, doth not bring it in, to offer it unto Yahweh, then shall that man be cut off from among his kinsfolk. 

10.  And, what man soever, there may be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners that sojourn in their midst, that partaketh of any manner of blood, then will I set my face against the person that partaketh of the blood, and will cut him off from the midst of his people.

11. For as for the life of the flesh, in the blood, it is, therefore have, I, given it unto you upon the altar, to put a propitiatory-covering over your lives,—for the blood, it is, which, by virtue of the life, maketh propitiation.

12. For this cause, have I said unto the sons of Israel, Not a person from among you shall partake of blood,—Even the sojourner that sojourneth in your midst, shall not partake of blood.

13. And, what man soever, there may be of the sons of Israel, or of the sojourners that sojourn in their midst, who taketh by hunting any wild-beast or bird that may be eaten, then shall he pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust;

14. for, as for the life of all flesh, the blood thereof, for the life thereof, standeth, therefore have I said unto the sons of Israel—Of the blood of no manner of flesh, shall ye partake, For, the life of all flesh is the blood thereof; whoso partaketh thereof, shall be cut off.

15. And, in the case of any person who eateth that which died of itself or was torn in pieces, whether he be home-born, or a sojourner, then shall he wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening, and then be clean.

16. But, if he wash them not, and his flesh, he do not bathe, then shall he bear his iniquity.  

## Leviticus 18

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—I—Yahweh, am your God:—

3. After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do,—And after the doings of the land of Canaan whither, I, am bringing you in, shall ye not do, And, in their statutes, shall ye not walk:

4. My regulations, shall ye do, And, my statutes, shall ye observe to walk therein,—I—Yahweh, am your God.

5. Therefore shall ye observe my statutes, and my regulations, Which if the son of earth shall do them, Then shall he live in them,—I, am Yahweh. 

6.  No person whatsoever, unto any of the near kin of his own flesh, shall approach to uncover the parts of shame,—I, am Yahweh.

7. The shame of thy father, even the shame of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover,—thy mother, she is, thou shalt not uncover her shame.

8. The shame of thy father’s wife, shalt thou not uncover,—thy father’s shame, it is.

9. The shame of thy sister daughter of thy father or daughter of thy mother, born at home or born abroad, thou shalt not uncover their shame.

10. The shame of the daughter of thy son or the daughter of thy daughter, thou shalt not uncover their shame,—for, thine own shame, they are.

11. The shame of the daughter of thy father’s wife, born to thy father, she being, thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her shame.

12. The shame of thy father’s sister, shalt thou not uncover,—thy father’s near of kin, she is.

13. The shame of thy mother’s sister, shalt thou not uncover,—for, thy mother’s near of kin, she is.

14. The shame of thy father’s brother, shalt thou not uncover unto his wife, shalt thou not approach, thine aunt, she is.

15. The shame of thy daughter-in-law, shalt thou not uncover,—thy son’s wife, she is, thou shalt not uncover her shame.

16. The shame of thy brother’s wife, shalt thou not uncover,—the shame of thy brother, it is.

17. The shame of a woman, and of her daughter, shalt thou not uncover,—neither the daughter of her son nor the daughter of her daughter, shalt thou take, to uncover her shame, near of kin, they are, wickedness, it is.

18. And, a woman unto her sister, shalt thou not take,—to cause rivalry, by uncovering her shame besides her own while she is living. 

19.  And unto a woman during her removal for uncleanness, shalt thou not approach, to uncover her shame.

20. And of the wife of thy neighbour, shalt thou not have carnal knowledge,—to commit uncleanness with her.

21. And none of thy seed, shalt thou deliver up, to cause to pass through to Molech,—that thou profane not the name of thy God, I, am Yahweh.

22. And, with mankind, shalt thou not lie as with womankind,—an abomination, it is.

23. And of no beast, shalt thou have carnal knowledge to commit uncleanness therewith,—neither shall a woman present herself to a beast to couch down thereto,—confusion, it is.

24. Do not make yourselves unclean in any of these things,—For in all these things, have the nations made themselves unclean, whom, I, am sending out from before you.

25. Therefore hath the land become unclean, and I have visited the iniquity thereof upon it,—and the land hath vomited her inhabitants.

26. Ye, therefore, shall observe my statutes and my regulations, and have nothing to do with any of these abominations,—whether the home-born, or the sojourner that sojourneth in your midst;

27. For all these abominations, have the men of the land done, who were before you; And so the land hath become unclean:

28. So shall the land not vomit you, through your making it unclean,—as it vomited the nation which was before you.

29. For whosoever shall have anything to do with any of these abominations, the persons who have, shall be cut off, out of the midst of their people.

30. Therefore shall ye keep my charge, So that ye may have nothing to do with any of the abominable statutes with which they have had to do before you, So shall ye not make yourselves unclean thereby,—I—Yahweh, am your God.  

## Leviticus 19

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto all the assembly of the sons of Israel and thou shalt say unto them—Holy, shall ye be,—For holy, am I—Yahweh—your God

3. Ye shall, every one, revere, his father and his mother, And my sabbaths, shall ye observe,—I—Yahweh, am your God.

4. Do not turn unto things of nought, And, molten gods, shall ye not make to yourselves,—I—Yahweh, am your God.

5. And when ye would offer a peace-offering unto Yahweh, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.

6. On the day, ye offer it, shall it be eaten, and on the morrow,—but, that which remaineth until the third day, in fire, shall be consumed.

7. And, if it, be eaten, on the third day, unclean, it is it shall not be accepted,

8. But he that eateth it, his iniquity, shall bear, because that which had been hallowed unto Yahweh, hath he profaned,—so then that person shall be cut off from among his kinsfolk.

9. And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly clear the border of thy field, in reaping,—nor shalt thou gather up the gleaning of thy harvest.

10. And, thy vineyard, shalt thou not go over again, nor gather, every single grape: for the poor and for the sojourner, shalt thou leave them, I—Yahweh, am your God. 

11.  Ye shall not steal,—nor deceive nor lie one man to another;

12. Nor swear by my name falsely,—And so profane the name of thy God: I, am Yahweh.

13. Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour nor rob [him],—The wages of him that is hired shall not tarry with thee, until the morning.

14. Thou shalt not curse the deaf, Nor, before the blind, place a stumbling-block,—So shalt thou stand in awe of thy God I, am Yahweh.

15. Ye shall not act perversely in giving judgment, Thou shalt neither respect the person of the poor, Nor prefer the person of the great,—In righteousness, shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

16. Thou shalt not go about talebearing, among thy people Thou shalt not stand by, over the blood of thy neighbour: I, am Yahweh.

17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart,—Thou shalt, faithfully reprove, thy neighbour, and not countenance him in sin:

18. Thou shalt not take vengeance neither shalt thou cherish anger against the sons of thy people, So shalt thou love thy neighbour as thyself,—I, am Yahweh. 

19.  My statutes, shall ye observe, Thy beasts, shalt thou not cause to breed in two kinds, Thy field, shalt thou not sow with two sorts of seed,—And a garment woven of diverse threads, shalt thou not suffer to come upon thee.

20. And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, she being a bondmaid, acquired for a husband, and neither, redeemed, nor, freedom, given her, inquisition, shall be made they shall not be put to death, because she was not free;

21. but he shall bring in his guilt-bearer unto Yahweh, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting,—even a ram as a guilt-bearer;

22. and the priest shall put a propitiatory-covering over him with the guilt-bearing ram before Yahweh, on account of his sin which he hath committed,—so shall he have forgiveness, from his sin which he hath committed.

23. And when ye come into the land, and plant any manner of fruit-tree, then shall ye count as uncircumcised the fruit thereof, three years, shall it be to you as if unclean, it shall not be eaten.

24. But, in the fourth year, all the fruit thereof shall be hallowed for a festival of thanksgiving unto Yahweh.

25. And in the fifth year, shall ye eat the fruit thereof, that it may enrich you with its increase,—I—Yahweh, am your God.

26. Ye shall eat nothing with the blood thereof,—Ye shall not practise divination neither shall ye use magic.

27. Ye shall not shave in a circle around your head,—nor shalt thou disfigure the fringe of thy beard.

28. Cuttings for a dead person, shall ye not make in your flesh. And punctures in your persons, shall ye not print,—I, am Yahweh.

29. Do not profane thy daughter by causing her to be unchaste,—lest the land fall to unchastity, and so the land be filled with wickedness. 

30.  My sabbaths, shall ye observe, And my sanctuary, shall ye revere,—I, am Yahweh.

31. Do not turn unto mediums, Nor, for oracles, make search, To render yourselves unclean with them, I—Yahweh, am your God.

32. Before a hoary head, shalt thou rise up, And shalt honour the presence of an elder,—So shalt thou stand in awe of thy God—I, am Yahweh.

33. And, when there sojourneth with thee a sojourner in your land, ye shall not oppress him:

34. As one home born from among yourselves, shall be unto you the sojourner who sojourneth with you, So shalt thou love him as thyself, For, sojourners, became ye, in the land of Egypt,—I—Yahweh, am your God.

35. Ye shall not act perversely in giving judgment,—in measures of extent, in weights in measures of capacity:

36. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah and a just hin, shall ye have,—I—Yahweh, am your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt.

37. Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes and all my regulations and do them,—I, am Yahweh.  

## Leviticus 20

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Unto the sons of Israel, therefore shalt thou say, What man soever, there may be of the sons of Israel, or of the sojourners that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech, he shall, surely be put to death,—the people of the land shall stone him with stones;

3. I, also, will set my face against that man, and will cut him off out of the midst of his people,—because of his seed, hath he given unto Molech, seeing that he hath made unclean my sanctuary, even to the extent of profaning my holy name.

4. But, if the people of the land, do even hide, their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech,—so as not to put him to death,

5. then will I myself, set my face against that man, and against his family,—and will cut him off, and all that follow unchastely after him—in going unchastely after Molech—out of the midst of their people.

6. The person also that turneth unto mediums and unto oracles, in going unchastely after them, then will I set my face against that person, and will cut him off out of the midst of his people.

7. Therefore shall ye hallow yourselves and be holy,—Because I—Yahweh, am your God.

8. Therefore shall ye observe my statutes, and do them,—I—Yahweh, am he that is hallowing you.

9. When, any man whatsoever, curseth his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death,—his father or his mother, hath he cursed, his blood, shall be upon himself. 

10.  And, any man, who committeth adultery with the wife of any other man, he that committeth adultery with the wife of his neighbour shall surely be put to death—the adulterer, and the adulteress.

11. And any man who lieth with his father’s wife, the shame of his father, hath uncovered,—they both shall, surely be put to death—their blood shall be upon themselves.

12. And any man who lieth with his daughter-in-law, they both shall, surely be put to death, confusion, have they wrought—their blood shall be upon themselves.

13. And any man who lieth with mankind as with womankind, an abomination, have both of them wrought,—they shall, surely be put to death,—their blood, shall be upon themselves.

14. And, any man, who taketh a woman and her mother, wickedness, it is,—in fire, shall both he and they be consumed, that wickedness be not in your midst.

15. And, any man, who hath carnal knowledge of a beast, shall, surely be put to death,—and, the beast, shall ye slay.

16. And, a woman, who approacheth unto any beast, to couch down thereto, then shalt thou slay the woman and the beast,—they shall surely be put to death,—their blood, shall be upon themselves.

17. And, any man, who taketh his sister—his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and vieweth her shame, and, she, vieweth his shame, a disgrace, it is,—they shall therefore be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people,—the shame of his sister, hath he uncovered—his iniquity, shall he bear.

18. And, any man, who lieth with a woman having her sickness, and uncovereth her shame, her fountain, hath he exposed, she, also hath uncovered her fountain of blood,—they shall therefore both be cut off out of the midst of their people.

19. And the shame of thy mother’s sister, or of thy father’s sister, shalt thou not uncover,—for his near of kin, hath he exposed—their iniquity, shall they bear.

20. And, any man, who lieth with his uncle’s wife, the shame of his uncle, hath he uncovered,—their sin, shall they bear—childless, shall they die.

21. And, any man, who taketh his brother’s wife, impurity, it is,—the shame of his brother, hath he uncovered—childless, shall they remain. 

22.  Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes and all my regulations, and do them,—So shall the land whereinto I am bringing you to dwell therein, not vomit you forth;

23. So shall ye not walk in the—statutes of the nations, which I am casting out from before you,—For all these things, had they done, Therefore I abhorred them;

24. And said unto you—Ye, shall possess their soil, Yea, I myself, will give it you to possess it, A land flowing with milk and honey,—I—Yahweh, am your God, who have distinguished you from the peoples;

25. Therefore shall ye make a distinction—Between the clean beasts, and the unclean,—And between the unclean birds and the clean,—So shall ye not make your persons abominable with beast, or with bird or with anything which creepeth upon the ground, which I have distinguished for you, as unclean.

26. Therefore shall ye be unto me, holy persons, for, holy, am, I—Yahweh,—Therefore have I distinguished you from the peoples, that ye may be mine.

27. And as touching man or woman, when there shall be in them a familiar spirit, or the spirit of an oracle, they shall, surely be put to death,—with stones, shall they be stoned—their blood, shall be upon themselves.  

## Leviticus 21

1. And Yahweh said unto Moses, Say unto the priests, the sons of Aaron,—yea thou shalt say unto them, For a dead person, shall no one make himself unclean among his people:

2. Saving for his kin, that are near unto him, for his mother or for his father, or for his son or for his daughter, or for his brother;

3. or for his sister, a virgin who is near unto him, who belongeth not unto a husband,—for her, he may make himself unclean:

4. He shall not make himself unclean being a chief among his people,—by profaning himself:

5. They shall not make a baldness behind in their head, And the border of their beard, shall they not cut off,—And, in their flesh, shall they not make incisions.

6. Holy persons, shall they be unto their God, and not profane the name of their God,—for, the altar-flames of Yahweh, the food of their God, do they bring near—Therefore shall they be holy.

7. A woman that is unchaste or dishonoured, shall they not take, And a woman divorced from her husband, shall they not take,—For holy, he is unto his God.

8. Therefore shalt thou hold him as holy, for the food of thy God, doth he bring near,—Holy, shall he be to thee, For, holy, am I—Yahweh, who am making you holy.

9. And, the daughter of any priest, when she profaneth herself by unchastity, Her father, she, doth profane, with fire, shall she be consumed. 

10.  And, as for the high priest from among his brethren upon whose head is poured the anointing oil, and who is installed, by putting on the garments, His head, shall he not bare, And, his garments, shall he not rend;

11. And, unto no persons of the dead, shall he go in,—For his father or for his mother, shall he not make himself unclean;

12. And, out of the sanctuary, shall he not go forth, so shall he not profane the sanctuary of his God,—for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him—I, am Yahweh.

13. But, he, shall take a woman in her virginity:

14. A widow or a divorced woman or one dishonoured—an unchaste woman, these, shall he not take, But, a virgin from among his own kinsfolk, shall he take to wife;

15. So shall he not profane his seed, among his kinsfolk,—For I—Yahweh, do hallow him. 

16.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

17. Speak unto Aaron, saying,—No man of thy seed, unto their generations in whom shall be any blemish, shall come near, to present the food of his God.

18. Surely, no man in whom is any blemish, shall come near,—No man who is blind or lame, or hath a flat nose, or is lanky;

19. nor any man who hath a broken foot,—or a broken hand;

20. or is hump-backed or a dwarf, or hath defective vision,—or hath scurvy or scab, or is crushed in the stones:

21. No, man in whom is a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest, shall approach, to bring near the altar-flames of Yahweh,—a blemish, is in him, the food of his God, shall he not approach to bring near:

22. Of the food of his God, both of the most holy,—and the holy, may he eat:

23. Only, unto the veil, shall he not come in and unto the altar, shall he not approach—because, a blemish, is in him, so shall he not profane my sanctuaries, For, I—Yahweh, am hallowing them.

24. And Moses spake [these things] unto Aaron, and unto his sons,—and unto all the sons of Israel.  

## Leviticus 22

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, That they hold sacredly aloof from the holy things of the sons of Israel, so as not to profane my holy name,—in the things which they are hallowing unto me—I, am Yahweh.

3. Say unto them—Unto your generations, as touching any man who cometh near from among any of your seed, unto the hallowed things which the sons of Israel may hallow unto Yahweh, while his uncleanness is upon him, then shall that person be cut off from before me—I, am Yahweh.

4. No man soever of the seed of Aaron who is a leper, or hath a flux, shall eat of the holy things, until he be clean,—And as for him who toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

5. or a man who toucheth any creeping thing, which is unclean to him,—or [toucheth] any human being who hath uncleanness, to the extent of any thing that maketh him unclean,

6. any person who toucheth any such, shall then be unclean until the evening,—and shall not eat of the hallowed things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.

7. When the sun tooth in, then is he clean,—and thereafter, he may eat of the hallowed things, for, his food, it is.

8. That which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces, shall he not eat to make himself unclean thereby,—I, am Yahweh.

9. Therefore shall they keep my charge, and shall not bear, for it, sin, and die therein, when they profane it,—I—Yahweh, am hallowing them. 

10.  And, no stranger, shall eat what is hallowed,—neither, one who dwelleth with a priest nor a hireling shall eat what is hallowed.

11. But when, a priest, buyeth any person, as the purchase of his silver, he may eat thereof,—and, the children of his household, they, may eat of his food.

12. And, when, a priest’s daughter, belongeth to a husband, who is a stranger, she, of the heave-offering of the hallowed things, may not eat.

13. But, when a priest’s daughter, cometh to be a widow or divorced and hath no seed, and so she returneth unto the house of her father, as in her youth, of the food of her father, she may eat,—but no stranger, shall eat thereof.

14. And, when, any man, eateth what is hallowed, by mistake, then shall he add the fifth part of it thereunto, and give unto the priest the hallowed thing:

15. So shall they not profane the hallowed things of the sons of Israel,—which they heave up unto Yahweh;

16. nor cause them to bear guilty iniquity, when they eat their hallowed things,—For, I—Yahweh, am hallowing them. 

17.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

18. Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them—What man, soever, of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, may bring near his oblation, as regardeth any of their vows, or any of their freewill offerings which they may bring near unto Yahweh, as an ascending-sacrifice,

19. that ye may be accepted, [it must be] a male without defect, of the beeves, or of the sheep, or of the goats:

20. whatsoever hath in it a blemish, shall ye not bring near,—for it shall not be accepted for you.

21. And, whosoever would bring near a peace-offering unto Yahweh, to consecrate a vow or as a freewill-offering with a bullock or a sheep, without defect, shall it be, to be accepted, no, blemish, shall be therein.

22. Blind, or broken, or rent, or having a running sore, or scurvy, or scab, ye shall not bring these near unto Yahweh,—and no, altar-flame, shall ye present therefrom upon the altar, unto Yahweh.

23. Whether an ox or a lamb long or short limb, as a free-will offering, thou mayest offer it, but, for a vow, it shall not be accepted.

24. But that which is bruised in the stones or broken therein, or torn or cut, shall ye neither bring ear unto Yahweh, nor on your own land, shall ye offer.

25. Even at the hand of the son of a stranger, shall ye not bring near the food of your God of any of these,—for, their damage is in them, a blemish, is in them, they shall not be accepted for you.

26. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:—

27. When, a beeve or a sheep or a goat, is brought forth, then shall it be seven days under its dam,—and, from the eighth day and onwards, it shall be accepted as an oblation of an altar-flame unto Yahweh,

28. Whether cow or ewe—it and its young, shall ye not slaughter on one day.

29. And when ye would offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Yahweh, for your acceptance, shall ye offer it.

30. On the same day, shall it be eaten, ye shall not leave thereof until morning,—I, am Yahweh.

31. So then ye shall observe my commandments, and do them,—I, am Yahweh.

32. So shall ye not profane my holy name, So shall I be hallowed in the midst of the sons of Israel,—I, am Yahweh, who am hallowing you;

33. Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might become your God,—I, am Yahweh.  

## Leviticus 23

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel and thou shalt say unto them, As for the appointed seasons of Yahweh, which ye shall proclaim as holy convocations, these, are they—my appointed seasons:—

3. Six days, shall work be done, but, on the seventh day, shall there be a sabbath of sacred rest a holy convocation, no work, shall ye do,—a sabbath, shall it be unto Yahweh, in all your dwellings. 

4.  These, are the appointed seasons of Yahweh, holy convocations,—which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season:—

5. In the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the evenings, is a Passover unto Yahweh;

6. and on the fifteenth day of this month, is the festival of unleavened cakes unto Yahweh,—seven days—unleavened cakes, shall ye eat.

7. On the first day—a holy convocation, shall there be to you: no laborious work, shall ye do.

8. So then ye shall bring near an altar-flame unto Yahweh, seven days,—on the seventh day, [shall there be] a holy convocation, no laborious work, shall ye do.

9. And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:

10. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them:—When ye enter into the land which, I, am giving you, and ye reap the harvest thereof, then shall ye bring in a sheaf of the first-ripe corn of your harvest, unto the priest;

11. and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, that ye may be accepted,—on the morrow of the sabbath, shall the priest wave it.

12. And ye shall offer on the day when ye wave the sheaf, a he-lamb without defect, the finest of its year for an ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh;

13. and the, meal-offering thereof shall be two-tenth parts of fine meal overflowed with oil, as an altar-flame unto Yahweh a satisfying odour,—and, the drink-offering thereof, [shall be] mine, the fourth of a hin.

14. And neither bread, nor roasted corn, nor garden-land grain, shall ye eat, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought in the oblation of your God,—an age-abiding statute unto your generations, in all your dwellings. 

15.  Then shall ye keep count to yourselves from the morrow of the sabbath, from the day ye brought in the wave sheaf,—seven sabbaths complete, shall there be:

16. until on the morrow of the seventh sabbath, ye count fifty days,—then shall ye bring near a new meal-offering unto Yahweh.

17. Out of your dwellings, shall ye bring in two wave loaves of two-tenths of an ephah, of fine meal, shall they be, with leaven, shall they be baked,—first-fruits unto Yahweh.

18. Then shall ye bring near with the bread seven he-lambs without defect of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams,—they shall be an ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, an altar-flame of satisfying odour unto Yahweh.

19. Then shall ye offer one he-goat, as a sin-bearer,—and two he-lambs, of the first year, as a peace-offering.

20. And the priest shall wave them, with the firstfruits’ bread, as a wave-offering before Yahweh, with the two he-lambs,—holy, shall they be unto Yahweh, for the priest.

21. And ye shall make proclamation on this self-same day—a holy convocation, shall it be unto you; no laborious work, shall ye do,—an age-abiding statute in all your dwellings, unto your generations.

22. And, when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly clear the border of thy field when thou reapest, and, the gleanings of thy field, shalt thou not glean,—for the poor and for the sojourner, shalt thou leave them. I—Yahweh, am your God. 

23.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

24. Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying:—In the seventh month on the first of the month, shall there be unto you a sacred rest, a trumpet-blowing commemoration a holy convocation:

25. no laborious work, shall ye do,—but ye shall bring near an altar-flame unto Yahweh.

26. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying,

27. Surely on the tenth of this seventh month, is, the Day of Propitiation, a holy convocation, shall it be to you, therefore shall ye humble your souls,—and bring near an altar-flame unto Yahweh.

28. And, no work, shall ye do, on this selfsame day,—for a day of propitiation, it is, to put a propitiatory-covering over you before Yahweh your God.

29. For, whosoever be the person that shall not be humbled on this selfsame day, then shall he be cut off from among his kinsfolk.

30. And, whosoever be the person that shall do any work on this selfsame day, then will I destroy that person from the midst of his people.

31. No work, shall ye do,—an age-abiding statute to your generations, in all your dwellings.

32. A sabbath of sacred rest, shall it be unto you, so shall ye humble your souls,—on the ninth of the month in the evening, from evening to evening, shall ye keep your sabbath. 

33.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

34. Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying:—On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, shall be the festival of booths, for seven days, unto Yahweh.

35. On the first day, [shall be] a holy convocation,—no laborious work, shall ye do.

36. Seven days, shall ye bring near an altar-flame unto Yahweh: on the eighth day—a holy convocation, shall there be unto you so shall ye bring near an altar-flame unto Yahweh—the closing of the feast, it is, no laborious work, shall ye do.

37. These, are the appointed seasons of Yahweh, which ye shall proclaim, as holy convocations,—for bringing near as an altar-flame unto Yahweh, an ascending-sacrifice, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice and a drink-offering, each day’s appointment on its own day:—

38. besides the sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your presents, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings which ye shall give unto Yahweh.

39. Surely, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the yield of the land, shall ye celebrate the festival of Yahweh seven days,—on the first day, a sacred rest, and, on the eighth day, a sacred rest.

40. So then ye shall take you, on the first day, boughs of goodly trees, branches, of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and poplars of the ravine,—and shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, seven days.

41. So shall ye celebrate it as a festival unto Yahweh, seven days in the year,—a statute age-abiding, to your generations. In the seventh month, shall ye celebrate it;

42. In booths, shall ye dwell seven days;—All the home-born in Israel, shall dwell in booths:

43. To the end that your generations may know, that, in booths, made I the sons of Israel to dwell, when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,—I—Yahweh, am your God.

44. So then Moses declared, the appointed seasons of Yahweh, unto the sons of Israel.  

## Leviticus 24

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Command the sons of Israel, That they bring unto thee—pure oil olive, beaten, for giving light,—to cause the lamp to burn up continually.

3. Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron order it, from evening until morning, before Yahweh continually,—a statute age-abiding, to your generations.

4. Upon the pure lampstand, shall he order the lamps,—before Yahweh, continually.

5. And thou shalt take fine meal, and bake it, in twelve cakes,—of two-tenths, shall each cake be.

6. And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row,—upon the pure table, before Yahweh.

7. And thou shalt put upon each row pure frankincense,—so shall it belong unto the bread as a memorial, an altar-flame unto Yahweh.

8. Sabbath day by sabbath day, shall he order it before Yahweh continually,—from the sons of Israel as an age-abiding covenant:

9. so shall it be for Aaron and for his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place,—for most holy, shall it be unto him from among the altar-flames of Yahweh, a statute age-abiding. 

10.  And forth went the son of a woman of Israel—he being the son of a man of Egypt—in the midst of the sons of Israel;

11. and the son of the woman of Israel, and a man of Israel, reviled one another in the camp. And the son of the Israelitish woman uttered contemptuously the Name, and reviled. So they brought him in unto Moses,—now, the name of his mother, was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;

12. and they put him in ward,—that a clear answer might be given to them at the mouth of Yahweh.

13. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

14. Bring forth him that reviled unto the outside of the camp, then shall all that heard [him] lean their hands upon his head,—and all the assembly shall stone him.

15. And, unto the sons of Israel, shalt thou speak saying,—What man soever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

16. And, he that contemptuously uttereth the name of Yahweh, shall be, surely put to death, all the assembly shall, surely stone, him,—as the sojourner so the home-born, when he contemptuously uttereth the Name, he shall be put to death.

17. And, when, any man, by smiting taketh the life of any human being, he shall be surely put to death,

18. And he that by smiting taketh away the life of a beast, shall make it good,—life for life.

19. And, when, any man, inflicteth a blemish upon his neighbour, as he hath done, so, shall it be done to him:

20. fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, as he inflicteth a blemish upon a human being, so, shall one be inflicted upon him.

21. And he that killeth a beast, shall make it good,-and he that killeth a human being, shall be put to death.

22. One rule, shall ye have, as the sojourner, so the home-born, shall be,—For, I—Yahweh, am your God.

23. So then Moses spake unto the sons of Israel, and they took forth the reviler, unto the outside of the camp, and stoned him with stones. Thus, the sons of Israel did, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  

## Leviticus 25

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses in Mount Sinai, saying—

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them:—When ye enter into the land which, I, am giving you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Yahweh.

3. Six years, shalt thou sow thy field, and, six years, shalt thou prune thy vineyard,—and gather the increase thereof;

4. but, in the seventh year—a sabbath of sacred rest, shall there be unto the land, a sabbath unto Yahweh: thy field, shalt thou not sow, and, thy vineyard, shalt thou not prune;

5. that which groweth of itself of thy harvest, shalt thou not reap; and the grapes of thine unpruned vines, shalt thou not cut off: a year of sacred rest, shall there be to the land.

6. So shall the sabbath of the land be unto you for food: unto thee, and unto thy servant and unto thy handmaid,—and unto thy hireling, and unto thy settlers that are sojourning with thee;

7. and unto thy tame-beasts, and unto the wild-beasts that are in thy land, shall belong all the increase thereof for food. 

8.  And thou shalt count to thee seven weeks of years, seven years, seven times,—so shall the days of the seven weeks of years become to thee forty-nine years.

9. Then shalt thou cause a signal-horn to pass through in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month: on the Day of Propitiation, shall ye cause a horn to pass throughout all your land.

10. So shall ye hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim freedom throughout the land to all the dwellers thereof,—a jubilee, shall it be unto you, and ye shall return, every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family, shall ye return.

11. A jubilee, shall that fiftieth year be unto you,—ye shall not sow, neither shall ye reap the self-grown corn thereof, nor cut off the grapes of the unpruned vines thereof.

12. For, a jubilee, it is, holy, shall it be unto you,—out of the field, shall ye eat her increase.

13. In this same jubilee year, shall ye return every man unto his possession.

14. And when ye sell anything to thy neighbour, or buy aught at thy neighbour’s hand, do not overreach one another.

15. By the number of years after the jubilee, shalt thou buy of thy neighbour,—by the number of the years of increase, shall he sell unto thee;

16. according to the multitude of the years, shalt thou increase the price thereof, and, according to the fewness of the years, shalt thou diminish the price thereof,—because the sum of the increase, it is that he selleth thee.

17. So then ye shall not overreach one another; but thou shalt stand in awe of thy God,—for, I—Yahweh, am your God.

18. Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and my regulations, shall ye observe and do them,—so shall ye dwell upon the land with confidence;

19. and the land shall yield her fruit; and ye shall eat to the full,—and shall dwell with confidence thereupon.

20. And since ye may say, What shall we eat in the seventh year? Lo! we are not to sow, neither are we to gather our increase!

21. Therefore will I command my blessing upon you, in the sixth year,—and it shall make the increase of three years;

22. and ye shall sow, the eighth year, and eat of old store,—until the ninth year until the coming in of the increase thereof, shall ye eat old store. 

23.  The land moreover shall not be sold beyond recovery, for, mine, is the land,—for, sojourners and settlers, ye are with me.

24. And, in all the land of your possession, a right of redemption, shall ye give to the land.

25. When thy brother waxeth poor, and so selleth aught of his possession, then may his kinsman that is near unto him come in, and redeem that which was sold by his brother.

26. And, when, any man, hath no kinsman,—but his own hand getteth enough, so that he findeth what is needed to redeem it,

27. then shall he reckon the years since he sold it, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it,—and shall return to his possession.

28. But, if his hand have not found enough to get it back unto him, then shall that which he sold remain in the hand of him that bought it, until the year of the jubilee,—and shall go out in the jubilee, and he shall return unto his possession.

29. And, when, any man, selleth a dwelling-house in a walled city, then shall his right of redemption remain until the completion of a year after he sold it,—for, [a year of] days, shall his right of redemption remain.

30. But, if it be not redeemed before the end of a full year, then shall the house that is in the city that hath walls be confirmed, beyond recovery, to him who bought it, unto his generations,—it shall not go out in the jubilee.

31. But as for the houses of villages which have no wall round about them, with the fields of land, shall it be reckoned,—a right of redemption, shall belong to it, and, in the jubilee, shall it go out.

32. And as for the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, an age-abiding right of redemption, shall pertain unto the Levites.

33. And, if one of the Levites should not redeem, then shall the sale of the house and the city of his possession go out in the jubilee; for, the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession, in the midst of the sons of Israel.

34. But the field of the pasture-land of their cities, shall not be sold,—for an age-abiding possession, it is unto them.

35. And, when thy brother waxeth poor, and his hand becometh feeble with thee, then shalt thou strengthen him, as a sojourner and a settler, so shall he live with thee.

36. Do not accept from him interest or profit, but stand thou in awe of thy God,—so shall thy brother live with thee.

37. Thy silver, shalt thou not give him on interest,—neither, for profit, shalt thou give him thy food.

38. I—Yahweh, am your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt,—to give unto you the land of Canaan, to become your God, 

39.  And when thy brother waxeth poor with thee, and so selleth himself unto thee, thou shalt not bind him with the bondage of a bondman:

40. as a hired servant, as a settler, shall he remain with thee,—until the year of the jubilee, shall he serve with thee:

41. then shall he go forth from thee, he and his sons with him,—and shall return unto his family, and unto the possession of his fathers, shall he return.

42. For, my bondmen, they are, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt,—they shall not sell themselves with the sale of a bondman.

43. Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour,—so shalt thou stand in awe of thy God.

44. And as for thy bondman and thy bond-maid which thou shalt have, of the nations that are round about you—from them, may ye buy bondman and bond-maid.

45. Moreover also, of the sons of the settlers who are sojourning with you—of them, may ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land,—so shall they become yours, as a possession;

46. and ye may take them as an inheritance for your sons after you to inherit as a possession, unto times age-abiding, of them, may ye take to be bondmen,—but, over your brethren the sons of Israel—a man over his brother, ye shall not rule, over him with rigour.

47. And, when the hand of the sojourner and settler with thee getteth possessions, and thy brother with him, waxeth poor,—and so he selleth himself to the sojourner [who is] a settler with thee, or to one who hath taken root, of the family of the sojourner,

48. after that he hath sold himself, a right of redemption, pertaineth to him,—one of his brethren, may redeem him;

49. or, his uncle or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or, a near flesh-relation of his, of his family, may redeem him, or, his own hand may have gotten enough, and, so he may redeem himself.

50. Then shall he reckon with him that bought him, from the year that he was sold to him, unto the year of the jubilee,—and the silver for which he was sold shall be by the number of years, according to the days of a hired servant, shall he be with him.

51. If there is yet a multitude of years, according to them, shall he return, as his redemption price, of the silver of him that bought him.

52. Or, if [there is] but a small remainder of years, until the year of the jubilee, then shall he reckon to himself, according to the years thereof, shall he return his price of redemption.

53. As a servant hired year by year, shall he be with him, he shall not rule over him with rigour, before thine eyes.

54. But if he be not redeemed in any of these ways, then shall he go out in the jubilee year, he, and his sons with him.

55. For, unto me, are the sons of Israel, bondmen, my bondmen, they are, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. I, Yahweh, am your God.  

## Leviticus 26

1. Ye shall not make unto you idols,—neither image nor pillar, shall ye set up for yourselves, nor sculptured stone, shall ye place in your land, to bow yourselves down thereunto,-For, I Yahweh, am your God.

2. My sabbaths, shall ye observe, And, my sanctuary, shall ye revere,—I, am Yahweh.

3. If, in my statutes, ye will walk,—And my commandments, ye will observe, and do them,

4. Then will I give your rains in their season,—And the land shall yield her increase, And, the trees of the field, shall yield their fruit.

5. Then shall your threshing reach unto the vintage, And, the vintage, shall reach unto the seedtime,—And ye shall eat your food to the full, And shall dwell securely in your land.

6. And I will give peace in the land, And ye shall lie down, and nothing shall make you afraid; And I will take away vicious beasts out of the land; And, the sword, shall not go through your land.

7. And ye shall chase your foes,—And they shall fall before you by the sword;

8. And, five, of you shall chase, a hundred, And, a hundred, of you shall put ten thousand to flight,—So shall your foes fall before you, by the sword.

9. And I will turn unto you, And make you fruitful,—And multiply you, And will establish my covenant with you.

10. And ye shall eat old store well seasoned,—And the old from before the new, shall ye put forth.

11. And I will set my habitation in your midst,—And my soul shall not abhor you;

12. But I will walk to and fro in your midst, And will be unto you a God, And, ye, shall be unto me a people.

13. I—Yahweh, am your God who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; so I brake in pieces the staves of your yoke, and caused you to walk, erect. 

14.  But, if ye will not hearken unto me, And will not do all these commandments;

15. And if, my statutes, ye refuse, And, my regulations, your souls shall abhor,—So that ye will not do all my commandments, But shall break my covenant

16. I also, will do this unto you—I will set over you, for terror, consumption and fever, Causing the eyes to fail and the soul to pine away,—And ye shall sow, in vain, your seed, for it shall be eaten by your foes.

17. And I will set my face against you, And ye shall be smitten before your foes,-And be trodden down by them who hate you, And shall flee when no one is pursuing you.

18. And, if even with these things, ye will not hearken unto me, Then will I yet further correct you seven times, for your sins.

19. So will I break your pomp of power, And will set your heavens as iron, and your land as bronze;

20. And your strength shall be spent in vain,—And your land shall not yield her increase, And the trees of the land, shall not yield their fruit.

21. If therefore, ye will go in opposition to me, And not be willing to hearken unto me, Then will I yet further plague you seven times according to your sins;

22. And will send among you the wild-beast of the field And it shall rob you of your children, And cut off your cattle, And make you few in number; And your roads shall be silent.

23. And, if, by these things, ye will not be corrected by me,—But will go in opposition to me,

24. Then will, I also, go in opposition to you. And, I, even I, will plague you seven times for your sins;

25. And will bring in upon you a sword that shall inflict the covenanted avenging: So shall ye be gathered into your cities,—Then will I send a pestilence into your midst, And ye shall be delivered into the hand of an enemy.

26. When I have broken your staff of bread, then shall ten women bake your bread in one oven, And give back your bread by weight,—And ye shall eat and not be filled.

27. And, if, with this, ye will not hearken to me,—But will go in opposition to me,

28. Then will I go in a rage of opposition to you,—And I, even I, will correct you seven times for your sins;

29. And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons,—Yea, even the flesh of your daughters, shall ye eat.

30. And I will destroy your high places And cut down your sun-pillars, And cast your carcases upon the carcases of your manufactured gods,—Thus shall my soul abhor you.

31. And I will give your cities unto desolation, And make your holy places dumb,—And will find no fragrance in your satisfying odour;

32. And, I, will make the land dumb, And your foes that dwell therein shall regard it with dumb amazement:

33. When, even you, I scatter among the nations, And make bare after you, a sword, Then shall your land become an astonishment, And your cities become a desolation.

34. Then, shall the land be paid her sabbaths, All the days she lieth desolate, While, ye, are in the land of your foes,—Then, shall the land keep sabbath, And pay off her sabbaths:

35. All the days she lieth desolate, shall she keep sabbath,—the which she kept not as your sabbaths,—while ye dwelt thereupon.

36. And as for such as are left of you, Then will I bring faintness into their heart, in the lands of their foes,—So that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, And they shall flee as though fleeing from a sword And they shall fall, when no one is pursuing;

37. And they shall stumble one upon another as from before a sword, when, pursuer there is none; And ye shall not have wherewith to stand before your foes;

38. And ye shall perish among the nations,—And the land of your foes shall eat you up;

39. And they who are left of you, shall melt away in their iniquity, in the lands of your foes; Yea also, in the iniquity of their fathers with them, shall they melt away. 

40.  Then shall they confess their iniquity, And the iniquity of their fathers, In their unfaithfulness wherewith they had been unfaithful towards me; Yea moreover, because they had gone in opposition to me,

41. I also, must needs go in opposition to them, and bring them into the land of their foes,—Save only that, if, even then, their uncircumcised heart shall be humbled, And, even then, they shall accept as a payment the punishment of their iniquity,

42. Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob Yea moreover, my covenant with Isaac, Yea moreover, my covenant with Abraham, will I remember; And the land, will I remember.

43. For, the land, shall be left of them, And shall be paid her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them, They also, accepting, as a payment, the punishment of their iniquity, Because, yea because, my regulations, they refused, And my statutes, their soul abhorred.

44. And yet even so when they are in the land of their foes I have not refused them Neither have I abhorred them To make an end of them, To break my covenant with them,—For, I—Yahweh, am their God.

45. Therefore will I remember in their behalf the covenant of their ancestors,—Whom, I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God—I—Yahweh.

46. These are the statutes and the regulations and the laws, which Yahweh granted between himself, and the sons of Israel,—in Mount Sinai by the mediation of Moses.  

## Leviticus 27

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel and thou shall say unto them—When any man would consecrate and pay a vow by thine estimate of lives unto Yahweh,

3. then shall, thine estimate be for the male from twenty years of age even to sixty years of age, yea thine estimate shall be—fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary;

4. but if it be, a female, then shall thine estimate be thirty shekels.

5. And, if it be from five years of age even unto twenty years of age, then shall thine estimate be for the male, twenty shekels,—and, for the female, ten shekels.

6. And, if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then shall thine estimate be—for the male, five shekels of silver,—and, for the female, thine estimate [shall be] three shekels of silver.

7. And if it be from sixty years of age and upwards, if a male, then shall thine estimate be fifteen shekels,—and, for the female, ten shekels.

8. But if he be, too poor, for thine estimate, then shall he present himself before the priest, and the priest shall estimate him,—according to that which the hand of him who would vow can attain to, shall the priest estimate him.

9. And if it be a beast whereof men may bring near an oblation unto Yahweh, all that whereof aught is given to Yahweh, shall be holy.

10. He shall not alter it, nor change it—good for bad or bad for good,—but if he, do, change beast for beast, then shall, both it and what was given in exchange for it be holy.

11. And, if it be any unclean beast whereof men may not bring near an oblation to Yahweh, then shall he present the beast before the priest:

12. and the priest shall estimate it, whether it is good or bad,—according to thine estimate, O priest, so, shall it be.

13. But if he should please to redeem, it, then shall he add the fifth part thereof unto thine estimate. 

14.  And, when, any man, would hallow his house to be holy unto Yahweh, then shall the priest estimate it, whether it is good or bad,—as the priest shall estimate it, so, shall it stand.

15. But, if he that halloweth it, would redeem his house, then shall he add the fifth part of the silver of thine estimate thereunto and it shall be his.

16. And if of the field of his possession any man would hallow unto Yahweh, then shall thine estimate be according to the seed thereof,—the seed of a homer of barley, at fifty shekels of silver.

17. If, from the year of jubilee, he would hallow his field, according to thine estimate, shall it stand.

18. But if after the jubilee he would hallow his field, then shall the priest reckon to him the silver, according to the years that remain, until the year of the jubilee,—and it shall be abated from thine estimate.

19. But, if he that hath hallowed it should be pleased to redeem, the field, then shall he add the fifth part of the silver of thine estimate thereunto and it shall be assured to him.

20. But if he will not redeem the field, but have sold the field to another man, it shall be redeemable no longer;

21. so shall the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, be holy unto Yahweh as a devoted, field,—to the priest, shall belong the possession thereof.

22. If, however, a field that he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession, he would hallow unto Yahweh,

23. then shall the priest reckon to him the amount of thine estimate until the year of the jubilee,—and he shall give thine estimate, in that day, as holy unto Yahweh.

24. In the year of the jubilee, shall the field return unto him from whom he bought it to him whose it was as a possession in the land.

25. And, every estimate of thine, shall be by the holy shekel,—twenty gerahs, make the shekel. 

26.  Only the firstling which is born a firstling to Yahweh, among beasts, no man shall hallow it,—whether ox or sheep, unto Yahweh, it belongeth.

27. But, if it be among the beasts that are unclean, then shall he ransom it by thine estimate, and add the fifth part of it thereunto,—but, if it is not redeemed, then shall it be sold by thine estimate.

28. Only no devoted thing which any man shall devote unto Yahweh, of all that belongeth to him,—of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be either sold or redeemed,—as to every devoted thing, most holy, it is unto Yahweh.

29. As touching any one devoted, who may be devoted from among men he shall not be ransomed,—he must be, surely put to death.

30. And, as for all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land, [or] of the fruit of the trees, unto Yahweh, it belongeth,—as something holy unto Yahweh.

31. But, if any man should be pleased, to redeem, aught of his tithes, the fifth part thereof, shall he add thereunto.

32. And, as for all the tithe of herd and flock, all that passeth under the rod, the tenth, shall be holy unto Yahweh.

33. He shall not examine whether it be good or bad neither shall he change it,—or, if he do in anywise change, it, then shall both, it and what is given in exchange for it, be holy, it shall not be redeemed.

34. These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel,—in Mount Sinai.
