1. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses in the desert of Sinai in the tent of meeting,—on the first of the second month in the second year by their coming forth out of the land of Egypt saying:

2. Reckon ye up the sum of all the assembly of the sons of Israel, by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names, every male, by their polls;

3. from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war in Israel,—ye shall number them by their hosts, thou and Aaron;

4. and with you, shall be one man for each tribe,—each man, head of his ancestral house, shall be.

5. These, then, are the names of the men who shall stand with you,—Of Reuben, Elizur, son of Shedeur;

6. Of Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;

7. Of Judah, Nahshon, son of Amminadab;

8. Of Issachar, Nethanel, son of Zuar;

15. Of Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.

16. These, are they who had been summoned by the assembly, being princes of the tribes of their fathers,—heads of the thousands of Israel. 

17.  So then Moses and Aaron took these men, who were distinguished by name;

18. all the assembly also, called they together on the first of the second month,—and they declared their pedigree according to their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names from twenty years old and upwards by their polls.

19. As Yahweh commanded Moses, so he mustered them in the desert of Sinai.

20. And they were [as followeth] —The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, in their pedigrees—by their families, by their ancestral houses, in the counting of names, by their polls, every male, from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

21. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Reuben, forty-six thousand and five hundred.

22. Of the sons of Simeon, in their pedigrees by their families by their ancestral houses,—such as were numbered of him, in the counting of names by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

23. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Simeon, fifty-nine thousand and three hundred.

24. Of the sons of Gad, in their pedigrees—by their families by their ancestral houses, in the counting of names from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war:

25. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Gad, forty-five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

26. Of the sons of Judah, in their pedigrees by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names, from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

27. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Judah, seventy-four thousand and six hundred.

28. Of the sons of Issachar, in their pedigrees—by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names, from twenty year old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

29. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Issachar, fifty-four thousand and four hundred.

30. Of the sons of Zebulun, in their pedigrees—by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

31. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Zebulun, fifty-seven thousand and four hundred.

32. Of the sons of Joseph—Of the sons of Ephraim, in their pedigrees—by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names, from twenty years old, and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

33. such as were numbered of them, as belonging to the tribe of Ephraim, forty thousand and five hundred.

34. Of the sons of Manasseh, in their pedigrees—by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

35. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Manasseh, thirty-two thousand, and two hundred.

36. Of the sons of Benjamin, in their pedigrees by their families, by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names, from twenty years old, and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

38. Of the sons of Dan, in their pedigrees by their families by their ancestral houses, in the counting of names from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

39. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Dan, sixty-two thousand, and seven hundred.

40. Of the sons of Asher, in their pedigrees—by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names, from twenty years old, and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

41. such as were numbered of them as belonging to the tribe of Asher, forty-one thousand, and five hundred.

42. The sons of Naphtali, in their pedigrees by their families by their ancestral houses,—in the counting of names, from twenty years old, and upwards, every one able to go forth to war;

43. such as were numbered of them, as belonging to the tribe of Naphtali, fifty-three thousand, and four hundred. 

44.  These, are they who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron and the twelve princes of Israel did number, the princes acting each one for his ancestral house.

45. So then all they who were numbered of the sons of Israel by their ancestral houses, from twenty years old and upwards, every one able to go forth to war in Israel;

46. so then all they who were numbered were six hundred and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 

47.  But the Levites by the tribe of their fathers were not numbered in their midst.

48. For Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:

49. Only the tribe of Levi, shalt thou not number, nor the sum of them, shalt thou reckon up, in the midst of the sons of Israel.

50. But do, thou thyself, put the Levites in charge over the habitation of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof and over all that pertaineth thereto, they, shall bear the habitation, and all the furniture thereof, and they, shall attend thereupon; and, round about the habitation, shall they encamp.

51. And, when the habitation is to set forward, the Levites shall take it down, and when the habitation is to be pitched, the Levites, shall set it up, but the stranger that draweth near, shall be put to death.

52. So then the sons of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man, near his own camp, and, every man, near his own standard, by their hosts;

53. but the Levites, shall pitch their tents round about the habitation of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the assembly of the sons of Israel,—so shall the Levites keep the watch of the habitation of the testimony.

54. Thus did the sons of Israel,—according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so, did they.

18. the standard of the camp of Ephraim, by their hosts westwards,—even the prince of the sons of Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud;

19. and his host, even they who are numbered of them,—forty thousand, and five hundred.

33. But the Levites, were not numbered in the midst of the sons of Israel,—As Yahweh commanded Moses.

34. Thus did the sons of Israel,—according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so, did they encamp by their standards, and so, did they set forward, every one by his families near his ancestral house.  

## Numbers 3

1. Now, these, were the pedigrees of Aaron and Moses,—in the day when Yahweh spake with Moses in Mount Sinai.

2. And these, are the names of the sons of Aaron—the firstborn Nadab,—and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

3. These, are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed,—who were installed to minister as priests.

4. But Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh when they brought near strange fire before Yahweh in the desert of Sinai, and sons, had they none,—so then Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests, in the presence of Aaron their father.

5. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying—

6. Bring near the tribe of Levi, and thou shalt cause it to stand before Aaron the priest,—so shall they wait upon him;

7. so shall they keep his charge, and the charge of all the assembly, before the tent of meeting,—to do the laborious work of the habitation;

8. so shall they have charge of all the furniture of the tent of meeting, even the charge of the sons of Israel,—to do the laborious work of the habitation.

9. Thus shalt thou give the Levites unto Aaron and unto his sons,—given, given, they are unto him, from among the sons of Israel;

10. but unto Aaron, and unto his sons, shalt thou give oversight, so shall they keep charge of their priesthood,—and, the stranger who cometh near, shall be put to death.

11. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying—

12. I, therefore, lo! I have taken the Levites out of the midst of the sons of Israel, instead of every firstborn that a mother beareth, from among the sons of Israel,—so shall the Levites be mine;

13. for, mine, is every firstborn, in the day when I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I hallowed unto myself every firstborn in Israel, both of man and of beast,—mine, did they become, and belong unto me, Yahweh. 

14.  Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, in the desert of Sinai, saying:—

15. Number thou the sons of Levi, by their ancestral houses, by their families,—every male, from one month old and upwards, shalt thou number them.

16. So then Moses numbered them according to the bidding of Yahweh,—as he was commanded.

17. And these were the sons of Levi, by their names,—Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.

18. And these, the names of the sons of Gershon by their families,—Libni and Shimei.

19. And, the sons of Kohath, by their families Amram, and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.

20. And the sons of Merari by their families, Mahli and Mushi. These, are they—the families of the Levites by their ancestral houses.

21. To, Gershon, belonged the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimeites,—these, are they—the families of the Gershonites.

22. They who were numbered of them in the counting of every male, from one month old, and upwards,—they who were num-bered of them, were seven thousand and five hundred.

23. the families of the Gershonites, to the rear of the habitation, were to encamp, westward.

24. And, the prince of the ancestral house of the Gershonites, was Eliasaph son of Lael.

25. And, the charge, of the sons of Gershon, was over the tent of meeting, the habitation, and the tent,—the covering thereof, and the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting;

26. and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the entrance of the court which was near the habitation and near the altar, round about,—and the cords thereof, as to all the laborious work thereof.

27. And to Kohath, belonged the family of the Amramites and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites,—these, are they—the families of the Kohathites.

28. In, the counting of every male, from one month old and upwards, there were eight thousand and six hundred, to keep the charge of the sanctuary.

29. The, families of the sons of Kohath, were to encamp,—on the side of the habitation, south-ward.

30. And the prince of the ancestral house of the families of the Kohathites, was Elizaphan, son of Uzziel.

31. And their charge, was—the ark and the table and the lampstand and the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary wherewith they were to minister,—and the screen, as to all the laborious work thereof.

32. And the prince of the princes of the Levites, was Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest,—to have the oversight of them that were to keep the charge of the sanctuary.

33. To Merari, belonged the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites,—these, are they—the families of Merari.

34. And they who were numbered of them in the counting of every male, from one month old and upwards, were six thousand, and two hundred.

35. And the prince of the ancestral house of the families of Merari, was Zuriel son of Abihail,—on the side of the habitation, were they to encamp northward.

36. And the oversight of the charge of the sons of Merari, was—the boards of the habitation, and the bars thereof and the pillars thereof and the sockets thereof,—and all the furniture thereof, as to all the laborious work thereof;

37. also the pillars of the court round about and their sockets,—and their pins and their cords.

38. But, they who were to encamp before the habitation eastwards before the tent of meeting, towards sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons. to keep the charge of the sanctuary, as the charge of the sons of Israel and, the stranger that came near, was to be put to death.

39. All they who were numbered of the Levites whom Moses [and Aaron] numbered at the bidding of Yahweh by their families,—every male, from one month old and upwards, were two-and-twenty thousand. 

40.  And Yahweh said unto Moses: Number thou every firstborn male belonging to the sons of Israel, from one month old and upwards,—and reckon up the number of their names;

41. then shalt thou take the Levites for me, me Yahweh, instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel,—also the cattle of the Levites, instead of every firstling among the cattle of the sons of Israel.

42. So then Moses numbered, as Yahweh commanded him,—every firstborn among the sons of Israel.

43. And it was so—that all the firstborn of the males in the counting of names from one month old and upwards of such as were numbered of them,—were two-and-twenty thousand, two hundred and seventy-three.

44. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:—

45. Take the Levites, instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites, instead of their cattle,—so shall the Levites belong unto me, me Yahweh;

46. and as the ransom of the two hundred and seventy-three,—who are more than the Levites, of the firstborn of the sons of Israel,

47. thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll,—by the shekel of the sanctuary, shalt thou take it, twenty gerahs to the shekel;

48. and shalt give the silver to Aaron and to his sons,—as the ransom of them that are in excess over them.

49. So Moses took the redemption silver from them who were in excess over them who were redeemed by the Levites:

50. from the firstborn of the sons of Israel, took he the silver,—a thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary,

51. And Moses gave the redemption silver to Aaron and to his sons at the bidding of Yahweh,—As Yahweh commanded Moses.  

## Numbers 4

1. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses and unto Aaron saying:

2. Reckon up the sum of the sons of Kohath, out of the midst of the sons of Levi,—by their families by their ancestral house:

3. from thirty years old, and upwards, even unto fifty years,—every one that can enter into the host, to do service in the tent of meeting.

4. This, shall be the labour of the sons of Kohath, in the tent of meeting,—the most holy things,

5. So then Aaron and his sons shall enter when the camp is to set forward, and take down the screening veil,—and enwrap therein the ark of the testimony;

6. and put thereon a covering of badgers’ skin, and spread a complete wrapper of blue over above,—and put in the staves thereof.

7. And over the Presence-table, shall they spread a wrapper of blue and put thereon the dishes and the pans and the bowls and the libation cups, the perpetual bread also, thereupon, shall remain;

8. and they shall spread over them a wrapper of crimson, and cover the same with a covering of badgers’ skin,—and shall put in the staves thereof.

9. Then shall they take a wrapper of blue, and cover the light-giving lampstand, and the lamps thereof, and the snuffers thereof and the snuff-trays thereof,—and all the oil-vessels, thereof, wherewith they minister thereunto;

10. and shall put the same and all the vessels thereof, within a covering of, badgers’ skin,—and shall put it upon a frame.

11. And upon the altar of gold, shall they spread a wrapper of blue, and shall cover the same in a covering of badgers’ skin,—and shall put in the staves thereof,

12. And they shall take all the utensils of attendance wherewith they attend in the sanctuary, and put them within a wrapper of blue, and cover the same in a covering of badgers’ skin,—and put them on a frame.

13. Then shall they remove the fat-ashes from the altar,—and spread over it a wrapper of purple;

14. and put thereupon all the utensils thereof wherewith they minister thereupon—the fire-pans, the flesh-hooks—and the shovels and the tossing-bowls, all the utensils of the altar,—and shall spread over it a covering of badgers’ skin and put in the staves thereof.

15. So shall Aaron and his sons make an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the utensils of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set forward, then after that, shall the sons of Kohath enter to bear it, but they must not put forth a touch unto that which, is holy, else should they die, these, shall be the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.

16. But the care of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, [shall be] —the light-giving oil, and the fragrant incense, and the perpetual meal-offering, and the anointing oil, the care of all the habitation, and all that is therein, both as to the sanctuary, and as to the furniture thereof.

17. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:

18. Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off out of the midst of the Levites.

19. This, therefore, do ye for them, so shall they live and not die when they approach the most holy place,—Aaron and his sons shall enter and set them man by man over his labour, and unto his burden;

20. but they shall not enter to see, for a moment, that which is holy, else should they die. 

21.  Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

22. reckon up the sum of the sons of Gershon even of them also,—by their ancestral house by their families;

23. from thirty years old and upwards even to fifty years, shalt thou number them,—All that may enter to take rank in the host, to do laborious work in the tent of meeting.

24. This, shall be the labour of the families of the Gershonites,—in labouring and in bearing:

25. they shall bear the curtains of the habitation and the tent of meeting, the covering thereof and the covering of badgers’ skin which is over above it,—and the screen, at the entrance of the tent of meeting;

26. and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the entrance of the gate of the court which is near the habitation and near the altar round about, and their cords, and all their articles of service, and all that is to be done to them when they shall do their labour,

27. At the bidding of Aaron and his sons, shall be all the labour of the sons of the Gershonites, to the extent of their every burden, and to the extent of all their labour,—so shall ye appoint unto them in charge their every burden.

28. This, shall be the labour of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting,—and, the charge of them, shall be in the hand of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.

29. As for the sons of Merari,—by their families by their ancestral house, shall ye number them;

30. from thirty years old and upwards even to fifty years, shall ye number them,—all that enter into the host, to do laborious work in the tent of meeting,

31. And, this, shall be their charge of the burdens, to the extent of all their labour in the tent of meeting, the boards of the habitation, and the bars thereof and he pillars thereof and the sockets thereof:

32. and the pillars of the court round about and their sockets and their pins and their cords, to the extent of all their articles, to the extent of all their labour, and by names, shall ye put under their care the articles of their charge of burdens.

33. This, shall be the labour of the families of the sons of Merari, to the extent of all their labour in the tent of meeting,—in the hand of Ithamar, son of Aaron, the priest. 

34.  Then did Moses and Aaron, and the princes of the assembly, number the sons of the Kohathites, by their families, and by their ancestral house;

35. from thirty years old and upwards, even unto fifty years old, all that might enter the host, to labour in the tent of meeting;

36. and they who were numbered of them, by their families, were found to be two thousand, seven hundred and fifty.

37. These, were they who were num-bered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might labour in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron did number, at the bidding of Yahweh by the mediation of Moses.

38. And they who were numbered of the sons of Gershon,—by their families, and by their ancestral house;

39. from thirty years old and upwards, even to fifty years old, all that might enter the host, to labour in the tent of meeting,:

40. yea they who were numbered of them, by their families, by their ancestral house,—were found to be—two thousand, and six hundred, and thirty.

41. These, are they who were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, all who might labour in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron did number, at the bidding of Yahweh.

42. And they who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families by their ancestral house;

43. from thirty years old and upwards, even unto fifty years old,—all that might enter the host to labour in the tent of meeting;

44. yea they who were numbered of them, by their families, were found to be—three thousand and two hundred.

45. These, are they who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari,—whom Moses and Aaron did number, at the bidding of Yahweh, by the mediation of Moses.

46. All they who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel did number, even the Levites, by their families and by their ancestral house;

47. from thirty years old and upwards, even unto fifty years old, all that might enter, to toil in the work of labouring and in the work of bearing burdens, in the tent of meeting,

48. yea, they who were numbered of them were found to be—eight thousand, and five hundred, and eighty.

49. At the bidding of Yahweh, were they put in charge by the mediation of Moses, man by man, over his labour and over his burden,—yea, they who were put in charge by him, were they, whom Yahweh commanded Moses.  

## Numbers 5

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:—

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they send forth out of the camp, every leper, and every one that hath a flux,—and every one that is unclean by the dead:

3. whether male or female, ye shall send them forth, unto the outside of the camp, shall ye send them,—that they make not their camps unclean, in the midst whereof, I, have my habitation.

4. And the sons of Israel did so, and sent them forth unto the outside of the camp,—as Yahweh spake unto Moses, so, did the sons of Israel.

5. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

6. Speak unto the sons of Israel: When any man or woman, shall do aught of any human sin, in acting unfaithfully against Yahweh,—and that person shall become aware of his guilt,

7. then shall they confess their sin which they have done, and he shall make good that wherein he is guilty, in the principal thereof, and the fifth part thereof, shall he add thereunto,—and give to him against whom he is guilty,

8. But if one have no kinsman unto whom he may make good that wherein he is guilty, then that wherein he is guilty, which is to be restored to Yahweh, shall be the priest’s,—besides the ram of propitiation, wherewith a propitiatory-covering is to be put over him.

9. And every heave-offering, of all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel which they bring near to the priest, unto him, shall it belong.

10. And, every man’s hallowed things, shall be, his own,—what any man giveth to the priest, shall be his. 

11.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:

12. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—When any man’s wife, shall turn aside, and commit against him an act of unfaithfulness;

13. and a man shall lie with her carnally, and it shall be concealed from the eyes of her husband and be kept close but, she, hath committed uncleanness,—though witness, there is none against her, and she, hath not been caught;

14. but there shall pass over him a spirit of jealousy, and he shall become jealous of his wife, she having committed uncleanness,—or there shall pass over him a spirit of jealousy, and he shall become jealous of his wife, she not, having committed uncleanness,

15. then shall the man bring in his wife unto the priest, and shall bring in her offering for her, the tenth of an ephah of the meal of barley,—he shall not pour thereon oil, nor put thereon frankincense, for a jealousy gift, it is, a reminding gift bringing to mind iniquity.

16. Then shall the priest bring her near,—and cause her to stand before Yahweh;

17. and the priest shall take hallowed water in an earthen vessel,—and of the dust which shall be upon the floor of the habitation, shall the priest take, and put into the water;

18. and the priest shall cause the woman to stand before Yahweh, and shall bare the head of the woman, and shall place upon her hands the reminding gift, it being a jealousy gift,—and in the hand of the priest, shall be the deadly water that bringeth a curse;

19. and the priest shall put her on oath and shall say unto the woman:—If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not turned aside in uncleanness, [unto another] instead of thy husband, be thou clear from this deadly water that causeth a curse.

20. But, if, thou, hast turned aside, [to another] instead of thy husband and if thou hast made thyself unclean,—in that a man hath known thee carnally, other than thy husband,

21. then shall the priest put the woman on oath with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, Yahweh give thee up for a curse and for an oath in the midst of thy people,—in that Yahweh shall give up thy thigh to fall away, and thy womb to swell:

22. so shall this water that causeth a curse enter into thy body, causing womb to swell and thigh to fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.

23. Then shall the priest write these curses in a scroll,—and wipe them out into the deadly water;

24. and shall cause the woman to drink the deadly water that causeth a curse,—and the deadly water that causeth a curse shall enter into her.

25. Then shall the priest take from the hand of the woman the jealousy meal-offering,—and shall wave the meal-offering before Yahweh, and bring it near unto the altar;

26. and the priest shall take a handful from the meal-offering, a remembrancer thereof, and make a perfume at the altar,—and afterwards, shall cause the woman to drink the water.

27. And as soon as he causeth her to drink, the water, then shall it be, that, if she have fallen into uncleanness and committed unfaithfulness against her husband, as soon as the deadly water that causeth a curse hath entered into her, so soon shall her womb swell and her thigh fall away,—thus shall the woman become a curse in the midst of her people.

28. But, if the woman have not fallen into uncleanness, but is pure, then shall she be clear and shall bear seed.

29. This, is the law of jealousies,—when a wife shall turn aside [to another] instead of her husband, and fall into uncleanness;

30. or when there passeth over, a husband, a spirit of jealousy, and he becometh jealous of his wife, then shall he cause the woman to stand before Yahweh, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law:

31. thus shall the man be clear of iniquity; but that woman, shall bear her iniquity.  

## Numbers 6

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—When any man or woman, would make the special vow of One Separate, by separating himself unto Yahweh,

3. from wine and strong drink, shall he separate himself, neither vinegar of wine nor vinegar of strong drink, shall he drink,—and no liquor of grapes, shall he drink, no grapes fresh or dried, shall he eat.

4. All the days of his separation, of nothing that is made from the grapevine from the seeds even to the skin, shall he eat.

5. All the days of his vow of separation, no razor, shall pass over his head,—until the days are fulfilled for which he shall separate himself to Yahweh hallowed, shall he be, letting the locks of the hair of his head grow long.

6. All the days for which he hath separated himself unto Yahweh to no dead person, shall he go in.

7. Neither for his father nor for his mother nor for his brother nor for his sister, shall he make himself unclean-not even for them, should they die,—because, his separation unto God, is upon his head,

8. All his days of separation hallowed, is he unto Yahweh.

9. But if one that is dying should die by him in a moment suddenly, then shall he count unclean his head of separation,—and shall shave his head, on the day he cleanseth himself, on the seventh day, shall he shave it.

10. And on the eighth day, shall he bring in. two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons,—unto the priest, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting;

11. and the priest shall make, of one a sin—bearer and of one an ascending-sacrifice, and so put a propitiatory-covering over him, for that he sinned in respect of the dead person,—thus shall he hallow his head on that day.

12. Then shall he separate unto Yahweh his days of separation, and shall bring in a he-lamb a year old as a guilt-bearer,—and, the first days, shall be lost because his separation, was made unclean.

13. And, this, is the law of the Separate One, on the day when he fulfilleth his days of separation, he shall be brought in unto the entrance of the tent of meeting:

14. then shall he bring near as his offering unto Yahweh.—one he-lamb a year old, without defect for an ascending-sacrifice, and one ewe-lamb a year old without defect for a sin-bearer,—and one ram, without defect for a peace-offering;

15. and a basket of unleavened cakes—fine meal in round cakes overflowed with oil, and thin cakes of unleavened bread, anointed with oil,—with their meal-offering and their drink-offerings.

16. Then shall the priest bring [them] near before Yahweh,—and offer his sin-bearer and his ascending-sacrifice;

17. and the ram, shall he offer as a peace-offering unto Yahweh, besides the basket of unleavened cakes,—and the priest shall offer the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offering thereof,

18. Then shall the Separate One shave, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, his head of separation,—and take the hair of his head of separation, and put upon the fire, which is under the peace-offering.

19. Then shall the priest take the shoulder for boiling from the ram, and one unleavened round cake from the basket, and one unleavened thin cake,—and place them on the hands, of the Separate One after he hath shaven off his [hair of] separation;

20. and the priest shall wave them as a wave-offering before Yahweh, hallowed, it is for the priest, besides the wave breast, and besides the heave leg,—and, afterwards, may the Separate One drink wine.

21. This is the law of One Separate what he shall vow, his offering unto Yahweh with respect to his separation, besides what his hand may obtain: as required by the vow that he shall vow, so, must he do, with respect to the law of his separation. 

22.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

23. Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons saying Thus, shall ye bless the sons of Israel,—saying unto them:

24. Yahweh bless thee, and keep thee:

25. Yahweh cause his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee:

26. Yahweh lift up his face unto thee, and appoint unto thee peace.

27. Thus shall they put my name upon the sons of Israel,—and, I, myself, will bless them.  

## Numbers 7

1. And it came to pass, on the day when Moses made an end of rearing up the habitation and anointing it, and hallowing it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar, and all the utensils thereof,—both of anointing them, and hallowing them,

2. that the princes of Israel, the heads of their ancestral houses, made an offering,—they being princes of the tribes, they being the men who stood over them who were numbered:

3. yea then brought they in as their offering, before Yahweh—six covered waggons, and twelve oxen, a waggon for every two of the princes and an ox for each one,—yea they brought them near before the habitation.

4. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

5. Take [them] of them, so shall they be for doing the laborious work of the tent of meeting,—and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to the need of his laborious work.

6. So Moses took the waggons, and the oxen,—and gave them unto the Levites:

7. two of the waggons and four of the oxen, gave he unto the sons of Gershon,—according to the need of their laborious work;

8. and four of the waggons, and eight of the oxen, gave he unto the sons of Merari,—according to the need of their laborious work, in the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest;

9. but, unto the sons of Kohath, gave he none,—because as to the laborious work of the sanctuary which pertained unto them, upon their shoulders, were they to carry it. 

10.  So then the princes offered for the dedication of the altar, on the day it was anointed,—yea the princes offered their oblation before the altar,

11. And Yahweh said unto Moses: Each prince on his appointed day, thus shall they offer their oblation, for the dedication of the altar.

89. And when Moses entered into the tent of meeting, that He might speak with him, then heard he the Voice speaking unto him from off the propitiatory that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim,—so He spake unto him.  

## Numbers 8

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:

2. Speak unto Aaron, and thou shalt say unto him,—When thou lightest up the lamps, over against the front of the lampstand, shall the seven lamps give light.

3. And Aaron did so, over against the front of the lampstand, lighted he up the lamps thereof,—As Yahweh commanded Moses,

4. Now, this, was the work of the lampstand—beaten work of gold both in the shaft thereof and in the flowers thereof, was it beaten work, according to the appearance which Yahweh caused to appear unto Moses, so, made he the lampstand. 

5.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

6. Take the Levites, out of the midst of the sons of Israel,—and thou shalt purify them.

7. And, thus, shalt thou do unto them, to purify them, sprinkle upon them sin-cleansing water,—then shall they, cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and shall wash their clothes and so make themselves pure.

8. Then shall they take a choice young bullock, with the meal-offering thereof even fine meal overflowed with oil,—and a second choice young bullock, shalt thou take. as a sin-bearer.

9. Then shalt thou bring the Levites near, before the tent of meeting,—and shalt call together all the assembly of the sons of Israel;

10. and shalt bring the Levites near before Yahweh,—and the sons of Israel shall lean their hands upon the Levites;

11. and Aaron shall offer the Levites as a wave-offering before Yahweh, from among the sons of Israel,—so shall they be for performing the laborious work of Yahweh.

12. And, the Levites, shall lean their hands upon the head of the bullocks; then make thou of the one a sin-bearer and of the other an ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh, to put a propitiatory-covering over the Levites.

13. Thus shalt thou cause the Levites to stand before Aaron and before his sons,—thus shalt thou offer them as a wave-offering unto Yahweh;

14. thus shalt thou separate the Levites out of the midst of the sons of Israel,—thus shall the Levites become mine.

15. And after that, shall the Levites enter to do the labour of the tent of meeting,—so shalt thou purify them, and offer them as a wave-offering,

16. For, given, given, they are unto me, out of the midst of the sons of Israel,—instead of every firstborn that a mother beareth from among the sons of Israel, have I taken them unto me.

17. For mine, is every firstborn among the sons of Israel, among men and among beasts,—on the day when I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt, did I hallow them unto me.

18. Therefore have I taken the Levites,—instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel;

19. therefore have I given the Levites as a gift unto Aaron and unto his sons, out of the midst of the sons of Israel, to do the laborious work of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to put a propitiatory-covering over the sons of Israel,—so shall there be among the sons of Israel, no plague, by the coming nigh of the sons of Israel unto the sanctuary.

20. And Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the sons of Israel did thus unto the Levites,—according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses as touching the Levites, so, did the sons of Israel unto them.

21. And the Levites accepted the cleansing from sin and washed their clothes, and Aaron offered them as a wave-offering before Yahweh,—and Aaron put a propitiatory-covering over them to make them pure.

22. And after that, went the Levites in to do their laborious work in the tent of meeting, before Aaron and before his sons,—as Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so, did they unto them.

23. And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying;

24. This is what concerneth the Levites,—from twenty-five years old and upwards, shall they enter to take rank in the host, for doing the laborious work of the tent of meeting;

25. but from the age of fifty years, shall they retire from taking rank in the labour, and shall do laborious work no more;

26. yet shall they wait upon their brethren in the tent of meeting, by keeping charge, but laborious work, shall they not perform,—thus, shalt thou do unto the Levites, as touching their charges.  

## Numbers 9

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the second year by their coming forth out of the land of Egypt in the first month, saying:

2. Let the sons of Israel therefore, keep the passover in its appointed season:

3. on the fourteenth day of this month between the two evenings, shall ye keep it, in its appointed season,—according to all the statute thereof and according to all the regulations thereof, shall ye keep it.

4. Then spake Moses unto the sons of Israel that they should keep the passover.

5. So they kept the passover in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month between the two evenings, in the desert of Sinai,—according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so, did the sons of Israel.

6. But so it was that there were, certain men who had become unclean by a dead person, and could not keep the passover on that day,—therefore came they near before Moses and before Aaron on that day.

7. Then said those men unto him, We, are unclean by a dead person,—wherefore should we become of less esteem for want of offering the oblation of Yahweh in its appointed season, in the midst of the sons of Israel?

8. And Moses said unto them,—Stay, and let me hear, what Yahweh shall command concerning you!

9. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

10. Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying,—Though, any man, be unclean by a dead person or be on a journey afar off, whether in the case of yourselves or of your generations, yet shall he keep a passover unto Yahweh.

11. In the second month, on the fourteenth day between the two evenings, shall they keep it,—with unleavened cakes and bitter herbs, shall they eat it.

12. They shall not leave thereof until morning, and no bone, shall they break therein—according to all the statutes of the passover, shall they keep it.

13. But as for the man who is, clean, and no a journey, doth not chance to be and yet faileth to keep the passover, that person shall he cut off from among his kinsfolk,—for the oblation of Yahweh, hath he not offered in its appointed season, his own sin, shall, that man, bear.

14. When moreover there may sojourn with you a sojourner, who would keep a passover unto Yahweh, according to the statute of the passover, and according to the regulation thereof, so, must he keep [it],—one statute, shall there be for you, both for the sojourner and for the native of the land. 

15.  Now, on the day the habitation was reared, the cloud covered the habitation, even the tent of the testimony,—and in the evening, it was over the habitation, like an appearance of fire, until morning,

16. Thus, came it to pass continually, the cloud, covered it,—and an appearance of fire, by night;

17. but at the bidding of the upgoings of the cloud from off the tent, then, after that, the sons of Israel set forward,—and in the place where the cloud abode, there the sons of Israel encamped:

18. at the bidding of Yahweh, the sons of Israel set forward, and at the bidding of Yahweh, they encamped,—all the days that the cloud abode upon the habitation, they remained encamped.

19. And when the cloud lengthened out its stay upon the habitation, many days, then would the sons of Israel keep the watch of Yahweh, and would not set forward.

20. And, so it was, when the cloud would be a few days upon the habitation, at the bidding of Yahweh, they remained encamped, and at the bidding of Yahweh, they set forward.

21. And, so it was, when the cloud would be from evening until morning, as soon as the cloud went up in the morning, so soon did they set forward: whether by day or by night, as soon as the cloud went up, so soon did they set forward.

22. Whether for two days or a month or a year, the cloud lengthened out its stay upon the habitation abiding thereupon, the sons of Israel remained encamped and set not forward,—but at the upgoings thereof, they set forward.

23. At the bidding of Yahweh, they encamped, and at the bidding of Yahweh, they set forward,—the watch of Yahweh, they kept, at the bidding of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.  

## Numbers 10

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Make thee two trumpets of silver, of beaten work, shalt thou make them,—and they shall be unto thee for calling the assembly, and for setting forward the camps.

3. As soon as they blow therewith, so soon shall all the assembly assemble themselves unto thee, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting.

4. And, if, only once, they blow, then shall the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, gather themselves unto thee.

5. But when ye blow an alarm, then shall set forward the camps that are encamped eastwards;

6. and when ye blow a second alarm, then shall set forward the camps that are encamped southwards,—an alarm, shall they blow for setting them forward,

7. But in calling together the convocation, ye shall blow but shall not sound an alarm.

8. And, the sons of Aaron the priests, shall blow with the trumpets,—and it shall be unto you for a statute age-abiding, unto your generations.

9. And when ye go into war in your land against the assailant that assaileth you, then shall ye blow an alarm with the trumpets,—and bring yourselves to mind before Yahweh your God, and be saved, from your enemies,

10. And in your day of rejoicing and in your appointed seasons and in the beginnings of your months, then shall ye blow with the trumpets, over your ascending-sacrifices, and over your peace-offerings,—so shall they be unto you for a memorial before your God. I—Yahweh, am your God. 

11.  And so it came to pass in the second year, in the second month on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud lifted itself up, from off the habitation of the testimony;

12. and the sons of Israel set forward by their removals from the desert of Sinai, and then the cloud abode in the desert of Paran.

13. Thus then did they set forward for the first time,—at the bidding of Yahweh, by the hand of Moses.

14. So the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set forward first, by their hosts, and over his own host, was Nahshon, son of Amminadab;

15. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, Nethanel, son of Zuar;

16. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, Eliab, son of Helon.

17. Then was taken down the habitation,—and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward bearing the habitation.

18. Then set forward the standard of the camp of Reuben, by their hosts,—and over his own host, Elizur, son of Shedeur;

19. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai;

20. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad, Eliasaph, son of Deuel.

21. Then set forward the Kohathites, bearing the sanctuary,—and so the habitation was reared by the time they came in.

22. Then set forward the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim by their hosts,—and over his own host, was Elishama son of Ammihud;

23. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur;

24. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, Abidan, son of Gideoni.

25. Then set forward the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, bringing up the rear of all the camps, by their hosts,—and over his own host, Ahiezur, son of Ammishaddai;

26. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher, Pagiel, son of Ochran;

27. and, over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, Ahira, son of Enan.

28. These, were the settings-forward of the sons of Israel by their hosts,—thus did they set forward. 

29.  Then said Moses to Hobab, son of Raguel the Midianite, father-in-law of Moses: Setting forward, are we unto the place of which Yahweh hath said, The same, will I give unto you,—Oh come with us and we will do thee good, for, Yahweh, hath spoken good, concerning Israel.

30. And he said unto him, I will not go,—but unto my own land, and unto my own kindred, will I go.

31. Then said he: I beseech thee, do not forsake us,—for, on this account, hast thou come to know of our encamping in the desert, so shalt thou be unto us as eyes;

32. and it shall be if thou wilt go with us,—yea it shall be that with the very good wherewith Yahweh shall do us good, will we do good unto thee.

33. So then they went forward, from the mountain of Yahweh, a journey of three days,—and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, was going before them a journey of three days, to search out for them a resting-place,

34. And the cloud of Yahweh, was over them by day,—when they set forward out of the camp.

35. And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said: Arise, O Yahweh! and scattered be thy foes, Let them that hate thee flee before thee;

36. But when it rested, he said,—Return, O Yahweh! unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel.  

## Numbers 11

1. And it came to pass that when the people were giving themselves up to murmuring, it was grievous in the ears of Yahweh,—so Yahweh hearkened, and kindled was his anger, and the fire of Yahweh burned among them, and consumed the uttermost part of the camp.

2. Then did the people make outcry unto Moses,—and Moses prayed unto Yahweh, and the fire sank down.

3. So he called the name of that place, Taberah [="A Burning"] because there burned among them the fire of Yahweh. 

4.  Moreover the mixed multitude that was in their midst concealed not their lusting,—and so even the sons of Israel, fell away and wept, and said: Who will grant us to eat flesh?

5. We remember the fish that we did eat in Egypt, without money,—the cucumbers, and the water-melons, and the leeks and the onions, and the garlick.

6. But, now, our soul is dried up, there is nothing at all,—unless, unto the manna, [we turn] our eyes.

7. Now, the manna, was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof like the appearance of bdellium,

8. The people used to go about and pick it up, and grind it with a pair of mill-stones, or pound it in a mortar, and boil it in a pot, and make it into round cakes,—then was the taste thereof like the taste of a sweet cake made with oil.

9. When the dew came down upon the camp by night, the manna came down thereupon.

10. So then Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the entrance of his tent,—then kindled the anger of Yahweh fiercely, and in the eyes of Moses, it was grievous.

11. And Moses said unto Yahweh—Wherefore hast thou let thy servant come to grief, and wherefore have I not found favour in thine eyes,—that thou shouldest lay the burden of all this people upon me?

12. Did, I, conceive all this people, or, I, beget them,—that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father carrieth a suckling, unto the soil which thou didst swear unto their fathers?

13. Whence should, I, have flesh to give to all this people,—for they keep weeping by me saying, Oh give us flesh that we may eat!

14. Unable, am, I, by myself, to carry all this people,—for they are too heavy for me.

15. But if, in this way, thou art going to deal with me, slay me, I beseech thee, slay, if I have found favour in thine eyes,—and let me not see my grief, 

16.  Then said Yahweh unto Moses—Gather thou unto me seventy men, from among the elders of Israel, of whom thou knowest that they are elders of the people and their overseers,—then shalt thou take them unto the tent of meeting, and they shall station themselves there with thee.

17. Then will I come down, and speak with thee there, and will take of the spirit that is upon thee and put upon them,—and they shall carry, with thee, the burden of the people, and, thou, shalt not carry it by thyself.

18. And, unto the people, shalt thou say: Hallow yourselves by to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh, for ye have wept in the ears of Yahweh saying—Who will grant us to eat flesh? for it was well with us in Egypt,—so then Yahweh will give you flesh and ye shall eat.

19. Not one day, shall ye eat nor two days,—nor five days nor ten days, nor twenty days:

20. for a month of days until it cometh forth out of your nostrils, so shall it become to you a loathsome thing,—because ye have refused Yahweh who is in your midst, and have wept before him, saying, Wherefore now came we forth out of Egypt?

21. And Moses said, Six hundred thousand footmen, are the people in whose midst am, I, yet thou hast said—Flesh, will I give unto them, and they shall eat for a month of days.

22. Shall the flocks and herds, be slaughtered for them, that it may suffice for them? Shall all the fishes of the sea, be gathered together unto them that it may suffice for them?

23. Then said Yahweh unto Moses, Shall the hand of Yahweh, fail? Now, shalt thou see whether my word come to pass unto thee or not. 

24.  And Moses went forth and spake unto the people the words of Yahweh,—and gathered together seventy men from among the elders of the people, and caused them to stand round about the tent.

25. Then Yahweh came down, in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave unto the seventy men—the elders. And it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and then did so no more.

26. Now there were two men left behind in the camp—the name of the one, was Eldad and the name of the other, Medad, so then the spirit, rested on them—they, being among them who were written, though they had not gone forth unto the tent,—but they prophesied in the camp.

27. And there ran a young man, and told Moses and said,—Eldad and Medad, are prophesying in the camp!

28. Then responded Joshua son of Nun the attendant of Moses from his youth, and said,—My lord Moses forbid them!

29. But Moses said unto him, Art, thou, jealous for, me? Oh would that, all the people of Yahweh, were prophets! Yea let Yahweh put his spirit upon them!

30. Then was Moses received back into the camp,—he and the elders of Israel. 

31.  Now, a wind, had sprung up, from Yahweh, and cut off quails from the sea, and let them lie over the camp—as it were a days journey here and a days journey there, round about the camp,—and as it were two cubits on the face of the land.

32. And the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day, and gathered the quails, he that did least, gathered ten homers,—and they spread them out for themselves spreading away, round about the camp.

33. The flesh, was yet between their teeth, not yet chewed,—when the anger of Yahweh, had kindled upon the people, and Yahweh smote the people, with an exceeding great plague.

34. And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah—because there, they buried the people who had lusted,

35. From Kibroth-hattaavah, the people set forward to Hazeroth,—and they remained in Hazeroth.  

## Numbers 12

1. And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, on account of the Cushite woman whom he had taken,—for, a Cushite woman, had he taken.

2. And they said: Is it only and solely with Moses, that Yahweh hath spoken? With us also, hath he not spoken? And Yahweh heard it.

3. Now, the man Moses, was patient, exceedingly,—above all the sons of earth, who were on the face of the ground. 

4.  Then said Yahweh suddenly, unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three went out.

5. Then Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent,—and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both went forth.

6. Then said he Hear, I beseech you my words. When ye have your prophet, As Yahweh in a vision, will I make myself known, unto him; In a dream, will I speak with him.

7. Not so, my servant Moses,—In all my house, trusty, is he:

8. Mouth to mouth, do I speak with him And plainly—not in dark sayings, And the form of Yahweh, doth he discern,—Wherefore then, were ye not afraid to speak against my servant—against Moses?

9. And the anger of Yahweh kindled upon them and he departed. 

10.  And, when, the cloud, removed from off the tent,—lo! Miriam, leprous, like snow! And Aaron turned unto Miriam and lo! …leprous!

11. Then said Aaron unto Moses,—Oh my lord, do not I beseech thee lay upon us sin, although we have made ourselves foolish, and although we have sinned.

12. Let her not, I beseech thee, remain like the still-born,—which when it is born of its mother, the half of its flesh is consumed.

13. Then Moses made outcry unto Yahweh, saying,—O GOD, I beseech thee grant healing. I beseech thee unto her.

14. And Yahweh said unto Moses: If, her own father, had, but spat, in her face, would she not, have acknowledged the shame for seven days? Let her shut herself up for seven days, outside the camp, and afterwards, let her be received back.

15. So Miriam shut herself up, outside the camp, for seven days,—and, the people, set not forward, until Miriam had been received back.

16. Then afterwards, did the people set forward from Hazeroth, and encamped in the desert of Paran.  

## Numbers 13

1. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

2. Send for thee men and let them spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving unto the sons of Israel,—one man each for the tribe of his fathers, shalt thou send, each one a prince among them.

3. So then Moses sent them out of the desert of Paran, at the bidding of Yahweh,—all of them, great men, heads of the sons of Israel, were they.

4. And, these, are their names,—Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, son of Zaccur;

5. Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat, son of Hori;

6. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb, son of Jephunneh;

7. Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal, son of Joseph;

8. Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea, son of Nun;

9. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti, son of Raphu;

10. Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel, son of Sodi;

11. Of the tribe of Joseph—of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi;

12. Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel, son of Gemalli;

13. Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur, son of Michael;

14. Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi, son of Vophsi;

15. Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel, son of Machi.

16. These, are the names of the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land,—but Moses called Hoshea son of Nun, Joshua.

17. So Moses sent them, to spy out the land of Canaan,—and said unto them—Go up, here in the South, Yea ye shall go up the mountain;

18. And shall see the land, what it is,—And the people that dwell thereupon, Whether they are, strong, or weak, Whether they are, few or many;

19. And what, the land, is, wherein they dwell, Whether it is, good, or, bad,—And the cities within which they dwell, Whether in camps or in strongholds;

20. And what the land is, Whether, fat, or, lean, Whether there is timber therein or is not, Then shall ye pluck up courage and take of the fruit of the land. Now the days, were the days of the first-fruits of grapes. 

21.  So they went up, and spied out the land,—from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob at the entering in of Hamath.

22. Yea they went up in the South and entered as far as Hebron, and there, were Ahiman Sheshai and Talmai descendants of the Anak. Now, Hebron, was built seven years, before Zoan of Egypt.

23. And they entered as far as the ravine of Eschol, and cut down, from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and bare it on a pole between two,—also of the pomegranates and of the figs.

24. That place, was called, The Ravine of Eschol [="Cluster-ravine"]—on account of the cluster, which was cut down from thence by the sons of Israel.

25. And they returned from spying out the land,—at the end of forty days. 

26.  So they took their journey, and came in unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto all the assembly of the sons of Israel into the wilderness of Paran, towards Kadesh,—and brought back word—unto them and unto all the assembly, and showed them the fruit of the land.

27. And they recounted unto him, and said, We entered into the land whither thou didst send us, and surely it doth flow with milk and honey, and, this, is the fruit thereof.

28. Nevertheless surely mighty, are the people that dwell in the land,—and, the cities, walled in, exceeding great, moreover also, the descendants of the Anak, saw we there.

29. Amalek, dwelleth in the land of the South; And, the Hittite, and the Jebusite and the Amorite, dwell in the mountain And the Canaanite, dwelleth by the sea, and by the side of the Jordan.

30. And Caleb stilled the people unto Moses,—and said unto them—Let us go straight up, and possess it, for we shall, surely prevail, against it.

31. But the men who went up with him said, We cannot go up against the people,—for stronger, are they than we.

32. So they sent forth a rumour of the land which they had spied out, among the sons of Israel, saying,—As touching the land through which we passed to spy it out, it is, land that eateth up them who dwell therein, And all the people that we saw in the midst thereof, were men of great stature.

33. And, there, saw we the giants, sons of Anak [descended] of the giants,—And we were in our own eyes, as grass-hoppers, And, so, were we in their eyes.  

## Numbers 14

1. Then did all the assembly lift up, and give forth their voice,—and the people wept throughout that night.

2. And all the sons of Israel, murmured against Moses and against Aaron,—and all the assembly said unto them—Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt, Or in this wilderness, oh that we had died!

3. Wherefore then is Yahweh bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and little ones, will become a prey! Would it not be well for us to go back towards Egypt?

4. And they said, one to another,—Let us appoint a head and let us go back towards Egypt. 

5.  Then did Moses and Aaron fall upon their faces,—before all the convocation of the assembly of the sons of Israel.

6. But, Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, of them who spied out the land, rent their clothes;

7. and spake unto all the assembly of the sons of Israel, saying,—As for the land through which we passed to spy it out, Good, is the land, exceedingly,

8. If Yahweh delight in us, then will he bring us into this land, and give it unto us,—A land which doth flow with milk and honey.

9. Only against Yahweh, do not rebel. Do not, ye, fear the people of the land, For our food, they are,—Their shade hath departed, from over them. And Yahweh is with us, Do not fear them!

10. But when all the assembly bade stone them with stones, the glory of Yahweh, appeared, in the tent of meeting, unto all the sons of Israel. 

11.  Then said Yahweh unto Moses How long! must this people, despise me? And how long can they not believe in me. in view of all the signs which I have done in their midst?

12. Let me smite them with pestilence, and disinherit them,—And make thee into a nation greater and more mighty than they!

13. Then said Moses unto Yahweh,—So shall the Egyptians hear, For thou hast brought up. in thy might, this people out of their midst;

14. And will tell it unto the inhabitants of this land: They have heard, That, thou, Yahweh, art in the midst of this people,—That eye to eye, is he seen—thou, Yahweh, And thy cloud, is standing over them, And in a pillar of cloud, thou thyself, art going on before them by day, And in a pillar of fire, by night.

15. As soon, therefore, as thou hast put to death this people as one man, so soon will the nations who have heard thy fame speak saying:

16. Because Yahweh, was not able, to bring in this people into the land which he had sworn unto them, therefore did he slay them in the desert.

17. Now, therefore, I beseech thee let the might of My Lord, be magnified,—according as thou didst speak saying:

18. Yahweh—slow to anger and great in lovingkindness, Forgiving iniquity and transgression: Though he will not leave, wholly unpunished, Visiting the iniquity of fathers upon sons, Upon a third generation, and upon a fourth.

19. Pardon I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, According to the greatness of thy lovingkindness,—And according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even thus far. 

20.  And Yahweh said, I have pardoned according to thy word;

21. Nevertheless as I live,—and that all the earth may be filled with the glory of Yahweh,

22. Verily, none of the men who have been beholding my glory and my signs, which I have done in Egypt and in the desert,—and have put me to the proof these ten times, and have not hearkened unto my voice,

23. shall see the land, which I sware to their fathers,—yea, none of my despisers, shall see it.

24. But my servant Caleb—because there was another spirit with him, and he followed me fully, therefore will I bring him into the land whereinto he entered, and his seed, shall possess it.

25. Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites, are dwelling in the valley,—to-morrow, turn ye away; and set yourselves forward towards the desert by the way of the Red Sea.

26. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:

27. How long, as regardeth this evil assembly, are they to be murmuring against me? The murmuring of the sons of Israel which, they, have been murmuring against me, have I heard,

28. Say unto them: As I live, is the oracle of Yahweh: Surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so, will I do unto you:—

29. In this desert, shall your dead bodies fall And none of you who were numbered in all your counting, from twenty years old and upwards,—who have murmured against me,

30. none of you, shall enter into the land, as to which I uplifted my hand to give you an abode therein,—save Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun:

31. whereas, your little ones, of whom ye said, they should become, a prey, I will bring them in, and they shall acknowledge the land which ye refused.

32. But, your own dead bodies, shall fall in this desert;

33. and your sons, shall be shepherds in the desert forty years, and shall bear your unchastities,—until your dead bodies are consumed in the desert.

34. By the number of the days wherein ye spied out the land—forty days, each day for a year, shall they bear your iniquities—forty years,—so shall ye know my opposition.

35. I—Yahweh, have spoken, Verily this, will I do to all this evil assembly, who have conspired against me,—In this desert, shall they be consumed And there, shall they die. 

36.  Now as for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land,—who returned and caused all the assembly to murmur against him by giving out a rumour against the land,

37. they died—the men who gave out an evil rumour of the land,—by the plague, before Yahweh.

38. But, Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh! remained alive—of those men who went to spy out the land.

39. And Moses spake these words unto all the sons of Israel, and the people were greatly depressed.

40. So they arose early in the morning, and went up into the top of the mountain, saying,—We are here—therefore will we go up into the place as to which Yahweh hath said that we have sinned.

41. But Moses said, Wherefore is it that, ye, are going beyond the bidding of Yahweh,—since that cannot prosper?

42. Do not go up, For Yahweh is not in your midst,—Lest ye be smitten down before your enemies.

43. For, the Amalekites and the Canaanites, are there before you, So shall ye fall by the sword,—For inasmuch as ye have turned back from following Yahweh, Therefore will Yahweh not be with you.

44. But they presumptuously ascended into the top of the mountain,—though, neither, the ark of the covenant of Yahweh nor Moses moved out of the midst of the camp.

45. So ten the Amalekites and the Canaanites, that dwelt in that mountain, came down,—and smote them and routed them even unto Hormah.  

## Numbers 15

1. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shall say unto them,—When ye shall enter into the land of your dwelling-places, which, I, am giving unto you;

3. and ye would offer, as an altar-flame unto Yahweh an ascending-offering or a sacrifice, for celebrating a vow or as a freewill-offering, or in your appointed seasons,—by way of offering a satisfying odour unto Yahweh, from the herd or from the flock,

4. then shall he that bringeth near his oblation bring near unto Yahweh a meal-offering, of fine meal a tenth part [of an ephah] overflowed with the fourth part of a hin of oil;

5. wine also for a drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou offer with the ascending-offering or with the sacrifice,—for each he-lamb.

6. Or, with a ram, thou shalt offer a meal-offering, of fine meal, two tenths,—overflowed with oil, the third of a hin;

7. wine also, for a drink-offering, the third of a hin, shalt thou bring near as a satisfying odour unto Yahweh.

8. And when thou wouldest offer a choice young bullock as an ascending-offering or sacrifice,—for celebrating a vow or as a peace-offering unto Yahweh,

9. then shall he bring near with his choice young bullock, a meal-offering, of fine meal three tenths,—overflowed with half a hin of oil;

10. wine also, shalt thou bring near for a drink-offering, half a hin,—for an altar-flame of satisfying odour unto Yahweh.

11. Thus and thus, shall it be done, for each ox, and for each ram,—and for each young one among the sheep, or among the goats:

12. according to the number which ye shall offer, thus and thus, shall ye do for each one according to their number.

13. Every one born in the land, thus and thus, shall offer these things,—when bringing near an altar-flame of a satisfying odour unto Yahweh.

14. And when there shall sojourn with you a sojourner, or one who is in your midst to your generations, and he would offer an altar-flame of a satisfying odour unto Yahweh, as ye offer, so, shall he offer,

15. In the convocation, one statute, shall there be for you and for the sojourner who sojourneth,—an age-abiding statute unto your generations, as ye are, so, the sojourner, shall be before Yahweh:

16. one law and one regulation, shall there be for yourselves and for the sojourner that sojourneth with you.

17. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

18. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—When ye enter into the land whereinto I, am bringing you,

19. then shall it be, when ye eat the bread of the land, that ye shall heave up a heave-offering unto Yahweh.

20. Of the first of your meal, shall ye heave up, a cake, as a heave-offering,—like the heave-offering of grain, so shall ye heave it.

21. Of the first of your meal, shall ye give unto Yahweh a heave-offering,—unto your generations. 

22.  And when ye shall make a mistake, and not observe all these commandments,—which Yahweh hath spoken unto Moses;

23. even all that Yahweh hath given unto you in command, by the hand of Moses,—from the day that Yahweh gave command, and onward unto your generations,

24. then shall it be—if, any from the eyes of the assembly, it hath been done by mistake, that all the assembly shall offer one choice young bullock for an ascending-sacrifice as a satisfying odour unto Yahweh, with the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offering thereof, according to the regulation,—and one young he-goat as a sin-bearer.

25. So shall the priest put a propitiatory, covering over all the assembly of the sons of Israel and pardon shall be granted unto them,—because a mistake, it was, they, therefore have brought in their offering—an altar-flame unto Yahweh and their sin-bearer before Yahweh for their mistake:

26. and pardon shall be granted unto all the assembly of the sons of Israel and unto the sojourner that sojourneth in their midst,—for, in the case of all the people, it was, by mistake.

27. And if, any one person, shall sin by mistake, then shall he bring near a she-goat of the first year as a sin-bearer;

28. and the priest shall put a propitiatory-covering over the person who hath made the mistake, when he hath sinned by mistake before Yahweh, even put a propitiatory-covering over him, and pardon shall be granted him.

29. For the native born among the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner that sojourneth in their midst, one law, shall there be unto you—for acting by mistake. 

30.  But, as for the person who acteth with a high hand—of the native born or of the sojourners, Yahweh himself, he, reproacheth,—therefore shall that person be cut off out of the midst of his people.

31. Because the word of Yahweh, hath he despised, and his commandment, hath he broken, that person shall be surely cut off, his iniquity, is in himself.

32. While the sons of Israel were in the desert, they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day.

33. And they who found him gathering sticks, brought him near, unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto all the assembly.

34. And they put him in ward,—because it was not clear what they should do unto him.

35. Then said Yahweh unto Moses, The man shall be, put to death,—all the assembly, stoning him with stones, outside the camp.

36. So then all the assembly, put him forth, outside the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died,—As Yahweh commanded Moses. 

37.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:

38. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, That they shall make them fringes on the corners of their garments unto their generations—and shall put upon the fringe of the corner a cord of blue:

39. so shall they serve you as fringes, and when ye see then, then shall ye call to mind all the commandments of Yahweh, and shall do them,—and shall not spy out, after your own hearts, and after your own eyes for things, after which, ye, are ready to go unchastely away:

40. to the intent ye may call to mind, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.

41. I—Yahweh, am your God—who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to become your God,—I,—Yahweh, am your God.  

## Numbers 16

1. Then took Korah, son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi,—and Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On, son of Peleth sons of Reuben;

2. and rose up before Moses, with certain men of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty,—princes of assembly, called to the stated meeting, men of renown;

3. and gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them Too much for you, when, all the assembly, are, all of them, holy, and in the midst of them, is Yahweh,—Wherefore, then, should ye set yourselves up, above the convocation of Yahweh?

4. And, when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face.

5. Then spake he unto Korah, and unto all his assembly, saying, In the morning, will Yahweh make known who are his, and who is the holy one and will cause him to come near unto himself,—yea him whom he shall choose, will he cause to come near unto himself.

6. This do,—Take to you censers, Korah and all his assembly;

7. and place therein fire, and put thereon incense before Yahweh, to-morrow, So shall it be—that, the man whom Yahweh shall choose, he shall be the holy one. Too much for you ye sons of Levi!

8. And Moses said unto Korah,—Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi!

9. Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the assembly of Israel, to bring you near unto himself,—to do the laborious work of the habitation of Yahweh, and to stand before the assembly, to wait upon them?

10. But having brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee, must ye seek priesthood also?

11. Wherefore thou and all thine assembly, are conspiring against Yahweh,—But Aaron, what is he, that ye should murmur against him? 

12.  Then sent Moses, to call for Dathan and for Abiram sons of Eliab,—and they said We will not come up:

13. Was it, a small thing, that thou didst bring us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to put us to death in the desert but thou must, continue even to lord it, over us?

14. Certainly not into a land flowing with milk and honey, hast thou brought us, nor given unto us an inheritance of field and vineyard,—The eyes of those men, wilt thou dig out? We will not come up.

15. Then was Moses very angry, and he said unto Yahweh, Do not thou have respect unto their meal-offering. Not one ass, from them, have I taken, neither have I wronged one of them.

16. And Moses said unto Korah, Thou, and all thine assembly, come ye before Yahweh,—thou, and they, and Aaron to-morrow.

17. And take ye each man his censer and put thereon incense, then shall ye bring near before Yahweh, each man his censer, two hundred and fifty Censers,—and, thou and Aaron, each man his censer.

18. So they took each man his censer and put thereon fire, and placed thereon incense,—and took their stand at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.

19. And Korah gathered together against them all the assembly, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting,—then appeared the glory of Yahweh, unto all the assembly.

20. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:

21. Separate yourselves out of the midst of this assembly,—that I may consume them in a moment.

22. And they fell upon their faces and said, O GOD, the God of the spirits of all flesh,—shall, one man, sin, and against all the assembly, wilt thou be wroth. 

23.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying,

24. Speak unto the assembly, saying,—Get ye up from round about the habitation of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.

25. So Moses rose up, and went, unto Dathan and Abiram,—then went, after him the elders of Israel.

26. And he spake unto the assembly, saying—Remove I pray you from beside the tents of these lawless men, and do not touch aught that pertaineth unto them,—lest ye be carried off, in all their sins.

27. So they went up from beside the habitation of Korah, Dathan and Abiram on every side,—and, Dathan and Abiram, came out and stationed themselves at the entrance of their tents, with their wives and their sons and their little ones.

28. Then said Moses, Hereby, shall ye know, that, Yahweh hath sent me, to do all these works,—verily, not out of my own heart:

29. If, as all human beings die, these do die, and the visitation of all human beings, be visited upon them, Yahweh, hath not sent me.

30. But, if, a creation, Yahweh create, and the ground open wide her mouth and swallow them up, with all that pertain unto them, and so they go down alive unto hades, then shall ye know, that these men have despised Yahweh.

31. And it came to pass as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground which was under them, clave asunder;

32. and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up them, and their households,—and all the human beings who pertained unto Korah, with all their goods:

33. so, they, and all that pertained unto them, went down, alive unto hades,—and the earth, closed upon them, and they perished out of the midst of the convocation.

34. And, all Israel who were round about them, fled at their cry,—for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up. 

35.  Fire also came forth, from Yahweh,—and consumed the two hundred and fifty men, who offered the incense.

36. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

37. Say unto Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the midst of the burning, and the fire, scatter thou yonder,—for they have been hallowed.

38. As for the censers of these sinners against their own persons, they shall be made into beaten-out plates as an overlay for the altar, for they had brought them near before Yahweh and hallowed them,—so shall they become a sign unto the sons of Israel.

39. And Eleazar the priest took the censers of bronze, which the consumed men had brought near,—and beat them out into plates for overlaying the altar:

40. a memorial unto the sons of Israel, That no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, shall draw near to offer incense before Yahweh,—lest he become like Korah and like his assembly, As spake Yahweh by the hand of Moses with regard thereto. 

41.  And all the assembly of the sons of Israel murmured, on the morrow, against Moses and against, Aaron, saying,—Ye, have caused the death of the people of Yahweh.

42. And it came to pass, when the assembly gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, that they turned towards the tent of meeting, and lo! the cloud had covered it: and the glory of Yahweh, appeared.

43. And Moses and Aaron came in, before the tent of meeting.

44. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

45. Lift yourselves up out of the midst of this assembly, that I may consume them, as in a moment,—And they fell upon their faces.

46. Then said Moses unto Aaron—Take the censer and place thereon fire, from off the altar, and put incense [thereon], and, going quickly into the assembly, put a propitiatory-covering over them,—for wrath hath gone forth from before Yahweh the plague, hath begun.

47. Then took Aaron, as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the convocation, and lo! the plague had begun among the people,—so he placed the incense, and put a propitiatory-covering over the people:

48. thus did he take his stand between the dead and the living,—and the plague was restrained.

49. And so it was that they who died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred,—besides them who died over the matter of Korah.

50. And Aaron returned unto Moses, unto the entrance of the tent of meeting,—when, the plague, had been restrained.  

## Numbers 17

1. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel and take of them one staff each for an ancestral house of all their princes, by their ancestral houses, twelve staves,—each man’s name, shalt thou write upon his staff;

3. and, Aaron’s name, shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi,—for, one staff, shall there be for the head of their ancestral house.

4. Then shalt thou lay them up in the tent of meeting,—before the testimony, where I meet with you.

5. So shall it come to pass, that, the man whom I shall choose, his staff, shall bud,—so will I cause to cease from against me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, wherewith they, are murmuring against you.

6. And Moses spake unto the sons of Israel and every one of their princes gave unto him, a staff apiece, for each prince, by their ancestral houses, twelve staves,—and the staff of Aaron, was in the midst of their staves.

7. So Moses laid up the staves before Yahweh,—in the tent of the testimony. 

8.  And it came to pass, on the morrow, that Moses entered into the tent of the testimony; and lo! the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi, had budded,—yea it had brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms, and borne ripe almonds.

9. So then Moses brought forth all the staves, from before Yahweh, unto all the sons of Israel,—and they saw and took, each man his own staff.

10. And Yahweh said unto Moses—Put back the rod of Aaron, before the testimony, to be kept as a sign unto such as are perverse,—that thou mayest bring to an end their murmurings against me that they die not.

11. Thus did Moses,—as Yahweh commanded him, so, did he.

12. Then spake the sons of Israel unto Moses saying: Lo! we have breathed our last—we are lost, we are, all, lost:

13. whosoever draweth near—draweth near—unto the habitation of Yahweh, dieth,—are we ever to have made an end of breathing our last?  

## Numbers 18

1. And Yahweh said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and the house of thy father with thee, shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary,—and, thou, and thy sons with thee, shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

2. Therefore also thy brethren of the tribe of Levi the stem of thy father, bring thou near with thee, and let them be joined unto thee, and let them wait upon thee,—both on thee and on thy sons with thee, before the tent of the testimony.

3. So shall they keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tent,—only, unto the vessels of the sanctuary, and unto the altar, shall they not come near, lest they die—both they, and ye.

4. So shall they be joined unto thee, and shall keep the charge of the tent of meeting, as to all the laborious work of the tent,—but a stranger, shall not come near unto you.

5. So shall ye keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar,—that there no more be wrath against the sons of Israel.

6. I, therefore, lo! I have taken your brethren the Levites, out of the midst of the sons of Israel,—unto you, as a gift are they given, unto Yahweh, to do the laborious work of the tent of meeting.

7. But thou and thy sons with thee, shall keep the charge of your priesthood, as to every matter of the altar and as to the interior of the veil, and shall do the laborious work, as a laborious service of gifts, do I give your priesthood, and, the stranger who cometh near shall be put to death. 

8.  And Yahweh spake unto Aaron, I, therefore, lo! I have given unto thee the charge of my heave-offerings,—as to all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel—unto thee, have I given them. as pertaining to the anointing, and unto thy sons. for a statute age-abiding,

9. This, shall be thine, out of the things most holy, out of the fire,—their every oblation—to the extent of their every meal-offering, and their every sin-bearer, and their every guilt-bearer wherewith they make amends unto me, most holy unto thee, shall it be and unto thy sons.

10. As something most holy, shall ye eat it,—every male, shall eat it, holy, shall it be unto thee.

11. This, therefore, shall be thine—the heave-offering of their gift even all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel, unto thee, have I given them and unto thy sons and unto thy daughters with thee by a statute age-abiding,—every one that is clean in thy house, shall eat it.

12. All the best of oil, and all the best of new-wine and corn,—the firstfruits thereof which they shall give unto Yahweh, unto thee, have I given them.

13. The firstfruits of all that is in their land which they shall bring in unto Yahweh, thine, shall it be,—every one that is clean in thy house, shall eat it:

14. every devoted thing in Israel, thine, shall it be:

15. every thing that is born first of all flesh that may be offered unto Yahweh among men and among beasts, shall be thine,—only thou shalt, redeem, the firstborn of men, and the firstborn of unclean beasts, shalt thou redeem.

16. And, as to the redemption price thereof, from a month old, shalt thou redeem, by thine estimate five shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary,—twenty gerahs, it is.

17. Only a firstling ox or a firstling sheep or a firstling goat, shalt thou not redeem, hallowed, they are,—their blood, shalt thou dash against the altar and of their fat, shalt thou make a perfume, an altar-flame, for a satisfying odour unto Yahweh:

18. and their flesh, shall be thine,—as the wave-breast and as the right leg, thine, shall it be:

19. all the heave-offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel shall heave up unto Yahweh, have I given unto thee and unto thy sons and unto thy daughters with thee by a statute age-abiding,—an age-abiding covenant of salt, it is before Yahweh, for thee and for thy seed with thee. 

20.  Then said Yahweh unto Aaron: In their land, thou shalt have no inheritance, and no allotted portion, shalt thou have in their midst,—I, am thine allotted portion and thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.

21. And unto the sons of Levi, lo! I have given all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance,—the allotted portion for their laborious work which, they are performing, the laborious work of the tent of meeting:

22. that the sons of Israel come near no more, unto the tent of meeting,—to bear sin, to die.

23. So shall the Levites themselves perform the laborious work of the tent of meeting, and, they, shall bear their iniquity, a statute age-abiding, unto your generations, and in the midst of the sons of Israel, shall they take no inheritance.

24. Because the tenth of the sons of Israel which they shall offer up unto Yahweh as a heave-offering, have I given unto the Levites as an inheritance,—for this cause, said I regarding them, In the midst of the sons of Israel, shall they take no inheritance.

25. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

26. Unto the Levites, therefore shalt thou speak and shalt say unto them, When ye shall take of the sons of Israel the tenth which I have given unto you from them as your inheritance, then shall ye offer up therefrom the heave-offering of Yahweh, a tenth of the tenth.

27. So shall your heave-offering be reckoned your own,—as corn out of the threshing-floor, and as the abundance out of the wine-press.

28. Thus, shall ye also, offer up the heave-offering of Yahweh, out of all your tenths which ye shall take from the sons of Israel,—and give therefrom the heave-offering of Yahweh, unto Aaron the priest.

29. Out of all your gifts, shall ye offer up every heave-offering of Yahweh,—out of all the best thereof, the hallowed pert thereof out of it.

30. And thou shalt say unto them,—When ye offer the best thereof out of it, then shall it be reckoned to belong unto the Levites, as the increase of the threshing-floor and as the increase of the wine-press,

31. And ye shall eat it in any place, ye, and your household,—for a reward, it is unto you, the allotted portion for your laborious work in the tent of meeting.

32. And ye shall not by reason of it bear sin, when ye offer up the best thereof, out of it; and the hallowed things of the sons of Israel, shall ye not profane neither shall ye die.  

## Numbers 19

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:

2. This, is the statute of the law, which Yahweh hath commanded, saying,—Speak unto the sons of Israel—That they bring unto thee a red heifer, without defect wherein is no blemish, and whereupon hath come no yoke.

3. Then shall ye give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall take her forth unto the outside of the camp, and she shall be slain before him;

4. and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,—and shall sprinkle towards the front of the tent of meeting: of her blood, seven times;

5. and the heifer shall be burned up before his eyes,—her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung shall be burned up.

6. Then shall the priest take cedar-wood and hyssop and crimson,—and cast into the midst of the burning up of the heifer.

7. And the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterwards come into the camp,—but the priest shall be unclean until the evening,

8. And, he that burneth her, shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water,—and be unclean until the evening,

9. Then shall a man that is clean gather up the ashes of the heifer, and put them by, outside the camp, in a clean place,—so shall they be for the assembly of the sons of Israel to keep for water of separation it is a taking away of sin.

10. Then shall he that gathered up the ashes wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening,—so shall it be for the sons of Israel and for the sojourner that sojourneth in your midst by a statute age-abiding. 

11.  He that toucheth the dead, even any human person, shall be unclean seven days.

12. He, shall cleanse himself from sin therewith on the third day, then on the seventh day, shall he be clean,—but if he cleanse not himself from sin on the third day, then on the seventh day, shall he not be clean,

13. Whosoever toucheth the dead the person of the human being that dieth and doth not cleanse himself from sin, the habitation of Yahweh, hath he made unclean; that person therefore shall be cut off out of Israel,—because, the water of separation, was not dashed upon him, unclean, shall he be, his uncleanness is yet upon him.

14. This, is the law—When, a human being, shall die in a tent, every one who goeth into the tent and every one who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.

15. And, in the case of every open vessel, on which no cover is fastened, unclean, it is.

16. And, whosoever toucheth on the face of the field, one slain with a sword, or one who hath died, or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

17. And they shall take, for him that is unclean, of the ashes of the burning of the sin-bearer,—and living water shall be put thereon in a vessel,

18. Then shall a man that is clean take hyssop, and dip in the water, and sprinkle upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons who were there,—and upon him that touched the bone or him who had been slain, or him who had died of himself or the grave;

19. and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean, on the third day, and on the seventh day,—so shall he cleanse himself from sin, on the seventh day, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water and be clean in the evening.

20. But in the case of the man who shall be unclean and shall not cleanse himself from sin, that person shall be cut off, out of the midst of the convocation,—for, the sanctuary of Yahweh, hath he made unclean, the water of separation, hath not been dashed upon him unclean, he is.

21. So shall it be unto them for statute age-abiding,—and, he that sprinkleth the water of separation, shall wash his clothes, and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until the evening;

22. and, whatsoever the unclean person toucheth, shall be unclean,—and the person who toucheth it shall be unclean until the evening.  

## Numbers 20

1. Then came the sons of Israel the whole assembly, into the desert of Zin in the first month, and the people dwelt in Kadesh,—and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

2. And there was no water for the assembly,—so they gathered together against Moses and against Aaron.

3. And the people contended with Moses,—and spake saying, Would then we had died when our brethren died, before Yahweh!

4. Wherefore then hast thou brought the convocation of Yahweh into this desert,—to die there, we, and our cattle?

5. And wherefore did ye cause us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us into this wretched place?—not a place of seeds, and figs, and vines and pomegranates, even water, is there none to drink.

6. And Moses and Aaron went in from the presence of the multitude unto the entrance of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces,—and the glory of Yahweh appeared unto them.

7. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

8. Take the staff and gather together the assembly, thou, and Aaron thy brother, then shall ye speak unto the cliff before their eyes and it shall give forth its waters,—so shalt thou bring forth unto them water, out of the cliff, and shalt cause the assembly, and their cattle to drink.

9. And Moses took the staff from before Yahweh,—as he commanded him.

10. And Moses and Aaron gathered together the convocation before the cliff,—and he said unto them: Hear I pray you ye rebels! Out of this cliff, must we bring forth for you water?

11. And Moses lifted high his hand and smote the cliff with his staff, twice,—and there came forth water in abundance, and the assembly and their cattle, did drink.

12. Then said Yahweh unto Moses and unto Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to hallow me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore, shall ye not bring in this convocation into the land which I have given unto them.

13. The same, were the waters of Meribah [that is "Contention"] in that the sons of Israel contended with Yahweh,—and so he hallowed himself among them. 

14.  And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh, unto the king of Edom,—Thus, saith thy brother Israel, Thou thyself, knowest all the distress which befell us;

15. and how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we abode in Egypt, many days, and that the Egyptians ill-treated us, and our fathers;

16. and we made outcry unto Yahweh, and he heard our voice, and sent a messenger, and brought us forth out of Egypt,—lo! then, we, are in Kadesh, a city at the extremity of thy boundary,

17. Let us, we pray thee, pass through thy land—we will not pass through field or vineyard, nor will we drink the waters of a well,—by the king’s road, will we go—we will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left, until we get through thy boundary.

18. And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through my land,—lest with the sword, I come out to meet thee.

19. And the sons of Israel said unto him—By the highway, will we go up, and if thy waters, we should drink—I, and my cattle then would I give the price thereof,—only—it is nothing!—with my feet, would I pass through.

20. And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out to meet him, with a strong people, and with a firm hand.

21. Thus did Edom refuse to give Israel passage through his boundary,—and Israel turned away from him. 

22.  Then set they forward from Kadesh,—and the sons of Israel. all the assembly, came in to Mount Hor.

23. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses and unto Aaron in Mount Hor,—near the boundary of the land of Edom saying:

24. Aaron shall be withdrawn unto his kinsfolk, for he shall not enter into the land. which I have given unto the sons of Israel,—because ye spurned my bidding, at the waters of Meribah.

25. Take thou Aaron, and Eleazar his son,—and bring them up Mount Hor;

26. and strip thou Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son,—and, Aaron, shall be withdrawn and shall die there.

27. And Moses did as Yahweh commanded,—and they went up into, Mount Hor, in sight of all the assembly.

28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar his son, and Aaron died there, in the top of the mount,—and Moses and Eleazar came down out of the mount.

29. And all the assembly saw that Aaron was dead; and they bewailed Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.  

## Numbers 21

1. And the Canaanite, the king of Arad who dwelt in the South, heard that Israel had entered by the way of Atharim,—so he made war with Israel, and took some of them captive.

2. Then Israel vowed vow unto Yahweh, and said,—If thou wilt, surely deliver up, this people into my hand, then will I utterly destroy their cities.

3. And Yahweh hearkened unto the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanite into his hand, so he utterly destroyed them, and their cities, and called the name of the place Hormah [that is, "Utter Destruction"]. 

4.  Then brake they up from Mount Hor, by way of the Red Sea, to go round the land of Edom,—and the soul of the people became impatient because of the way,

5. So then the people spake against God and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt, to die in the desert? for there is neither bread nor water, and our soul, doth loathe this contemptible bread!

6. And Yahweh sent among the people the poisonous serpents, and they bit the people,—and much people out of Israel died.

7. Then came the people of Israel unto Moses and said—We have sinned in that we spake against Yahweh and against thee, Pray thou unto Yahweh, that he may take from us the serpent. So Moses prayed for the people.

8. Then said Yahweh unto Moses—Make thee a like serpent, and put it upon standard,—and it shall come to pass, that, any one who is bitten, as soon as he seeth it, shall live.

9. So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon the standard,—and it came to pass—that if the serpent had bitten any man, as soon as he directed his look unto the serpent of bronze, he lived. 

10.  And the sons of Israel brake up,—and encamped in Oboth.

11. And they brake up from Oboth,—and encamped in Ije-Abarim, in the desert which is over against Moab, towards the rising of the sun.

12. From thence, brake they up,—and encamped in the ravine of Zered.

13. From thence, brake they up, and encamped on the other side of Arnon which is in the desert, that cometh forth out of the boundary of the Amorites,—for, Arnon, is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

14. For this cause is it said, in the Book of the Wars of Yahweh,— …Waheb with a hurricane, And the ravines of Arnon;

15. And the bottom of the ravines, that extendeth toward the dwelling of Ar,—And adjoineth to the boundary of Moab,

16. And from thence, towards Beer,—the same, is the well whereof Yahweh said unto Moses, Gather together the people, that I may give them water.

17. Then, sang Israel this song,—Spring thou up, O well! Respond ye thereunto;

18. A well!—princes digged it, Nobles of the people, delved it, With a sceptre, With their staves. And, from the desert, to Mattanah;

19. and from Mattanah, to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel, to Bamoth;

20. and, from Bamoth of the valley, which is in the field-country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah,—which overlooketh Jeshimon. 

21.  Then sent Israel messengers, unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying:

22. Let me pass through thy land we will not turn aside into field or into vineyard, nor will we drink the water of a well,—by the king’s road, will we go, until we get through thy boundary.

23. And Sihon suffered not Israel to pass through his boundary, but Sihon gathered together all his people, and came forth to meet Israel, towards the desert, and entered Jahaz, and fought with Israel.

24. And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword,—and took possession of his land, from Arnon unto Jabbok, unto the sons of Ammon, for strong, was the boundary of the sons of Ammon.

25. So Israel took all these cities,—and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all her villages;

26. for, as for Heshbon, the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, it was, he, having fought with the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, unto Arnon.

27. For this cause, say the poets—Enter ye Heshbon,—Built and prepared be the city of Sihon;

28. For, a fire, hath come forth out of Heshbon, A flame, out of the stronghold of Sihon; It hath consumed Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of Arnon.

29. Woe to thee, Moab, Thou art lost, O people of Chemosh,—He hath given up his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto the king of the Amorites, Sihon.

30. Then we shot them—Heshbon is destroyed, as far as Dibon,—Then laid we waste as far as Nophah, A fire reacheth unto Medeba.

31. So then Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

32. And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured the villages thereof,—and dispossessed the Amorites that were there.

33. Then turned they, and went up by the way of Bashan,—and Og, king of Bashan, came forth to meet them—he and all his people, to give battle at Edrei.

34. Then said Yahweh unto Moses—Do not fear him, for into thy hand, have I delivered him and all his people, and his land,—Therefore shalt thou do unto him, as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who was dwelling in Heshbon.

35. So then they smote him and his sons and all his people, until there was not left him a remnant,—and took possession of his land.  

## Numbers 22

1. Then did the sons of Israel break up,—and encamp in the waste plains of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan by Jericho.

2. And Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done unto the Amorites;

3. and Moab shrank with great fear from the presence of the people because, many, they were,—and Moab was alarmed at the presence of the sons of Israel.

4. So Moab said unto the elders of Midian—Now, shall the gathered host lick up all that are round about us, as the ox doth lick up the verdure of the field. But, Balak son of Zippor, was king unto Moab at that time.

5. So he sent messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to Pethor which was by the river of the land of the sons of his people to call him,—saying Lo! a people, hath come forth out of Egypt Lo! he hath covered the eye of the land, Yea he, is tarrying over against me.

6. Now, therefore, do come, I pray thee curse me this people. For stronger, he is than I, If peradventure I prevail, we shall smite him, That I may drive him out of the land,—For I know that, he whom thou dost bless, is to be blessed, And, he whom thou dost curse, is to be cursed.

7. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went their way, with the rewards of divination in their hand,—so they came in unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

8. And he said unto them—Tarry ye here for the night, and I will bring you back word, as Yahweh shall speak unto me. So the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

9. And God came in unto Balaam,—and said, Who are these men with thee?

10. Then said Balaam unto God,—Balak, son of Zippor king of Moab, hath sent unto me:

11. Lo! the people that hath come forth out of Egypt—he covereth the eye of the land. Now, do come, do revile me him, Peradventure I shall prevail in making war with him, And shall drive him out.

12. And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them,—Thou shalt not curse the people, For blessed, he is.

13. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your own land,—For Yahweh hath refused to let me go with you.

14. So the princes of Moab arose, and came in unto Balak,—and said, Balaam refused to come with us. 

15.  Then added Balak again,—to send princes, more and weightier than these.

16. And they came in unto Balaam,—and said unto him—Thus, said Balak son of Zippor, Do not be withheld, I pray thee from coming unto me:

17. For I will honour, thee, exceedingly, and all that thou shalt say unto me, will I do. Do come therefore I pray thee oh revile me this people.

18. And Balaam responded and said unto the servants of Balak, Though Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the bidding of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.

19. Now, therefore abide here, I pray you even ye,—for the night,—that I may get to know what further Yahweh may be speaking with me.

20. And God came in unto Balaam, by night, and said unto him—If, to call thee, the men have come in, arise go with them,—But only, the thing that I shall speak unto thee, that, shalt thou do.

21. So Balaam arose in the morning, and saddled his ass,—and went with the princes of Moab. 

22.  Then kindled the anger of God, because he was going, and the messenger of Yahweh stationed himself in the way, to withstand him,—as he was riding upon his ass, his two young men being with him.

23. And the ass saw the messenger of Yahweh stationed in the road with his drawn sword in his hand, so the ass turned aside out of the road and went into the field,—and Balaam smote the ass, to make her turn back into the road.

24. But the messenger of Yahweh took his stand, in a hollow pass of the vineyards,—with a fence on this side, and a fence on that side.

25. And when the ass saw the messenger of Yahweh, she squeezed herself against the wall, and squeezed the foot of Balaam against the wall,—and again he smote her.

26. And the messenger of Yahweh went on further, and took his stand in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn to the right hand or to the left.

27. And, when the ass saw the messenger of Yahweh, she sank down under Balaam,—then was Balaam’s anger kindled, and he smote the ass with the staff.

28. And Yahweh opened the mouth of the ass,—and she said unto Balaam—What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me, these three times?

29. And Balaam said unto the ass, Surely thou hast been making sport of me,—Would there had been a sword in my hand, for, now, would I have slain thee.

30. Then said the ass unto Balaam—Am not I thine own ass on which thou hast ridden all thy life, until this day? Have I, been wont, to do unto thee, thus? And he said, Nay!

31. Then did Yahweh unveil the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the messenger of Yahweh stationed in the road, with his sword drawn in his hand,—so he bent his head and bowed down before him.

32. And the messenger of Yahweh said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass, these three times? Lo! I, myself, am come forth to withstand thee, because headlong was thy way before me.

33. And the ass hath seen me, and hath turned aside at my presence these three times: Unless she had turned aside from my presence, yea now even thee, had I slain, but, her, had I suffered to live.

34. Then said Balaam unto the messenger of Yahweh—I have sinned, for I knew not, that, thou, wast stationed to meet me in the road,—Now, therefore, if it be displeasing in thine eyes, I must get me back again.

35. And the messenger of Yahweh said unto Balaam—Go with the men: Only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that, shalt thou speak. So Balaam went his way with the princes of Balak. 

36.  And Balak heard that Balaam, was coming,—so he went forth to meet him unto a city of Moab which was upon the boundary of Arnon, which was in the utmost part of the boundary.

37. And Balak said unto Balaam: Did I not, send, unto thee, to call thee? Wherefore didst thou not come unto me? Am I not in very deed, able to honour thee?

38. And Balaam said unto Balak—Lo! I am come unto thee, Now, can, I, possibly, promise anything? The word that God shall put in my mouth, that, must I speak.

39. So Balaam went with Balak,—and they entered Kiriath-huzoth.

40. And Balak sacrificed herd and flock,—and sent unto Balaam, and unto the princes that were with him.

41. And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up the high places of Baal,—and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.  

## Numbers 23

1. Then said Balaam unto Balak: Build me here seven altars,—and prepare me here, seven bullocks and seven rams.

2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken,—and Balak and Balaam caused to ascend a bullock and a ram on each altar.

3. Then said Balaam unto Balak: Station thyself by thine ascending-sacrifice, and let me go my way—peradventure Yahweh may come and meet me, and what thing soever he may show me, I will tell thee. So he went his way to a bare height.

4. And God came unto Balaam,—so he said unto him The seven altars, have I built in a row, and have caused to ascend, bullock and a ram on each altar.

5. And Yahweh put a word into the mouth of Balaam,—and said—Return unto Balak, and, thus, shalt thou speak.

6. So he returned unto him, and lo! he was stationed by his ascending-sacrifice,—he, and all the princes of Moab.

7. So he took up his parable and said,—From Aram, doth Balak conduct me, The king of Moab, from the mountains of the East, Come thou! curse me Jacob, Yea, come thou! rage on Israel.

8. How can I revile one whom GOD hath not reviled? Yea, how can I rage on one on whom Yahweh hath not raged?

9. Surely from the head of the rocks, do I see him, Yea, from the hills, do I observe him,—Lo! a people, who alone doth dwell, And among the nations, he doth not reckon himself.

10. Who hath counted the dust of Jacob? Or who hath numbered the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, And let my hereafter be like his!

11. Then said Balak unto Balaam, What hast thou done for me? To revile mine enemies, I summoned thee, and lo! thou hast kept on blessing.

12. And he answered and said,—Was it not to be so that whatsoever Yahweh should put into my mouth, the same, should I take heed to speak? 

13.  Then said Balak unto him—Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see him, nothing but his utmost part, shalt thou see, but all of him, shalt thou not see,—and so revile me him from thence.

14. And he took him to the field of Zophim, unto the head of Pisgah,—and built seven altars, and caused to ascend a bullock and a ram on each altar.

15. Then said he to Balak, Station thyself here by thine ascending-sacrifice,—while, I, meet him yonder.

16. And Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word into his mouth,—and said—Return unto Balak and thus shalt thou speak.

17. So he came in unto him and, there he was-stationed by his ascending-sacrifice, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Yahweh spoken?

18. Then took he up his parable and said,—Rise, Balak, and hear, Give ear unto me son of Zippor!

19. GOD is, not a man, that he should lie, Nor a son of Adam, that he should repent,—Hath, he, said, and will not perform? Yea spoken, and will not make it stand fast?

20. Lo! to bless, have I received [command],—And I will bless, nor will I take it back.

21. He hath not discovered trouble in Jacob, Neither hath he seen wretchedness in Israel,—Yahweh, his God, is with him, And, the acclaim of a king, in his midst:

22. GOD having brought them forth out of Egypt, The very horns of the buffalo, are his:

23. Surely, there is no enchantment against Jacob, Nor divination against Israel,—Now, shall it be said—Of Jacob and of Israel, What hath GOD wrought!

24. Lo, a people, like a lioness, shall rise, And like a strong lion, shall rouse himself up; He will not lie down till he eat the torn, And the blood of the slain, he drink.

25. Then said Balak unto Balaam, Thou shalt neither revile, him,—nor bless him.

26. And Balaam responded, and said unto Balak,—Spake I not unto thee, saying, All that Yahweh shall speak, that, must I do?

27. And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee! let me take thee unto another place,—peradventure, it may be right in the eyes of God, that thou revile me him. from thence.

28. So Balak took Balaam,—unto the head of Peor, that looketh over the face of the Jeshimon.

29. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here, seven altars,—and prepare me here, seven bullocks and seven rams.

30. And Balak did as Balaam said,—and caused to ascend a bullock and a ram on each altar.  

## Numbers 24

1. And when Balaam saw that it was good in the eyes of Yahweh to bless Israel, he went not as at other times to invoke enchantments,—but set towards the desert, his face.

2. So Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel, dwelling, according to his tribes,—then came upon him the Spirit of God;

3. and he took up his parable, and said,—The oracle of Balaam, son of Beor, Yea the oracle of the man, of opened eye;

4. The oracle of one hearing sayings of GOD, Who the sight of the Almighty, receiveth in vision, Who falleth down but hath unveiled eyes:—

5. How pleasing are thy tents, O Jacob,—Thy habitations, O Israel:

6. Like ravines extended, Like gardens by a river,—Like aloe-trees Yahweh hath planted, Like cedars by waters:

7. He poureth forth water from his buckets, And, his seed, is among many waters,—And taller than Agag is his King, And exalted is his kingdom.

8. GOD having brought him forth out of Egypt, The very horns of the buffalo, are his,—He eateth up nations that assail him And the bones of them, he breaketh And the loins of him, he crusheth:

9. He hath knelt—hath lain down, Like a strong lion, yea like a lioness, Who shall rouse him up? Such as bless thee are each one blessed, But, such, as curse thee, are each one cursed. 

10.  Then kindled the anger of Balak against Balaam, and he smote together his hands,—and Balak said unto Balaam—To revile my foes, I called thee, And lo! thou hast kept on blessing, these three times.

11. Now, therefore, flee thou unto thy place,—I said, I will, highly honour, thee; but lo! Yahweh hath kept thee back from honour.

12. And Balaam said unto Balak,—Was it not so that even unto thy messengers whom thou didst send unto me, I spake saying-

13. Though Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, yet could I not go beyond the bidding of Yahweh, to, do good or ill, out of my own heart,—what Yahweh shall speak, that, must I speak?

14. Now, therefore, behold me! going to my own people,—Come now! let me advise thee, what this people shall do unto thy people in the after-part of the days. 

15.  So he took up his parable and said,—The oracle of Balaam, son of Beor, Yea the oracle of the man, of opened eye;

16. The oracle of one hearing sayings of GOD, And knowing the knowledge of the Most High,—Who the sight of the Almighty, receiveth in vision, Who falleth down but hath unveiled eyes:—

17. I see One, who is not now, I observe One, who is not nigh,—There hath marched forth a Star out of Jacob. And arisen a Sceptre out of Israel, That hath dishonoured the beard of Moab, Yea the crown of the head of all the tumultuous;

18. So Edom hath become a possession, Yea a possession is Seir to his foes,—But, Israel, is doing valiantly;

19. Yea One wieldeth dominion out of Jacob,—Who hath destroyed the remnant out of the fortress.

20. And, when he saw Amalek, he took up, his parable, and said—The beginning of nations,—Amalek, But his latter end is even to perish.

21. And when he saw the Kenite, he took up his parable, and said,—Enduring thy dwelling-place, Set thou then in the crag, thy nest;

22. Yet shall it be for destruction, O Kain,—How long shall Assyria hold thee captive?

23. And he took up his parable, and said,—Alas who shall survive its fulfillment by GOD;

24. When, ships, [come] from the coast of the isles, And humble Assyria, and humble the Hebrew,—And he too, is even to perish?

25. Then Balaam arose, and went and returned unto his place,—and, Balak also, went his way.  

## Numbers 25

1. And Israel remained among the acacias,—and the people began to go away unchastely unto the daughters of Moab;

2. who invited the people unto the sacrifices of their gods,—so the people did eat, and did bow themselves down unto their gods.

3. Thus Israel let himself be bound unto Baal-peor, and the anger of Yahweh kindled upon Israel.

4. And Yahweh said unto Moses—Take all the heads of the people, and crucify them unto Yahweh. in the face of the sun,—that the heat of the anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.

5. And Moses said unto the judges of Israel,—Slay ye each one his men, who have let themselves he bound unto Baal-peor. 

6.  And lo! a man of the sons of Israel coming in, who brought near unto his brethren a Midianite woman, before the eyes of Moses, and before the eyes of all the assembly of the sons of Israel, when they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

7. And Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest saw it, so he rose up out of the midst of the assembly, and took a spear in his hand;

8. and went in after the man of Israel into the pleasure-tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, in her parts of shame,—so the plague was restrained from against the sons of Israel.

9. Then was it found that they who had died by the plague were four and twenty thousand.

10. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses saying:

11. Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, hath turned back my wrath from against the sons of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy, in their midst, so that I made not an end of the sons of Israel. in my jealousy.

12. Wherefore say,—Behold me! giving unto him my covenant of peace;

13. so shall it prove to be unto him and unto his seed after him, the covenant of our age-abiding priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and did put a propitiatory-covering over the sons of Israel.

14. Now, the name of the man of Israel that was smitten, who was smitten with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri son of Salu,—prince of an ancestral house of the Simeonites;

15. and, the name of the woman who was smitten, the Midianitess, was Cozbi, daughter of Zur,—the head of his kindred, of an ancestral house in Midian, was he. 

16.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses saying:

17. Besiege the Midianites,—and ye shall smite them:

18. for, besiegers, were they unto you, with their wiles wherewith they beguiled you, over the matter of Peor,—and over he matter of Cozbi, daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was smitten in the day of the plague, over the matter of Peor.  

## Numbers 26

1. And it came to pass, after the plague, that Yahweh spake unto Moses, and unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saying:

2. Reckon ye up the sum of all the assembly of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upwards, by their ancestral houses,—every one able to go forth to war in Israel.

3. So then Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them, in the waste plains of Moab,—by the Jordan near Jericho saying:

4. From twenty years old and upwards, As Yahweh commanded Moses, and the sons of Israel, who had come forth out of the land of Egypt. 

5.  Reuben, the firstborn of Israel,—the sons of Reuben, To Hanoch, pertained the family of the Hanochites; To Pallu, the family of the Palluites;

7. These, are the families of the Reubenites,—and they who were numbered of them were found to be—forty-three thousand, and seven hundred, and thirty.

8. Now, the sons of Pallu, were Eliab;

9. and the sons of Eliab, Nemuel, and Dathan and Abiram,—The same, Dathan and Abiram, notable men of the assembly, who contended against Moses and against Aaron in the assembly of Korah, when they contended against Yahweh;

10. and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up—with Korah also, when the assembly died,—when the fire consumed two hundred and fifty men, and they became a warning;

11. But, the sons of Korah, died not.

12. The sons of Simeon, by their families, To Nemuel, pertained the family of the Nemuelites, To Jamin, the family of the Jaminites,—To Jachin, the family of the Jachinites:

19. The sons of Judah, Er and Onan,—but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.

20. And so, as to the sons of Judah, by their families, it was found that—To Shelah, pertained the family of the Shelanites, To Perez, the family of the Perezites,—To Zerah, the family of the Zerahites;

21. And, as to the sons of Perez, it was found that—To Hezron, pertained the family of the Hezronites,—To Hamul, the family of the Hamulites:

31. And Asriel, the family of the Asrielites; And, Shechem, the family of the Shechemites;

32. And Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites; And, Hepher, the family of the Hepherites.

33. Now Zelophehad, son of Hepher, had no sons, but only, daughters,—and, the names of the daughters of Zelophehad, were Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah Milcah, and Tirzah.

34. These, are the families of Manasseh,—and, they who were numbered of them,—fifty-two thousand, and seven hundred.

35. These are the sons of Ephraim by their families, To Shuthelah, pertained the family of the Shuthelahites, To Becher, the family of the Becherites,—To Tahan, the family of the Tahanites.

53. Unto these, shall be apportioned the land as an inheritance by the number of names.

54. For the large one, thou shalt make large his inheritance, and for the small one, thou shalt make small his inheritance,—unto each one, in proportion to them who were numbered of him, shall be given his inheritance.

55. Nevertheless by lot, shall the land be apportioned,—by the names of the tribes of their fathers, shall they inherit.

56. At the bidding of the lot, shall be apportioned his inheritance,—between large and small. 

57.  And these, are they who were numbered of the Levites by their families, To Gershon, pertained the family of the Gershonites, To Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; To Merari, the family of the Merarites.

59. and the name of the wife of Amram, was Jochebed daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt,—and she bare to Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister:

60. And, there were born to Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,—Eleazar and Ithamar;

61. But Nadab and Abihu died,—when they brought near strange fire before Yahweh:

62. And they who were numbered of them were found to be—twenty-three thousand, all the males from one month old and upwards—for they had not numbered themselves in the midst of the sons of Israel, because there was given unto them no inheritance, in the midst of the sons of Israel. 

63.  These, are they who were numbered by Moses, and Eleazar, the priest,—when they numbered the sons of Israel, in the waste plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho.

64. And among these, was there not found a man of them who had been numbered by Moses, and Aaron the priest,—when they numbered the sons of Israel in the desert of Sinai.

65. For Yahweh had said of them, They shall surely die, in the desert. And there was not left of them a man, save only, Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun.  

## Numbers 27

1. Then came near the daughters of Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh pertaining to the families of Manasseh, son of Joseph,—these being the names of his daughters, Mahlah Noah and Hoglah and Milcah, and Tirzah.

2. So they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes, and all the assembly,—at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying:

3. Our father, died in the desert, although, he, was not among the assembly that conspired against Yahweh, in the assembly of Korah,—but, in his own sin, died he; and sons, had he none.

4. Wherefore should the name of our father be withdrawn out of the midst of his family, because he had no son? Give ye unto us a possession, in the midst of the brethren of our father.

5. And Moses brought near their cause before Yahweh.

6. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

7. A right thing, are the daughters of Zelophehad speaking: Thou shalt, surely give, them a possession for an inheritance, in the midst of the brethren of their father,—and shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass over unto them.

8. And unto the sons of Israel, shalt thou speak, saying,—When, any man, shall die, having no son, then shall ye cause his inheritance to pass over to his daughter.

9. And, if he hath no daughter, then shall ye give his inheritance unto his, brethren.

10. And if he hath no brethren, then shall ye give his inheritance unto the brethren of his father.

11. And, if his father hath no brethren, then shall ye give his inheritance unto his blood-relation that is near unto him of his family, and he shall possess it,—So shall it serve the sons of Israel as a regulative statute, As Yahweh commanded Moses. 

12.  And Yahweh said unto Moses, Go up into this mount of Abarim,—and see, the land which I have given unto the sons of Israel;

13. And, when thou hast seen it, then shalt thou also be withdrawn unto thy kinsfolk,—as Aaron thy brother was withdrawn;

14. because ye resisted my bidding—in the desert of Zin when the assembly contended,—that ye should hallow me regarding the waters, before their eyes,—the same, were the waters of Meribah, of Kadesh in the desert of Zin. 

15.  Then spake Moses unto Yahweh saying:

16. Let Yahweh, God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the assembly;

17. who may go out before them and who may come in before them, and who may take them out and who may bring them in,—that the assembly of Yahweh become not as sheep that have no shepherd.

18. And Yahweh said unto Moses: Take thee Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit,—then shalt thou lean thy hand upon him;

19. and shalt cause him to stand before Eleazar the priest, and before all the assembly,—and shalt charge him before their eyes;

20. and shalt put some of thine honour upon him,—that all the assembly of the sons of Israel may hearken.

21. And, before Eleazar the priest, shall he stand, and shall ask by him for the decision of the Lights, before Yahweh,—at the bidding thereof, shall they go out, and at the bidding thereof, shall they come in—he, and all the sons of Israel with him, even all the assembly.

22. And Moses did as Yahweh commanded him,—and took Joshua, and caused him to stand before Eleazar the priest, and before all the assembly;

23. and leaned his hands upon him and charged him,—As Yahweh spake by the hand of Moses.  

## Numbers 28

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Command the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—My offering, my food for my altar-flames my satisfying odour, shall ye take heed to offer unto me in its season,

3. Therefore shalt thou say to them. This, is the altar-flame, which ye shall offer unto Yahweh,—he-lambs a year old, without defect, two daily, as a continual ascending-sacrifice.

4. The one lamb, shalt thou offer in the morning,—and the other lamb, shalt thou offer between the two evenings;

5. also the tenth of an ephah of fine meal for a meal-offering,—overflowed with beaten oil the fourth of a hin:

6. a continual ascending-sacrifice,—which was offered in Mount Sinai, as a satisfying odour an altar-flame unto Yahweh.

7. Also the drink-offering thereof the fourth of a hin for each lamb,—in a holy place, shall it be poured out as a libation of strong drink unto Yahweh.

8. And, the other lamb, shalt thou offer between the two evenings; like the meal-offering of the morning, and like the drink-offering thereof, shalt thou offer, an altar flame a satisfying odour unto Yahweh. 

9.  But, on the sabbath day, two he-lambs a year old without defect, and two-tenths of fine meal as a meal-offering, overflowed with oil and the drink-offering thereof:

10. the ascending-sacrifice of a sabbath, on its own sabbath,—besides the continual ascending-sacrifice and the drink-offering thereof.

11. And in the beginnings of your months, shall ye bring near an ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh, two choice bullocks and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without defect;

12. and three-tenths of fine meal, as a meal-offering, overflowed with oil, to each bullock,—and two-tenths of fine-meal as a meal-offering, overflowed with oil, to each ram;

13. and a tenth, severally, of fine meal as a meal-offering, overflowed with oil, to each lamb,—an ascending-sacrifice, a satisfying odour, an altar-flame unto Yahweh.

14. And as their drink-offerings, half a hin, shall be to a bullock and the third of a hin to a ram, and the fourth of a hin to a lamb, of wine,—This, is the ascending-sacrifice of a month in its month, for the months of the year.

15. Also one he-goat as a sin-bearer unto Yahweh,—besides the continual ascending-sacrifice, shall it be offered, with the drink-offering thereof. 

16.  And, on the first month on the fourteenth day of the month, shall be a passover unto Yahweh;

17. and, on the fifteenth day of this month, a festival,—seven days, unleavened cakes, shall be eaten.

18. On the first day, a holy convocation,—no laborious work, shall ye do;

19. but ye shall bring near—as an altar-flame—an ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh,—two choice bullocks and one ram,—and seven he-lambs a year old, without defect, must they be for you;

20. and, for their meal-offering, fine meal, overflowed with oil,—three-tenths for a bullock, and two-tenths for a ram, shall ye offer;

21. a tenth, severally, shalt thou offer for each lamb,—for the seven lambs,;

22. also one he-goat for bearing sin, to put a propitiatory-covering over you:

23. in addition to the ascending-sacrifice of the morning, which is for the continual ascending-sacrifice, shall ye offer these.

24. Like these, shall ye offer, daily, for seven days, as the food of the altar-flame of a satisfying odour, unto Yahweh,—besides the continual ascending-sacrifice, shall it be offered, with the drink-offering thereof.

25. And on the seventh day, shall ye have, a holy convocation,—no laborious work, shall ye do.

26. And on the day of firstfruits when ye bring near a new meal-offering unto Yahweh, in your weeks, a holy convocation shall there be unto you, no laborious work, shall ye do;

27. but ye shall bring near as an ascending-sacrifice, for a satisfying odour unto Yahweh, two choice bullocks one ram,—seven he-lambs a year old;

28. also their meal-offering, fine meal, overflowed with oil,—three-tenths for each bullock, two-tenths for the one ram;

29. a tenth severally, for each lamb,—of the seven lambs;

30. one young he-goat,—for putting a propitiatory-covering over you:

31. in addition to, the continual ascending-sacrifice, with the meal-offering thereof, shall ye offer them,—without defect, shall they be for you, with their drink-offerings.  

## Numbers 29

1. And in the seventh month, on the first of the month, a holy convocation, shall there be unto you, no laborious work, shall ye do,—a day of loud acclamation, shall it be unto you.

2. Therefore shall ye offer, as an ascending-sacrifice for a satisfying odour unto Yahweh, one choice bullock one ram,—seven he-lambs a year old without defect;

3. and as their meal-offering, fine meal, overflowed with oil,—three-tenths to a bullock two-tenths to a ram;

4. and one-tenth to each lamb,—of the seven lambs;

6. in addition to the monthly ascending-sacrifice with the meal-offering thereof and the continual ascending sacrifice, with the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offering thereof according to their regulation,—for a satisfying odour, an altar-flame, unto Yahweh.

7. And on the tenth of this seventh month, a holy convocation, shall there be unto you,—when ye shall humble your souls,—no work, shall ye do;

8. but ye shall bring near, as an ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh a satisfying odour, one choice bullock one ram,—seven he-lambs a year old, without defect, shall they be for you;

9. and, as their meal-offering, fine meal overflowed with oil,—three-tenths to a bullock, two-tenths to the one ram;

19. also one young he-goat as a sin-bearer,—in addition to the continual ascending-sacrifice, with its meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.

20. And on the third day, eleven bullocks two rams,—and fourteen he-lambs a year old without defect;

21. with their meal-offering and their drink-offerings, to the bullocks, to the rams, and to the lambs, by their number, according to the regulation;

22. also one young he-goat as a sin-bearer, in addition to the continual ascending-sacrifice, with the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offering thereof.

23. And on the fourth day, ten bullocks, two rams,—fourteen he-lambs a year old without defect;

24. their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, to the bullocks, to the rams, and to the lambs, by their number, according to the regulation;

25. also one he-goat as a sin-bearer,—in addition to the continual ascending-sacrifice, the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offering thereof.

26. And on the fifth day, nine bullocks two rams,—fourteen he-lambs, a year old without defect;

27. with their meal-offering and their drink-offerings,—to the bullocks to the rams, and to the lambs, by their number, according to the regulation:

28. also one young he-goat as a sin-bearer,—in addition to the continual ascending-sacrifice, with the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offering thereof.

29. And on the sixth day, eight bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without defect;

30. with their meal-offering and their drink-offerings to the bullocks, to the rams, and to the lambs, by their number, according to the regulation;

31. also one young he-goat as a sin-bearer,—in addition to the continual ascending-sacrifice, the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offerings thereof,

32. And on the seventh day, seven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old, with-out defect:

33. with their meal-offering and their drink-offering, to the bullock, to the rams, and to the lambs by their number, according to their regulation;

34. also one young he-goat as a sin-bearer, in addition to the continual ascending-sacrifice, the meal-offering thereof and the drink-offering thereof

35. [And] on the eighth day, a closing feast shall there be unto you, no laborious work, shall ye do;

36. but ye shall bring near—as an ascending-sacrifice, an altar-flame of a satisfying odour, unto Yahweh—one bullock, one ram,—seven he-lambs a year old, without defect:

37. [with] their meal-offering and their drink-offerings—to the bullock to the ram, and to the lambs—by their number, according to the regulation;

38. also one young he-goat as a sin-bearer,—in addition to the continual ascending-sacrifice, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.

39. These, shall ye offer unto Yahweh in your appointed seasons,—besides your vow-offerings and your freewill offerings—as your ascending-sacrifices, and as your meal-offerings, and as your drink-offerings and as your peace-offerings.

40. So Moses told the sons of Israel,—According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses.  

## Numbers 30

1. And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel saying: This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded-

2. When, a man, shall vow a vow unto Yahweh, or swear an oath to bind a bond upon his soul, he shall not break his word,—according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth, shall he do. 

3.  And, when, a woman, shall vow a vow unto Yahweh, and bind a bond, in the house of her father, in her youth;

4. and her father shall hear her vow or her bond which she bindeth upon her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her, then shall all her vows stand, and every bond which she hath bound upon her soul shall stand.

5. But, if her father forbade her, in the day when he heard, none of her vows or her bonds which she hath bound upon her soul, shall stand,—and, Yahweh, will pardon her, because her father forbade her.

6. But, if she, belonged to a husband, when her vows were taken upon her,—or a rash utterance fell from her lips, wherewith she put a bond upon her soul;

7. and her husband heard it, and on the day that he heard, he held his peace at her, then shall her vows stand and her bonds which she hath bound upon her soul, shall stand,

8. But if, on the day her husband heard, he forbade her, then shall he have made of none effect her vow that is upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she put a bond upon her soul,—and, Yahweh, will pardon her.

9. But as for the vow of a widow, or of a woman divorced, whatsoever she hath bound on her soul, shall stand against her.

10. But, if in the house of her husband, she vowed, or bound a bond upon her soul. with an oath;

11. and her husband heard, and held his peace at her, did not forbid her, then shall all her vows stand, and every bond which she hath bound upon her soul, shall stand.

12. But if her husband, did make, them, of none effect, on the day he heard, nothing which came forth out of her lips—of her vows, or of the bond of her soul, shall stand,—her husband, made it of none effect, and Yahweh, will pardon her:

13. As for any vow, or any oath of binding, to humble one’s soul, her husband, may make it stand, or, her husband, may make it of none effect.

14. But if her husband do hold his peace, at her, from day to day, then shall he cause all her vows to stand, or all her bonds which are upon her,—cause them to stand, because he held his peace at her, on the day when he heard.

15. And, if he, do make them of none effect, after that he hath heard them, then shall he bear her iniquity.

16. These are the statutes which Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, in her youth in the house of her father.  

## Numbers 31

1. Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

2. Exact thou the avenging of the sons of Israel, from the Midianites,—and, afterwards, shalt thou be withdrawn unto thy kinsfolk.

3. So Moses spake unto the people saying, Arm ye from among you men, for the war, and let them go against Midian, to render the avenging of Yahweh upon Midian.

4. A thousand from each tribe,—of all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send forth unto the war.

5. And there volunteered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of each tribe,—twelve thousand, armed for war.

6. And Moses sent them a thousand of each tribe to the war,—them, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary, and the alarm trumpets, in his hand. 

7.  So they made war upon Midian, as Yahweh had commanded Moses, and slew every male:

8. and the kings of Midian, slew they besides their other slain namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian,—Balaam also, son of Beor, slew they with the sword.

9. And the sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones,—all their cattle also and all their flocks and all their substance, carried they off as a prey;

10. all their cities also in their sites, and all their encampments, burned they up with fire.

11. Then took they all the spoil, and all the booty,—both of man and beast;

12. and brought in unto Moses and unto Eleazar the priest and unto the assembly of the sons of Israel—the captives and the booty, and the spoil unto the camp,—unto the waste plains of Moab, which are by Jordan, near Jericho. 

13.  And Moses, and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the assembly, went forth to meet them,—unto the outside of the camp.

14. Then was Moses sore displeased with the officers of the force,—the princes of thousands, and the princes of hundreds who were coming in from the warring host.

15. And Moses said unto them,—Have ye saved alive every female?

16. Lo! they, became unto the sons of Israel, by the advice of Balaam, the cause of daring acts of treachery against Yahweh, over the affair of Peor,—and then came the plague against the assembly of Yahweh!

17. Now, therefore, slay ye every male among the young,—every woman also that hath cohabited with man, slay ye.

18. But all the young of womankind that have, not cohabited with man, preserve alive for yourselves.

19. Ye, then, pitch outside the camp, for seven days,—whosoever hath killed a person and whoever hath touched the slain, cleanse yourselves (from sin) on the third day and on the seventh day ye and your captives,.

20. Every garment also, and every article of skin and every thing made of goat’s-hair, and every article of wood, shall ye cleanse (from sin).

21. Then said Eleazar the priest unto the men of the host, who had been to the war: This, is the statute of the law, which Yahweh hath commanded Moses:

22. Surely the gold and the silver,—the bronze the iron, the tin and the lead,

23. whatsoever thing can go into fire, ye shall pass through fire and it shall be clean, only with the water of separation, shall ye cleanse it (from sin). But whatsoever cannot go into fire, ye shall pass through water.

24. And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and be clean,—and after-wards, shall ye come into the camp. 

25.  Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

26. Reckon thou up the sum of the booty that was captured, both of man and of beast,—thou and Eleazar the priest, and the ancestral heads of the assembly;

27. and divide the booty into two parts, between them who took upon them the war, who went out in the host,—and all the [rest of the] assembly.

28. Then shalt thou levy a tribute unto Yahweh—from the men of war, who went forth in the host, one living thing, out of five hundred,—of the human beings, and of the herd, and of the asses and of the flock:

29. out of their half, shall ye take [them],—and thou shall give [them] unto Eleazar the priest as a heave-offering unto Yahweh.

30. And out of the half allotted to the sons of Israel, shalt thou take one allotted portion out of fifty of the human beings, of the herd, of the asses and of the flock of all the cattle,—and shalt give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the habitation of Yahweh.

31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did,—As Yahweh commanded Moses.

32. And it came to pass that the booty, over and above the prey which the people of the host had seized, was,—of the flock, six hundred and seventy-five thousand;

33. and, of the herd, seventy-two thousand;

34. and, of the asses, sixty-one thousand;

35. and, of the human persons, even of the woman-kind who had not cohabited with man,—all the persons, thirty-two thousand.

36. And the half, the share of them who had gone forth in the host, was,—the number of the flock—three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred;

37. and so, the tribute unto Yahweh, out of the flock, was—six hundred and seventy-five;

38. and the herd, thirty-six thousand,—and the tribute of them unto Yahweh—seventy-two;

39. and the asses, thirty thousand and five hundred,—and the tribute of them unto Yahweh, sixty-one;

40. and the human persons, sixteen thousand,—and the tribute of them unto Yahweh, thirty-two persons.

41. And Moses gave the tribute—the heave-offering of Yahweh, unto Eleazar the priest,—As Yahweh commanded Moses.

42. And, of the half, allotted unto the sons of Israel,—which Moses halved away from the men who had gone out in the host,

43. the half allotted unto the assembly, was—of the flock, three hundred and thirty-seven thousand, and five hundred;

44. and, of the herd, six and thirty thousand;

45. and, of asses, thirty thousand and five hundred;

46. and, human persons, sixteen thousand.

47. So then Moses took—out of the half belonging to the sons of Israel the allotted portion one out of fifty, of the human beings and of the beasts,—and gave them unto the Levites, the keepers of the charge of the habitation of Yahweh, As Yahweh commanded Moses. 

48.  Then came near unto Moses the officers who belonged unto the thousands of the host,—the princes of thousands and the princes of hundreds;

49. and said unto Moses, Thy servants have reckoned up the sum of the men of war who are in our hand,—and there is not missed from among us, a man!

50. Therefore have we brought near an offering unto Yahweh, what, each man, hath found—articles of gold, ankle chains and bracelets, rings earrings and buckles,—to put a propitiatory-covering over our souls before Yahweh.

51. So Moses, and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,—all the wrought articles.

52. And all the gold of the heave-offering which they offered up unto Yahweh, was—sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels,—of the princes of thousands, and of the princes of hundreds.

53. The men of the host, had taken prey, each man for himself.

54. So then Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the princes of thousands, and hundreds,—and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the sons of Israel before Yahweh.  

## Numbers 32

1. Now, much cattle, had come into the possession of the sons of Reuben and of the sons of Gad, an exceeding mighty number. And when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, lo! the place, was a place for cattle.

2. So the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came in,—and spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of assembly, saying,

3. As touching Ataroth and Dibon, and Jazer and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh,—and Sebam and Nebo, and Beon-

4. the land which Yahweh smote before the assembly of Israel, a land for cattle, it is,—and, thy servants, have cattle.

5. And they said—If we have found favour in thine eyes, let this land be given unto thy servants, for a possession,—do not take us over the Jordan.

6. Then said Moses unto the sons of Gad and unto the sons of Reuben,—Shall, your brethren, go into the war, and ye, settle down here?

7. Wherefore, then, should ye dissuade the heart of the sons of Israel, from passing over into the land which Yahweh hath given to them?

8. Thus, did your fathers,—when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea, to view the land,

9. and they went up as far as the ravine of Eschol, and viewed the land, and then dissuaded the heart of the sons of Israel from entering into the land, which Yahweh had given them.

10. Then was the anger of Yahweh kindled on that day,—and he sware, saying:

11. Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upwards, shall see the soil, which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac and unto Jacob, because they have not followed after me fully;

12. save Caleb son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, and Joshua, son of Nun,—for they followed after Yahweh, fully.

13. So the anger of Yahweh kindled upon Israel, and he made them wander in the desert, forty years,—until all the generation who had done the evil in the eyes of Yahweh, had wasted away!

14. Lo! therefore, ye have arisen in the room of your fathers, a brood of sinful men,—to heap up yet more upon the heat of the anger of Yahweh, towards Israel.

15. If ye do turn away from following him, then will he yet again leave them behind in the desert,—so shall ye bring destruction upon all this people. 

16.  Then came they near unto him, and said, Folds, for flocks, would we build for our cattle, here,—and cities for our little ones;

17. but, we, would arm ourselves promptly, before the sons of Israel, until that we have brought them into their place,—so should our little ones remain in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.

18. We would not return unto our houses,—until the sons of Israel have possessed themselves each man, of his inheritance.

19. For we would not inherit with them, over the Jordan, and onwards,—because our inheritance hath come unto us on this side the Jordan towards sunrise.

20. And Moses said unto them, If ye will indeed do this thing,—if ye will arm yourselves, before Yahweh, for the war;

21. and every armed man of you pass over the Jordan before Yahweh,—until he hath dispossessed his enemies, from before him;

22. and the land be subdued before Yahweh then afterwards, shall ye return, and shall be acquitted by Yahweh and by Israel,—and this land shall be yours for a possession before Yahweh.

23. But, if ye shall not do this, lo! ye will have sinned against Yahweh,—and take note of your sin, that it will find you out.

24. Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your flocks,—and then that which hath gone forth from your mouth, ye shall do.

25. Then spake the sons of Gad, and the sons of Reuben unto Moses, saying,—thy servants, will do, as, my lord, is giving command.

26. Our little ones, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts, shall remain there in the cities of Gilead;

27. and thy servants, will pass over every one armed for war, before Yahweh to battle,—as, my lord is speaking. 

28.  So Moses gave command concerning them, unto Eleazar the priest and unto Joshua son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes, of the sons of Israel;

29. and Moses said unto them—If the sons of Gad and the son of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every one armed for the war before Yahweh, and the land be subdued before you, then shall ye give unto them the land of Gilead, for a possession.

30. But, if they will not pass over armed, with you, then shall they accept a possession in your midst, in the land of Canaan.

31. Then responded the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, saying,—That which Yahweh had spoken unto thy servants, so, will we do.

32. We, will pass over armed, before Yahweh into the land of Canaan,—then shall be ours, the possession of our inheritance across the Jordan.

33. So then Moses gave unto them even unto the sons of Gad and unto the sons of Reuben and unto the half tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land by her cities with boundaries, even the cities of the land round about.

34. And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth,—and Aroer;

35. and Atroth-shophan and Jazer, and Jogbehah;

36. and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran,—fortified cities and folds for flocks.

37. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh,—and Kiriathaim,

38. and Nebo and Baal-meon—their names being changed, and Sibmah,—and they gave names to the cities which they built.

39. Then went the sons of Machir son of Manasseh to Gilead, and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein,

40. So Moses gave Gilead unto Machir son of Manasseh, and he dwelt therein.

41. And Jair, son of Manasseh, went, and captured their encampments,—and called them Havvoth-jair [="The encampments of Jair"].

42. And, Nobah, went, and captured Kenath, with the villages thereof,—and called it Nobah, after his own name.  

## Numbers 33

1. These, are the departures of the sons of Israel whereby they came forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts,—in the hand of Moses and Aaron.

2. And Moses wrote their comings forth by their departures, at the bidding of Yahweh,—and these, are their departures by their comings forth.

3. So then they brake up from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, on the morrow of the passover, came forth the sons of Israel with an uplifted hand, in the sight of all the Egyptians;

4. when the Egyptians, were burying them whom Yahweh had smitten among them, every firstborn,—when, upon their gods, Yahweh had executed judgments,

5. Thus then the sons of Israel brake up from Rameses,—and encamped in Succoth.

6. And they brake up from Succoth,—and encamped in Etham, which is at the edge of the desert.

7. And they brake up from Etham, and turned upon Pi-hahiroth, which is over against Baal-zephon,—and encamped before Migdol.

8. And they brake up from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea towards the desert,—and went their way a journey of three days in the desert of Etham, and encamped in Marah.

9. And they brake up from Marah, and came in towards Elim; there being, in Elim, twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm-trees, so they encamped there.

10. And they brake up from Elim,—and encamped by the Red Sea.

11. And they brake up from the Red Sea,—and encamped in the desert of Sin.

12. And they brake up from the desert of Sin,—and encamped in Dophkah.

13. And they brake up from Dophkah,—and encamped in Alush.

14. And they brake up from Alush,—and encamped in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.

15. And they brake up from Rephidim,—and encamped in the desert of Sinai.

16. And they brake up from the desert of Sinai,—and encamped in Kibroth-hattaavah.

17. And they brake up from Kibroth-hattaavah,—and encamped in Hazeroth.

18. And they brake up from Hazeroth,—and encamped in Rithmah.

19. And they brake up from Rithmah,—and encamped in Rimmon-perez.

20. And they brake up from Rimmon-perez,—and encamped in Libnah.

21. And they brake up from Libnah,—and encamped in Rissah.

22. And they brake up from Rissah,—and encamped in Kehelathah.

23. And they brake up from Kehelathah,—and encamped in Mount Shepher.

24. And they brake up from Mount Shepher,—and encamped in Haradah.

25. And they brake up from Haradah,—and encamped in Makheloth.

26. And they brake up from Makheloth,—and encamped in Tahath.

27. And they brake up from Tahath,—and encamped in Terah.

28. And they brake up from Terah,—and encamped in Mithkah.

29. And they brake up from Mithkah,—and encamped in Hashmonah.

30. And they brake up from Hashmonah,—and encamped in Moseroth.

31. And they brake up from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene-jaakan.

32. And they brake up from Bene-jaakan, and encamped in Hor-haggidgad.

33. And they brake up from Hor-haggidgad,—and encamped in Jotbathah,—

34. And they brake up from Jotbathah,—and encamped in Abronah.

35. And they brake up from Abronah,—and encamped in Eziongeber.

36. And they brake up from Eziongeber,—and encamped in the desert of Zin, the same, is Kadesh.

37. And they brake, up from Kadesh,—and encamped in Mount Hor, on the outskirts of the land of Edom;

38. and Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor, at the bidding of Yahweh, and died there, in the fortieth year, by the coming forth of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first of the month.

39. Now, Aaron, was a hundred and twenty-three years old, when he died in Mount Hor.

40. And a Canaanite king of Arad, who was dwelling in the South, in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming in of the sons of Israel.

41. And, they brake up from Mount Hor,—and encamped in Zalmonah.

42. And they brake up from Zalmonah,—and encamped in Punon.

43. And they brake up from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.

44. And they brake up from Oboth,—and encamped in Iye-abarim, within the bounds of Moab.

45. And they brake up from Iyim,—and encamped in Dibon-gad.

46. And they brake up from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim.

47. And they brake up from Almon-diblathaim,—and encamped among the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

48. And they brake up from the mountains of Abarim,—and encamped in the waste plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho.

49. Thus did they encamp by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth unto Abel-Shittim [that is, "The acacia—meadows"]—in the waste plains of Moab. 

50.  And Yahweh spake unto Moses, in the waste plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho saying:

51. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—When ye do pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

52. then shall ye dispossess all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and shall destroy all their figured stones,—all their molten images, also shall ye destroy, and all their high places, shall ye lay waste.

53. So shall ye possess the land, and settle down therein,—for unto you, have I given the land to possess it.

54. And ye shall take your inheritance in the land by lot by your families—for the large one, ye shall make large his inheritance, and for the small one, make small his inheritance, whithersoever the lot cometh out to him, his, shall, it be, by the tribes of your fathers, shall ye take your inheritance.

55. But if ye do not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall it be. that they whom ye leave remaining of them will become pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and will harass you, concerning the land, wherein, ye are settling down.

56. And it shall be, that as I thought to do unto them, I will do unto you.  

## Numbers 34

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:

2. Command the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, When, ye, are coming into the land of Canaan, this is the land which shall fall unto you, as an inheritance, even the land of Canaan, by the boundaries thereof.

3. Ye shall therefore have a south corner, from the desert of Zin, on the side of Edom,—so shall ye have a south boundary, from the end of the salt sea, eastward:

4. and the boundary shall go round for you from the south towards the cliffs of Akrabbim, then cross over towards Zin, and the extension thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, then shall it reach out to Hazar-addar, and cross over towards Azmon;

5. then shall the boundary turn round from Azmon towards the ravine of Egypt,—and the extension thereof shall be towards the sea.

6. And, for a west boundary,—ye shall have the great sea, even a boundary, this, shall serve you as west boundary.

7. And, this, shall serve you as a north boundary,—From the great sea, ye shall draw a line for you to Mount Hor:

8. From Mount Hor, ye shall draw a line to the entering in of Hamath,—and the extension of the boundary shall be towards Zedad:

9. then shall the boundary reach out towards Ziphron, and the extension thereof, be to Hazar-enan. This, shall serve you as a north, boundary.

10. Then shall ye draw for yourselves a line, for an east boundary,—from Hazar-enan towards Shepham;

11. and the boundary shall go down from Shepham towards Riblah, on the east of Ain—then shall the boundary go down and strike on the side of the Sea of Chinnereth, eastward:

12. then shall the boundary go down towards the Jordan, and the extension thereof be to the salt sea. This shall be your land by the boundaries thereof round about.

13. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel saying,—This, is the land, which ye shall inherit by lot, which Yahweh had commanded to be given to the nine tribes and the half tribe.

14. For the tribe of the sons of the Reubenites by their ancestral house, and the tribe of the sons of Gad, by their ancestral house, have received, and, the half tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:

15. the two tribes, and the half tribe, have received their inheritance—on this side Jordan near Jericho, eastwards, towards sunrise. 

16.  Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

17. These, are the names of the men who shall receive for you the land, as an inheritance, Eleazar, the priest, and Joshua, son of Nun.

18. Also, one prince from each tribe, shall ye take to receive the land, as an inheritance.

19. These, therefore, are the names of the men,—For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;

20. And, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel son of Ammihud:

21. For the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon;

22. And, for the tribe of the sons of Dan, a prince—Bukki, son of Jogli:

23. For the sons of Joseph, For the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, a prince,—Hanniel son of Ephod;

24. And, for the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, a prince,—Kemuel, son of Shiphtan;

25. And, for the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, a prince,—Elizaphan, son of Parnach;

26. And, for the tribe of the sons of Issachar, a prince,—Paltiel son of Azzan;

27. And, for the tribe of the sons of Asher, a prince,—Ahihud son of Shelomi:

28. And, for the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, a prince,—Pedahel, son of Ammihud.

29. These, are they whom Yahweh hath commanded to receive for the sons of Israel their inheritance, in the land of Canaan.  

## Numbers 35

1. And Yahweh spake unto Moses in the waste plains of Moab,—by Jordan, near Jericho, saying:

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they give unto the Levites—out of the inheritance which they possess—cities to dwell in,—pasture land also unto the cities, round about them, shall ye give unto the Levites.

3. So shall the cities be theirs, to dwell in,—and their pasture lands, shall, be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beasts.

4. And, the pasture lands of the cities which ye shall give unto the Levite, shall be,—from the wall of the city, and outwards, a thousand cubits round about

5. So ye shall measure—on the outside of the city—the eastward quarter two thousand by the cubit, and the south quarter two thousand by the cubit, and the west quarter two thousand by the cubit and the north quarter two thousand by the cubit, with, the city, in the midst. This, shall be unto them the pasture lands of the cities,

6. And, among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give that the manslayer may flee thither,—and besides them, ye shall give, forty-two cities,

7. All the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be forty-eight cities,—them, and their pasture lands,

8. And as touching the cities which ye shall give out of the possession of the sons of Israel from the many, shall ye take many, and from the few, shall ye take few,—each, according to his inheritance, which they shall inherit, shall give of his cities unto the Levites. 

9.  Then spake Yahweh unto Moses, saying:

10. Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them,—When ye are passing over the Jordan unto the land of Canaan,

11. then shall ye find for you, convenient cities, cities of refuge, shall they be unto you,—and the manslayer, who hath slain a person, by mistake, shall flee thither.

12. So shall the cities serve you for places of refuge from the redeemer,—that the manslayer may not die, until he has stood before the assembly, for judgment,

13. And as touching the cities which ye shall give six cities of refuge, shall there be unto you.

14. Three of the cities, shall ye give, on this side the Jordan, and three of the cities, shall ye give in the land of Canaan,—cities of refuge, shall they be.

15. For the sons of Israel and for the sojourner. and for the settler in your midst, shall these six cities serve, as places of refuge,—that any one may flee thither who hath slain a person, by mistake.

16. If, then, with an instrument of iron, he smote him, and he died, a manslayer, he is,—a manslayer, shall surely die.

17. Or if with a stone thrown by hand, where-by one might die, he smote him and he died, a manslayer, he is,—the man-slayer, shall surely die,

18. Or, if with hand-weapon of wood, wherewith one might die, he smote him and he died a manslayer, he is,—the manslayer shall surely die.

19. The blood-redeemer, he, shall put to death the man-slayer,—when he lighteth upon him, he, shall put him to death.

20. Or if with hate, he shall thrust at him, or hurl at him designedly, and he have died,

21. or if with enmity, he hath smitten him with his hand and he is dead, then shall he that dealt the blow, be surely put to death. a manslayer, he is—the blood-redeemer shall put to death the man-slayer, when he lighteth upon him.

22. But if suddenly, without enmity, he shall thrust him, or hurl upon him any missile, without design;

23. Or with any stone whereby one might die without seeing him, and it fall upon him, and he dieth; he, not being at enmity with him, nor seeking to harm him,

24. then shall the assembly judge, between him that smote and the blood-redeemer,—according to these regulations;

25. and the assembly shall rescue the manslayer out of the hand of the blood-redeemer, and the assembly shall restore him unto his city of refuge whither he had fled,—and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who hath been anointed with the hallowing oil.

26. But if the man-slayer, go out, of the bounds of his city of refuge, whereinto he hath fled;

27. and the blood-redeemer, find him, outside the bounds of his city of refuge, then may the blood-redeemer slay the slayer, without being guilty of blood;

28. for in his city of refuge, should he have remained, until the death of the high priest,—and, after the death of the high priest, might he have returned into the land which he doth possess.

29. So shall these serve you as a regulative statute unto your generations,—wheresoever ye may dwell.

30. Whosoever taketh away life, at the mouth of witnesses, shall, the slayer be slain,—but, one witness, shall not testify against a person, to put him to death.

31. And ye shall accept no ransom for the life of him that slayeth, if he have unlawfully caused death,—but he, must surely be put to death.

32. And ye shall accept no ransom for him that hath fled to his city of refuge, if he should return to dwell in the land before the death of the priest.

33. So shall ye not pollute the land wherein ye are, for blood, doth pollute the land, and for the land, no propitiatory-covering can be made, as touching blood, that is shed therein, save with the blood of him that shed it;

34. thou must not then make unclean the land wherein, ye, are dwelling, in the midst of which, I, have my habitation; for, I,—Yahweh, am making my habitation in the midst of the sons of Israel.  

## Numbers 36

1. Then came near the heads of fathers, belonging to the family of the sons of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, out of the families of the sons of Joseph,—and spake before Moses, and before the princes, heads of fathers belonging to the sons of Israel;

2. and they said—Unto my lord, did Yahweh give command, to bestow the land as an inheritance, by lot, unto the sons of Israel,—my lord, therefore, was commanded by Yahweh, to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

3. When, therefore, unto any one from among the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, they become wives their inheritance shall disappear out of the inheritance of our fathers, and be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall be received,—and so out of the lot of our inheritance, shall it disappear,

4. And when the jubilee shall come to the sons of Israel, then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall be received—and, out of the, inheritance of the tribe of our fathers, shall their inheritance disappear. 

5.  Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel, at the bidding of Yahweh saying,—A right thing, are, the tribe of the sons of Joseph, speaking,

6. This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded, as to the daughters of Zelophehad saying: Unto whomsoever it may be good in their eyes, let them become wives,—save only unto the family of the tribe of their father, let them become wives.

7. So shall no inheritance belonging to the sons of Israel go round from tribe to tribe,—for the sons of Israel shall, each one, cleave, unto the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers,

8. And, every daughter possessing all inheritance from among the tribes of the sons of Israel, unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, shall become wife,—to the intent that the sons of Israel may possess each one the inheritance of his fathers;

9. and no inheritance go round from one tribe to another tribe,—for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cleave, each one unto his own inheritance.

10. As Yahweh commanded Moses, so, did the daughters of Zelophehad.

11. Thus then did Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milchah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, become wives, unto the sons of their father’s brethren.

12. Unto men from among the families of the son of Manasseh son of Joseph, became they wives,—and so their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father.

13. These are the commandments and the regulations which Yahweh gave in charge, by the hand of Moses, unto the sons of Israel,—in the waste plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho.
