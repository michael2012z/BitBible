# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul and Silvanus and Timothy—unto the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ,—favour unto you, and peace! 

2.  We are giving thanks unto God continually, concerning you all, making, mention, in our prayers,

3. Unceasingly, remembering—your work of faith and labour of love and endurance of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father:

4. Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election,—

5. How that, our glad-message, came not unto you, in word only, but also in power, and in Holy Spirit, and in much assurance,—even as ye know what manner of men we became unto you, for your sake; 

6.  And, ye, became, imitators of us, and of the Lord, giving welcome unto the word, in much tribulation, with joy of Holy Spirit;

7. So that ye became an ensample unto all who were coming to the faith, in Macedonia and in Achaia:

8. From you, in fact, hath sounded forth the word of the Lord—not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but, in every place, your faith which is toward God, hath gone forth, so that, no need, have we to be saying anything;

9. For, they themselves, concerning us, do tell—what manner of entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned unto God from the idols—to be serving a living and true God,

10. And awaiting his Son out of the heavens—whom he raised from among the dead,—Jesus: Who is to rescue us out of the anger that is coming.  

## 1 Thessalonians 2

1. For, yourselves, know, brethren, our entrance which was unto you—that it hath not proved void;

2. But, though we had previously suffered, and been insulted, even as ye know, in Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the glad-message of God with much conflict.

3. For, our exhortation, is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,

4. But, even as we have been approved by God, to be entrusted with the glad-message, so, we speak,—not as, unto men, giving pleasure, but unto God—who proveth our hearts.

5. For neither at any time were we found, using words of flattery,—even as ye know, nor a pretext for greed—God, is witness!

6. Nor, of men, seeking glory—either from you, or from others, though we could have assumed, dignity, as Apostles of Christ; 

7.  But we became gentle in your midst,—as though, a nursing mother, had been cherishing her own children:

8. Thus, yearning after you, we could have been well-pleased to impart unto you—not only the glad-message of God, but, our own lives also,—because, very dear to us, had ye become.

9. For ye remember, brethren, our toil and hardship: night and day, working, so as not to be a burden unto any of you, we proclaimed unto you the glad-message of God,

10. Ye, are witnesses—God also, how kindly and righteously and blamelessly, unto you who were believing, we were found to behave;

11. Even as ye know how, unto each one of you, we were as a father unto his own children, consoling you, and soothing, and calling to witness,—

12. To the end ye might be walking in a manner worthy of God, who is calling you unto his own kingdom and glory, 

13.  And, for this cause, we, are also giving thanks unto God unceasingly, that, when ye received a spoken word from us—which was God’s, ye welcomed it—not as a human word, but, even as it truly is, a divine word,—which is also inwardly working itself in you who believe.

14. For, ye, became, imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea, in Christ Jesus, in that, the same things, ye, also suffered by your own fellow-countrymen, even as, they, also by the Jews:

15. Who have both slain the, Lord, Jesus—and the prophets, and, us, have persecuted, and, unto God, are displeasing, and, unto all men, are contrary,—

16. Hindering us from speaking, unto the nations, that they might be saved, to the filling up of their own sins, continually; but anger hath overtaken them at length. 

17.  Now, we, brethren, having been bereaved away from you, for the season of an hour,—in presence, not in heart, gave more abundant diligence, your face, to behold, with much longing;

18. Wherefore, we desired to come unto you—even, I, Paul, both once and again,—and, Satan, thwarted us.

19. For what shall be our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? Shall not even, ye, before our Lord Jesus, in his Presence?

20. Ye, in fact, are our glory and joy.  

## 1 Thessalonians 3

1. Wherefore, no longer concealing our anxiety, we were well-pleased to be left in Athens, alone,

2. And sent Timothy—our brother, and God’s minister in the glad-message of the Christ—that he might confirm and console you over your faith,

3. That, no one, might be shrinking back in these tribulations. For ye, yourselves, know, that, hereunto, are we appointed;

4. For, even when we were with you, we told you beforehand—we are destined to suffer tribulation! even as it also came to pass, and ye know.

5. For this cause, I also, no longer concealing my anxiety, sent, that I might get to know your faith, lest by any means he that tempteth, should have tempted you, and, in vain, should have been our toil. 

6.  But, when, just now, Timothy came unto us, from you, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love,—and that ye have good remembrance of us, continually, longing to see, us,—even as, we also, to see you,

7. For this cause, were we consoled, brethren, over you, in all our necessity and tribulation, through your faith;

8. Because, now, we live,—if only, ye, stand fast in the Lord.

9. For what thanksgiving can we render back, unto God, concerning you, on occasion of all the joy wherewith we rejoice, for your sakes, before our God?—

10. Night and day, making very abundant entreaties, that we may see your face, and fit in the things which are lacking in your faith? 

11.  Now may, our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus, make straight our way unto you:

12. And, you, may the Lord cause to abound and excel in your love one toward another, and toward all,—even as, we, do toward you:

13. To the end he may confirms your hearts, faultless in holiness, before our God and Father, in the Presence of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.  

## 1 Thessalonians 4

1. For the rest, brethren, we request and exhort you, in our Lord Jesus, [that], even as ye received from us, how ye must needs walk and please God,—even as ye also do walk, that ye would abound still more.

2. For ye know what charges we gave you, through the Lord Jesus.

3. For, this, is a thing willed of God, your sanctification,—that ye should abstain from unchastity,

4. That ye should know, each one of you, how, of his own vessel, to possess himself in sanctification and honour:

5. Not with a passion of coveting,—just as even the nations who know not God,—

6. Not over-reaching and defrauding, in the matter, his brother; because, an avenger, is the Lord, concerning all these things,—even as we before told you, and solemnly called you to witness.

7. For God did not call us, with a permission of impurity, but, in sanctification.

8. Therefore, indeed, he that disregardeth—it is, not a man, he disregardeth, but God,—Who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you. 

9.  But, concerning brotherly love—no need, have ye, that we be writing unto you; for, ye yourselves, are, God-taught, to the loving of one another;—

10. And, in fact, ye are doing it unto all the brethren [who are] in the whole of Macedonia; but we exhort you, brethren, to abound still more,

11. And to be ambitious to be quiet, and to be attending to your own affairs, and to be working with your hands,—even as, unto you, we gave charge—

12. That ye should walk reputably toward those without, and, of no one, have, need. 

13.  But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are falling asleep,—lest ye be sorrowing, even as the rest also, who are without hope;

14. For, if we believe that, Jesus, died, and rose again, so, also will, God, bring forth with him, them who have fallen asleep through Jesus;

15. For, this, unto you, do we say, by a word of the Lord,—that, we, the living who are left unto the Presence of the Lord, shall in nowise get before them who have fallen asleep;

16. Because, the Lord himself, with a word of command, with a chief-messenger’s voice, and with a trumpet of God, shall descend from heaven,—and, the dead in Christ, shall rise, first,

17. After that, we, the living who are left, together with them, shall be caught away, in clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:—and, thus, evermore, with the Lord, shall we be!

18. So then, be consoling one another with these words.  

## 1 Thessalonians 5

1. But, concerning the times and the seasons, brethren,—ye have, no need, that, unto you, anything be written;

2. For, ye yourselves, perfectly well know—that, the day of the Lord, as a thief in the night, so, cometh;

3. As soon as they begin to say—Peace! and safety! then, suddenly, upon them, cometh destruction,—just as the birth-throe unto her that is with child,—and in nowise shall they escape.

4. But, ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that, the day, upon you, as upon thieves, should lay hold;

5. For, all ye, are, sons of light, and sons of day,—we are not of night, nor of darkness: 

6.  Hence, then, let us not be sleeping, as the rest, but let us watch and be sober:—

7. For, they that sleep, by night, do sleep, and, they that drink, by night, do drink:—

8. But, we, being of the day, let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and, for helmet, the hope of salvation.

9. Because God did not appoint us unto anger, but unto acquiring salvation through our Lord Jesus [Christ]:—

10. Who died for us, in order that, whether we be watching or sleeping, together with him, we should live. 

11.  Wherefore be consoling one another, and building up, each the other,—even as ye are also doing.

12. Now we request you, brethren,—to know them who are toiling among you, and presiding over you, in the Lord, and admonishing you;

13. And to hold them in very high esteem, in love, their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves,

14. But we exhort you, brethren—admonish the disorderly, soothe them of little soul, help the weak, be longsuffering towards all:

15. See that none, evil for evil, unto any, do render: but, evermore, what is good, be pursuing, towards one another, and towards all: 

16.  Evermore, rejoice,

17. Unceasingly, pray,

18. In everything, give thanks,—for, this, is a thing willed of God, in Christ Jesus, towards you:

19. The Spirit, do not quench,

20. Prophesyings, do not despise,

21. [But], all things, put to the proof—what is comely, hold ye fast:

22. From every form of wickedness, abstain. 

23.  But, the God of peace himself, hallow you completely, and, entire, might your spirit, and soul, and body,—[so as to be] unblameable in the Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ,—be preserved!

24. Faithful, is he that is calling you,—who, also will perform.

25. Brethren! be praying for us [also].

26. Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.

27. I adjure you, by the Lord, that the letter be read unto all the brethren!

28. The favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with you.
