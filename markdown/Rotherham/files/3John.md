## 3 John 1

1. The elder, unto Gaius the beloved, whom, I, love in truth.

2. Beloved! concerning all things, I pray thou mayest be prospering, and be in health, even as, thy soul, is prospering, 

3.  For I rejoiced exceedingly, at brethren coming and bearing witness unto thy truth,—even as, thou, in truth, art walking.

4. I have no, greater, favour than these things, that I should be hearing that, my own children, in the truth, are walking.

5. Beloved! a faithful thing, art thou doing, whatsoever thou shalt accomplish for them that are brethren, and withal strangers,—

6. Who have borne witness to thy love before the assembly: whom thou wilt do, nobly, to set forward worthily of God.

7. For, in behalf of The Name, have they gone forth, taking, nothing, from them of the nations.

8. We, therefore ought to be sustaining such as these, that we may become, fellowworkers, with the truth. 

9.  I wrote something unto the assembly; but, he who is fond of taking the first place among them—Diotrephes, doth not make us welcome.

10. For this cause, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he is doing,—with wicked words, prating against us; and, not content with these, he neither, himself, maketh the brethren welcome, but, them who are minded [to do it], he forbiddeth, and, out of the assembly, doth cast [them] .

11. Beloved! be not thou imitating what is bad, but what is good. He that doeth good, is, of God: he that doeth what is bad, hath not seen God. 

12.  Unto Demetrius, hath witness been borne by all and by the truth itself; howbeit, we also, bear witness, and thou knowest that, our witness, is, true.

13. Many things, had I to write unto thee,—but I am unwilling, with ink and pen, to be writing;

14. I hope, however, straightway, to see thee, and, mouth to mouth, will we talk. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
