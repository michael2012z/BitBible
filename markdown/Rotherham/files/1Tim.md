## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus—by injunction of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope,—

2. unto Timothy, my true child in faith: favour, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. Even as I exhorted thee to remain in Ephesus, when I was journeying into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some—

4. Not to be teaching otherwise, nor yet to be giving heed to stories and endless genealogies,—the which, bring, arguings, rather than that stewardship of God which is with faith;— 

5.  Now, the end of the charge, is love—out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,—

6. Which some, missing, have turned them aside unto idle talk,

7. Desiring to be law-teachers,—not understanding, either what they say or whereof they confidently affirm.

8. Now we know that, excellent, is the law, if one put it to a lawful use:—

9. Knowing this—that, to a righteous man, law, doth not apply, but to the lawless and insubordinate, ungodly and sinful, irreligious and profane, smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers, murderers,

10. fornicators, sodomites, man-stealers, liars, false- swearers,—and, if anything else, unto the healthful teaching, is opposed;—

11. According to the glad-message of the glory of the happy God, with which entrusted am, I. 

12.  Grateful, am I unto him that empowered me, Christ Jesus our Lord, in that, faithful, he accounted me, putting me into ministry,—

13. Though, formerly, a defamer, and persecutor, and insulter; nevertheless mercy was shown me, because, without knowledge, I acted, in unbelief:

14. Yet exceeding abundant was the favour of our Lord, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.

15. Faithful, the saying! and, of all acceptance, worthy,—that, Christ Jesus, came into the world, sinners, to save: of whom, the chief, am, I;—

16. Nevertheless, on this account, was mercy shewn me,—that, in me, the chief, Christ Jesus might shew forth his entire longsuffering, for an ensample of them about to believe on him unto life age-abiding.

17. Now, unto the King of the ages,—incorruptible, invisible, alone God, be honour and glory, unto the ages of ages, Amen! 

18.  This charge, I commit unto thee, child Timothy, According to the prophecies, running before on thee, in order that thou mightest war, with them, the noble warfare.

19. Holding faith and a good conscience,—which some, thrusting from them, concerning their faith, have made shipwreck:—

20. Of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may be taught by discipline not to be defaming.  

## 1 Timothy 2

1. I exhort, therefore, first of all, that there be made—supplications, prayers, intercessions, thankgivings, in behalf of all men,

2. In behalf of kings, and all them who are, in eminent station; in order that, an undisturbed, and quiet life, we may lead, in all godliness and gravity:

3. This, is comely and acceptable before our Saviour God,

4. Who willeth, all men, to be saved, and, unto a personal knowledge of truth, to come;

5. For there is, one, God, one, mediator also, between God and men,—a man—Christ Jesus:

6. Who gave himself a ransom in behalf of all,—the testimony, in its own fit times:

7. Unto which, I, have been appointed proclaimer and apostle—Truth I speak, I utter no falsehood—a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.

8. I am minded, therefore, that—the men in every place be offering prayer, uplifting hands of lovingkindness, apart from anger and disputings; 

9.  In the same way, that, the women, in seemly attire, with modesty and sober-mindedness, be adorning themselves,—not with plaitings and ornamentation of gold, or with pearls, or with costly apparel,—

10. But, which becometh women promising godliness, through means of good works.

11. Let, a woman, in quietness, be learning in all submission;

12. But, teaching—unto a woman, I do not permit, nor yet to have authority over a man,—but to be in quietness;

13. For, Adam, first was formed, then Eve,

14. And, Adam, was not deceived, whereas, the woman, having been wholly deceived, hath come to be, in transgression;

15. She shall be saved, however, through means of the child-bearing,—if they abide in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobermindedness. Faithful, the saying.  

## 1 Timothy 3

1. If anyone, for oversight, is eager, a noble work, doth he covet:—

2. It is needful, then, for, the overseer, to be irreproachable, a husband, of one wife, sober, of sound mind, orderly, hospitable, apt in teaching,

3. Not given to wine, not ready to wound, but considerate, averse to contention, not fond of money,

4. Over his own house, presiding, well, having, children, in submission, with all dignity;

5. Whereas, if anyone, over his own house, cannot, preside, how, of an assembly of God, shall he take care?

6. Not a new convert, lest, being beclouded, into the sentence of the adversary, he fall;

7. It is needful, moreover, to have, an honourable testimony also, from them who are without, lest, into reproach, he fall, and the snare of the adversary. 

8.  Ministers, in the same way,—dignified, not double-tongued, not, to much wine, given, not greedy of base gain,

9. Holding the sacred secret of the faith in a pure conscience;

10. But let, these also, be proved first, then, let them be ministering, being, unaccusable:

11. Wives, in the same way,—dignified, not given to intrigue, sober, faithful in all things.

12. Let, ministers, be husbands of, one wife, over children, presiding, well, and over their own houses;

13. For, they who have ministered well, a good degree for themselves, are acquiring, and great freedom of speech in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 

14.  These things, unto thee, I am writing, hoping to come [unto thee] shortly,—

15. But, if I should tarry, that thou mayest know—how it behoveth, in a house of God, to behave oneself,—the which, is an assembly of a Living God, a pillar and basement of the truth;—

16. And, confessedly great, is the sacred secret of godliness,—Who was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, was made visible unto messengers, was proclaimed among nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.  

## 1 Timothy 4

1. Howbeit, the Spirit, expressly saith—that, in later seasons, some will revolt from the faith, giving heed unto seducing spirits, and unto teachings of demons—

2. in hypocrisy, speaking falsehood, [of demons] cauterised in their own conscience,—

3. Forbidding to marry, [commanding] to abstain from foods which, God, created to be received with thanksgiving by them who believe and personally know the truth;

4. Because, every creature of God, is good, and nothing to be cast away, if, with thanksgiving, it be received,—

5. For it is hallowed by the word of God and intercession, 

6.  These things, submitting to the brethren, thou shall be, a noble, minister of Christ Jesus, nourishing thyself with the words of the faith, and of the noble teaching which thou hast closely studied.

7. But, from the profane and old-wives’ stories, excuse thyself, and be training thyself unto godliness;

8. For, the bodily training, for little, is profitable, whereas, godliness, for all things is profitable,—having, promise, of life—the present and the coming.

9. Faithful, the saying! and, of all acceptance, worthy;

10. For, to this end, are we toiling and contending, because we have set our hope on a Living God, Who is Saviour of all men—specially, of such as believe.

11. Be giving these things in charge, and be teaching:—

12. Let, no one, despise, thy youth, but, an ensample, become thou of the faithful,—in discourse, in behaviour, in love, in faith, in chastity.

13. While I am coming, be giving heed—to the reading, to the exhorting, to the teaching:

14. Be not careless of the gift of favour, that is in thee, which was given thee through means of prophesying, along with a laying on of the hands of the eldership.

15. These things, be thy care, in these things, be thou, that, thine advancement, may be, manifest, unto all:

16. Be giving heed to thyself, and to thy teaching,—abide still in them; for, this doing, both, thyself, shalt thou save, and them that hearken to thee.  

## 1 Timothy 5

1. An elderly man, do not thou reprimand, but beseech him, as [though he were thy] father,—younger men, as brothers,

2. Elderly women, as mothers, younger women, as sisters, in all chastity. 

3.  Widows, honour thou—who indeed are widows:—

4. Howbeit, if, any widow, hath, children or grandchildren, let them be learning—first, unto their own house, to be shewing reverence, and, returns, to be making unto their progenitors; for, this, is acceptable before God;

5. But, she who is indeed a widow, and is left alone, hath turned her hope towards God, and is giving attendance unto the supplications and the prayers, night and day,—

6. Whereas, she that runneth riot, while living, is, dead:

7. And, these things, be giving in charge, that, without reproach, they may be;

8. If, however, anyone, for his own, and specially them of his household, taketh not forethought, his faith, hath he denied, and is worse, than one without faith!

9. Let, a widow, be put on the list—having become, not less than sixty years old, one man’s, wife,

10. In noble works, being well-attested;—if she hath nourished children, if she hath shewn hospitality, if, saints feet, she hath washed, if, them who were in tribulation, she hath succoured, if, in every good, work she hath followed on:

11. But, younger widows, decline thou; for, as soon as they wax wanton against the Christ, to marry, are they determined,—

12. Having, as sentence,—that, their first faith, they have set at nought;

13. At the same time, to be idlers, are they learning, going about from house to house; and, not only idlers, but, gossips, also, and, busybodies,—saying the things they ought not,

14. I am minded, therefore, that, the younger ones, marry, bear children, be mistress of the house,—giving, no single occasion, unto the opposer, as a cause, of reviling;

15. For, already, some have turned aside after Satan:

16. If any, believing woman, hath widows, let her be giving them succour, and not suffer the assembly to be burdened,—that, them who are indeed widows, it may itself succour. 

17.  Let, the well presiding elders, of double honour, be accounted worthy, especially they who toil in discourse and teaching;

18. For the scripture saith—A threshing ox, shalt thou not muzzle, and—Worthy, is the workman, of his hire.

19. Against an elder, entertain not, an accusation, except at, [the mouth of] two, or three, witnesses;

20. But, them who are sinning, before all, do thou reprove, that, the rest also, may have, fear:—

21. I adjure thee, before God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen messengers, that, these things, thou observe, apart from prejudgment, doing, nothing, by partiality.

22. Hands, suddenly, upon no one, lay, neither have fellowship with sins of strangers: thyself, keep, chaste:—

23. No longer, be a water-drinker, but, of a little wine, make use, because of thy stomach and thy, frequent, sicknesses.

24. Some men’s sins, are, openly evident, leading on into judgment, with some, however, they even follow after;

25. In the same way, the noble works also, are openly evident,—and, they that are otherwise, cannot be hid.  

## 1 Timothy 6

1. Let, as many as are servants under a yoke, be counting, their own masters, worthy, of all honour, lest, the name of God and the teaching, be defamed.

2. They, however, that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are, brethren but, the more, be doing them service, because, believing and beloved, are they who, from the good workmanship, receive advantage. These things, be teaching, and exhorting:—

3. If anyone doth otherwise teach, and doth not adhere to healthful discourses—those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching that is, according to godliness,

4. He is beclouded, knowing, nothing, rightly, but is diseased about questionings, and word-battles—out of which spring envy, strife, defamations, wicked surmising,

5. incessant quarrellings of men wholly corrupt in their mind and bereft of the truth,—supposing godliness to be, a means of gain! 

6.  Now it is a great means of gain—godliness, with a sufficiency of one’s own;

7. For, nothing, brought we into the world, neither, to take anything out, are we able;—

8. And, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content;

9. But, they who are determined to be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful covetings, the which, sink men into ruin and destruction,—

10. For, a root of all the vices, is the love of money, which, some, being eager for, have been seduced from the faith, and have pierced, themselves, about with many pangs.

11. But, thou, O man of God! from these things, flee! and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness;

12. Be contesting the noble contest of the faith,—lay hold of the age-abiding life—unto which thou wast called, and didst make the noble confession before many witnesses. 

13.  I charge thee, before God, who engendereth life in all things, and Christ Jesus, who, before Pontius Pilate, witnessed the noble confession,

14. That thou keep the commandment without spot, free from reproach, until the forthshining of our Lord Jesus Christ—

15. Which, in its own fit times, the happy and only Potentate will shew—the King of them that reign, and Lord of them that wield lordship,

16. Who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable,—Whom no man hath seen—nor can see: unto whom, be honour and might age-abiding. Amen.

17. Upon them who are rich in the present age, lay thou charge—not to be high-minded, nor to have set their hope on, riches’, uncertainty,—but on God, who offereth us all things richly for enjoying,

18. To be doing good, to be rich in noble works, to be, generous in giving, ready for fellowship,—

19. Treasuring up for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold on the life [which is life] indeed.

20. O Timothy! that which hath been entrusted, do thou guard, avoiding the profane pratings and oppositions of falsely named knowledge,—

21. Which, some professing, concerning the faith, have missed the mark! Favour be with you.
