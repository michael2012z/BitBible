## Psalms 1

1. How happy the man, who hath not walked in the counsel of the lawless,—and, in the way of sinners, hath not stood, and, in the seat of scoffers, hath not sat;

2. But, in the law of Yahweh, is his delight,—and, in his law, doth he talk with himself day and night.

3. So doth he become like a tree planted by streams of waters,—that yieldeth, its fruit, in its season, whose leaf, also doth not wither, and, whatsoever he doeth, prospereth. 

4.  Not so, the lawless,—but as chaff which is driven about by the wind:

5. For this cause, shall the lawless not stand in the judgment,—nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

6. For Yahweh doth acknowledge the way of the righteous; but, the way of the lawless, shall vanish.  

## Psalms 2

1. Wherefore have nations assembled in tumult? Or should, peoples, mutter an empty thing?

2. The kings of earth take their station, and, grave men, have met by appointment together,—against Yahweh, and against his Anointed One [saying] :

3. Let us break asunder their bonds,—and cast from us their cords!

4. He that sitteth in the heavens, will laugh,—My Lord, will mock at them:

5. Then, will he speak unto them in his anger, and, in his wrath, confound them:

6. Yet, I, have installed my king,—on Zion my holy mountain. 

7.  Let me tell of a decree,—Yahweh, hath said unto me, My son, thou art, I, to-day, have begotten thee:

8. Ask of me, and let me give nations as thine inheritance, and, as thy possession, the ends of the earth:

9. Thou shalt shepherd them with a sceptre of iron,—as a potter’s vessel, shalt thou dash them in pieces. 

10.  Now, therefore, ye kings, show your prudence, Be admonished, ye judges of earth:

11. Serve Yahweh with reverence, and exult with trembling:

12. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish by the way, for soon might be kindled his anger,—How happy are all who seek refuge in him!  

## Psalms 3

1. A Melody of David, when he fled from before Absolom his son. Yahweh! how have mine adversaries multiplied, Multitudes, are rising against me;

2. Multitudes, are saying of my soul,—No salvation for him in God. [Selah.]

3. But, thou, Yahweh, art a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter up of my head. 

4.  With my voice—unto Yahweh, do I cry, and he hath answered me out of his holy mountain. [Selah.]

5. I, laid me down and slept,—I awoke, Surely, Yahweh, sustaineth me!

6. I will not be afraid of myriads of people, who, round about, have set themselves against me.

7. Rise! Yahweh, Save me, my God. Surely thou hast smitten all my foes on the cheekbone, The teeth of the lawless, hast thou broken.

8. To Yahweh, belongeth Salvation! Upon thy people, be thy blessing. [Selah.]  

## Psalms 4

1. To the Chief Musician: with stringed instruments. A Melody of David. When I cry, answer me, O mine own righteous God, In a strait place, thou hast made room for me, Show me favour, and hear my prayer.

2. Ye sons of the great! how long, turning my glory to contempt, will ye love emptiness, will ye seek falsehood? [Selah.]

3. Know ye, then, that Yahweh hath set apart the man of lovingkindness for himself: Yahweh, will hear, when I cry to him.

4. Be deeply moved, but do not sin,—Ponder in your own heart upon your bed, and be silent. [Selah.]

5. Sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness; and put your trust in Yahweh. 

6.  Multitudes, are saying, Who will show us prosperity? Lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance, O Yahweh.

7. Thou hast put gladness in my heart,—beyond the season when, their corn and their new wine, have increased.

8. In peace, will I lay me down and at once sleep; for, thou, Yahweh alone, wilt cause me, in security, to dwell.  

## Psalms 5

1. To the Chief Musician. For the Flutes. A Melody of David. To my words, give ear, O Yahweh, Understand thou my softly murmured prayer:

2. Attend to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for, unto thee, do I pray.

3. O Yahweh! in the morning, shalt thou hear my voice, In the morning, will I set in order unto thee, and keep watch;

4. For, not a GOD finding pleasure in lawlessness, art thou, and wrong can be no guest of thine:

5. Boasters, shall not station themselves, before thine eyes,—Thou hatest all workers of iniquity:

6. Thou wilt destroy them who speak falsehood,—The man of bloodshed and of deceit, Yahweh abhorreth. 

7.  But, I, in the abounding of thy lovingkindness, will enter thy house, I will bow down towards thy holy temple, in reverence of thee:

8. O Yahweh! lead me in thy righteousness, because of mine adversaries, Make even, before me, thy way:

9. For in his mouth is nothing worthy of trust, Their inward purpose, is engulphing ruin,—An opened sepulchre, is their throat, With their tongue, speak they smooth things.

10. Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall by their own counsels,—Into the throng of their own transgressions, thrust them down, For they have rebelled against thee:—

11. That all may rejoice who seek refuge in thee, to times age-abiding, may shout in triumph, that thou wilt protect them, and they may leap for joy in thee who are lovers of thy Name.

12. For, thou, wilt bless the righteous man, O Yahweh, As with an all-covering shield—with good pleasure, wilt thou encompass him.  

## Psalms 6

1. To the Chief Musician, with stringed Instruments upon the eighth. A Melody of David. O Yahweh! do not, in thine anger, correct me, nor, in thy wrath, chastise me.

2. Show me favour, O Yahweh, for languishing am I: Heal me, O Yahweh,—for dismayed are my bones:

3. Yea, my soul, is dismayed greatly, Thou, then, O Yahweh—how long?

4. Return, O Yahweh, deliver my soul, Save me, for the sake of thy lovingkindness;

5. For, in death, is no remembrance of thee,—In hades, who shall give thanks unto thee?

6. I am weary with my sighing, I flood, through the whole night, my couch,—With my tears, I cause, my bed, to dissolve:

7. My face, is all sunken with sorrow,—it hath aged, because of all mine adversaries. 

8.  Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for Yahweh hath heard the voice of my weeping:

9. Yahweh, hath heard my supplication, Yahweh, will receive, my prayer.

10. Let all my foes, turn pale and be greatly dismayed, Again let them turn pale in a moment.  

## Psalms 7

1. Ode of David: which he sang unto Yahweh, on account of the words of Cush the Benjamite. O Yahweh my God, in thee, have I sought refuge,—Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me:

2. Lest one tear, as a lion, my soul,—and there be no deliverer to rescue.

3. O Yahweh my God, If I have done this, If there hath been perversity in my hands:

4. If I have requited my friend with wrong,—or have oppressed mine adversary without need,

5. Let an enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, that he may tread down, to the earth, my life,—and, mine honour—in the dust, he may cause to dwell. [Selah.]

6. Rise! Yahweh! in thine anger, Lift thyself up, because of the haughty outbursts of mine adversaries, Stir up for me the justice thou hast commanded:

7. When, the assembly of peoples, gather round thee, then, above it—on high, do thou return!

8. Yahweh, will judge the peoples,—Do me justice, O Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity upon me,

9. Let the wrong of the lawless, I pray thee, come to an end, and establish thou him that is righteous,—for, a trier of hearts and reins, is God the righteous one. 

10.  My shield, is held by God, who is ready to save the upright in heart:

11. A God to vindicate the righteous,—And yet a God to be indignant throughout every day.

12. If he turn not, his sword, will he whet,—his bow, hath he bent, and made ready:

13. But, for himself, hath he made ready the weapons so deadly, His arrows, he, so fiery, would make:

14. Lo! he gendereth trouble, and conceiveth mischief, but giveth birth to a disappointment:

15. A pit, he cut out, and digged it, and then fell into the ditch he had made:

16. His mischief, turneth back, on his own head,—and, on his own crown, his violence, descendeth.

17. I will praise Yahweh according to his righteousness,—and will praise in song the Name of Yahweh Most High.  

## Psalms 8

1. To the Chief Musician. On "the Gittith." A Melody of David. O Yahweh, our Lord! How majestic is thy Name, in all the earth, Who hast set thy splendour upon the heavens.

2. Out of the mouth of children and sucklings, hast thou laid a foundation of strength,—because of thine adversaries, to make foe and avenger be still. 

3.  When I view thy heavens, the work, of thy fingers, moon and stars, which thou hast established,

4. What was weak man, that thou shouldst make mention of him? or the son of the earthborn, that thou shouldst set him in charge?

5. That thou shouldst make him little less than messengers of God, with glory and honour, shouldst crown him?

6. Shouldst give him dominion over the works of thy hands,—All things, shouldst have put under his feet:

7. Sheep and oxen, all of them,—yea even the beasts of the field;

8. The bird of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea,— the passer-by on the paths of the seas?

9. O Yahweh, our Lord! How majestic is thy Name, in all the earth.  

## Psalms 9

1. To the Chief Musician. On "Muthlabben." A Melody of David. I will praise Yahweh with all my heart, I will recount all thy wonderful doings:

2. I will rejoice and exult in thee, I will praise in song, thy Name, O most High.

3. When mine enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished from before thee;

4. For thou hast executed my right and my cause, Thou hast sat on the throne, judging righteously:

5. Thou hast rebuked the nations, Thou hast destroyed the lawless one, Their name, hast thou wiped out, to times age-abiding and beyond.

6. O enemy! complete are the desolations, evermore,—even cities, hast thou uprooted, The memory of, them, hath perished.

7. But, Yahweh, unto times age-abiding, will sit, Ready for judgment, is his throne;

8. And, he, will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to peoples, in uprightness.

9. Thus be Yahweh a refuge for the crushed one, a refuge for times of destitution:

10. Thus let them who know thy Name, put confidence in thee, that thou hast not forsaken the searchers for thee, O Yahweh. 

11.  Sing ye praise to Yahweh, who is seated in Zion, Tell among the peoples his doings.

12. When he was making inquisition for blood, of them, had he remembrance, he forgat not the outcry of the oppressed.

13. Show me favour, O Yahweh! Behold my humiliation due to them who hate me, Lift me on high out of the gates of death;

14. That I may recount all thy praises, In the gates of the daughter of Zion, may exult in thy salvation.

15. The nations, have sunk, in the pit they had made, In the net which they had hidden, is caught their own foot.

16. To be known is Yahweh, by the sentence he hath executed, By the doing of his own hands, is he about to strike down the lawless one. [Resounding music. Selah.]

17. The lawless, shall return, to hades, all nations forgetful of God.

18. For, not always, shall the needy, be forgotten,—[nor,] the hope of the oppressed, perish for ever.

19. Rise! Yahweh! let man not prevail, let the nations be judged before thee.

20. Appoint, O Yahweh, a terror for them,—Let the nations know [that] they are men. [Selah.]  

## Psalms 10

1. Wherefore, O Yahweh, shouldst thou stand afar off? [Wherefore] hide thyself, in times of destitution?

2. In the pride of the lawless one, he hotly pursueth the poor, let them be caught in the plots which they have devised!

3. For the lawless one hath boasted over the longing of his soul, and, the robber, hath blasphemed Yahweh.

4. The lawless one, in the loftiness of his countenance, will not enquire, God is not in any of his plots:

5. His ways are firm at all times, On high, are thy righteous regulations, out of his sight, As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them:

6. He hath said in his heart, I shall not be shaken,—From generation to generation, shall I be in no misfortune.

7. With cursing, his mouth is full, and with deceptions and oppression, Under his tongue, are trouble and mischief:

8. He abideth in the lurking-place of villages, In the hiding-places, he murdereth the innocent,—His eyes, for the unfortunate, are on the watch:

9. He lieth in wait in a hiding-place, like a lion in his covert, He lieth in wait to catch the humbled, He catcheth the humbled, by drawing him into his net:

10. He croucheth, he lieth down, then falleth he with his strong claws upon the unfortunate.

11. He hath said in his heart, GOD hath forgotten,—He hath veiled his face, Oh he hath never seen! 

12.  Arise! Yahweh! O GOD! raise thy hand,—Do not forget the patient!

13. Wherefore hath the lawless one blasphemed God? He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require [it] !

14. Thou hast seen! For, thou, mischief and misery, dost discern, to requite with thine own hand, Unto thee, doth, the unfortunate one, give himself up, To the fatherless, thou thyself, hast become a helper.

15. Shatter thou the arm of the lawless one, And, as for the wrongful, wilt thou not enquire for his lawlessness—wilt thou not find [it] ?

16. Yahweh, is king, to times age-abiding and beyond, The nations have perished out of his land.

17. The longing of the patient, thou hast heard, O Yahweh, Thou wilt establish their heart, Thou wilt make attentive thine ear:

18. To vindicate the fatherless and the crushed, A man of the earth, shall, no further, cause terror!  

## Psalms 11

1. To the Chief Musician. David’s. In Yahweh, have I sought refuge. How can ye say to my soul, Flee to a mountain like a little bird;

2. For lo! the lawless, bend the bow They have fixed their arrow upon the string, To shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart:

3. When the pillars are overthrown, What could, a righteous man, do? 

4.  Yahweh, is in his holy temple As for Yahweh, in the heavens, is his throne, His eyes, behold—His eyelashes test the sons of men.

5. Yahweh, putteth, the righteous, to the test,—But the lawless one and the lover of violence, his soul doth hate.

6. He will rain upon the lawless live-coals, Fire and brimstone and a burning wind, are the portion of their cup.

7. For righteous is Yahweh Righteousness, he loveth, the upright, shall behold his face.  

## Psalms 12

1. To the Chief Musician. On the Octave. A Melody of David. O save Yahweh, for the man of lovingkindness, is no more, for the faithful, have vanished, from among the sons of men.

2. Deception, speak they, every one with his neighbour,—with lips uttering smooth things—with a heart and a heart, do they speak.

3. May Yahweh cut off All the lips that utter smooth things,—the tongue that speaketh swelling words;

4. Them who say—With our tongue, will we prevail, our lips, are our own, who is our master?

5. Because of violence done to the poor, because of the crying of the needy, Now, will I arise! O may Yahweh say,—I will place [him] in safety—let him puff at him!

6. The words of Yahweh, are words, that are pure, silver refined in a crucible of earth, purified seven times!

7. Thou, O Yahweh, wilt keep them,—Thou wilt guard him, from this generation unto times age-abiding.

8. On every side, the lawless, march about,—when worthlessness is exalted by the sons of men.  

## Psalms 13

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. How long, O Yahweh, wilt thou wholly forget me? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

2. How long shall I lay up cares within my soul, sorrow in my heart, day by day? How long shall mine enemy lift himself up over me?

3. Have regard! answer me O Yahweh my God,—Light up mine eyes, lest I sleep on into death:

4. Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed over him! and, mine adversaries, exult, that I totter.

5. But, I, in thy lovingkindness, have put my trust, My heart shall exult in thy salvation:

6. I will sing to Yahweh, for he hath dealt beautifully with me.  

## Psalms 14

1. To the Chief Musician. David’s. The impious hath said in his heart—There is no God! They have acted corruptly, they have done an abominable deed, there is none that doeth good.

2. Yahweh, out of the heavens, looked down over the sons of men,—to see whether there was one that showed wisdom, enquiring after God:—

3. The whole, have turned aside, Together have they become tainted,—There is none that doeth good, not so much as, one! 

4.  Are all the workers of iniquity, without knowledge? devouring my people [as] they devour food! Upon Yahweh, have they not called.

5. There have they been in great dread, because, God, is in the circle of the righteous man.

6. The purpose of the poor, ye would put to shame, because, Yahweh, is his refuge.

7. Oh that, out of Zion, were granted the salvation of Israel! When Yahweh bringeth back the captives of his people, Jacob, shall exult, Israel, be glad.  

## Psalms 15

1. A Melody of David. O Yahweh! Who shall be a guest in thy tent? Who shall abide in thy holy mountain?

2. He that walketh without blame, and doeth what is right, and speaketh truth with his heart;

3. Hath not carried slander on his tongue, hath not done his friend a wrong, nor, a reproach, taken up against his neighbour;

4. Despised in his sight, is the reprobate, but, them who revere Yahweh, he doth honour, he hath sworn to his neighbour, and will not change;

5. His silver, hath he not put out on interest, nor, a bribe against the innocent, hath he taken. He that doeth these things, shall not be shaken unto times age-abiding.  

## Psalms 16

1. A Precious Psalm of David. Preserve me, O GOD, for I have sought refuge in thee.

2. Thou hast said unto Yahweh, My Lord, art thou! My goodness, mounteth not unto thee.

3. It belongeth unto the holy ones, whom, in his own land, Yahweh, ennobleth, In whom is all his delight

4. They multiply their idols—another, have they purchased! I will not pour out their drink-offerings of blood, nor will I take up their names on my lips.

5. Yahweh, is mine allotted portion and my cup, Thou, art maintaining my lot.

6. The lines, have fallen unto me, in pleasant places, Verily an inheritance that delighteth me.

7. I will bless Yahweh, who hath counselled me,—Surely, by night, shall mine impulses admonish me. 

8.  I have set Yahweh before me continually, because he is on my right hand, I shall not be shaken!

9. Therefore, hath my heart rejoiced, and mine honour exulted, Yea, my flesh, shall settle down securely;

10. For thou wilt not abandon my soul to hades, neither wilt thou suffer thy man of lovingkindness, to see corruption:

11. Thou wilt cause me to know, the path of life,—Fulness of joys before thee, Pleasures at thy right hand evermore.  

## Psalms 17

1. A Prayer of David. Hear, O Yahweh, the right, Attend to my loud cry, Give ear unto my prayer, on lips that would not deceive:

2. From before thee, let my sentence come forth, Thine eyes, behold with equity.

3. Thou hast tested my heart, hast made inspection by night, hast refined me until thou couldst find nothing, Had I devised evil, my mouth should not have transgressed:

4. As for the workings of men, By the word of thy lips, have, I, taken heed of the paths of the violent one.

5. Thou hast held fast my goings on to thy ways, My footsteps have not been shaken:

6. I, have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O GOD,—Incline thine ear unto me, Hear thou my speech:

7. Let thy lovingkindness be distinguished, thou Saviour of such as seek refuge from them who lift themselves up against thy right hand. 

8.  Guard me, as the pupil of the eye,—Under the shadow of thy wings, wilt thou hide me:

9. From the face of lawless ones who have treated me with violence, the foes of my soul, who come round against me:

10. Their own fat [heart], have they shut up,—With their mouth, have they spoken proudly.

11. As for our own goings, now, have they surrounded us,—Their eyes, they fix, bending to the earth:

12. His likeness, is as a lion, that longeth to rend, and as a young lion, lurking in secret places.

13. Rise, Yahweh! Confront his face, Bring him down, Deliver my soul from the lawless one [who is] thy sword:

14. From men [who are] thy hand, O Yahweh, From the men of this age, whose portion, is among the living, and, with thy treasure, thou fillest their bosom,—They must be satisfied with sons, And must leave their abundance to their children:—

15. I, in righteousness, shall behold thy face, Shall be satisfied when awakened by a vision of thee.  

## Psalms 18

1. To the chief Musician. Of the servant of Yahweh, of David,—who spake unto Yahweh the words of this song,—in the day when Yahweh had rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul; and he said:— I will love thee, O Yahweh my strength!

2. Yahweh, was my mountain crag and my stronghold, and my deliverer: My GOD, was my rock, I sought refuge in him, My shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower.

3. As one worthy to be praised, called I on Yahweh,—And, from my foes, was I saved.

4. The meshes of death encompassed me, The torrents of perdition, made me afraid;

5. The meshes of hades, had surrounded me, The snares of death, had confronted me,

6. In my distress, called I on Yahweh, And, unto my God, made outcry for help, He heard, out of his temple, my voice, And my outcry for help came before him—entered into his ears!

7. Then did the earth shake and quake, Even, the foundations of the mountains, were deeply moved, Yea they did shake, because he was angry.

8. There went up smoke in his nostrils, and, a fire out of his mouth, devoured, Live coals, were kindled from it:

9. Then he stretched out the heaven, and came down,—and, thick gloom, was under his feet;

10. Then he rode on a cherub, and flew, and darted on the wings of the wind;

11. Made darkness his hiding-place, Round about him—his pavilion, Darkness of waters, clouds of vapours.

12. Out of the brightness before him, his clouds rolled along, hail, and live coals of fire.

13. Then did Yahweh thunder in the heavens, and the Highest uttered his voice,—hail, and live coals of fire.

14. And he sent forth his arrows and scattered them, yea, lightnings, he shot out, and confused them.

15. Then appeared the channels of waters, were uncovered the foundations of the world,—At thy rebuke O Yahweh, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

16. He sent from on high, he took me,—he drew me out of many waters.

17. He rescued me from my foe, in his might, and from them who hated me, because they were too strong for me:

18. They confronted me, in the day of my necessity, Then became Yahweh my stay:

19. And brought me out, into a large place, he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 

20.  Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, he repaid me;

21. For I had kept the ways of Yahweh, and not broken away from my God;

22. For, all his regulations, were before me, and, his statutes, did I not put from me:

23. So became I blameless with him, and kept myself from mine iniquity.

24. Yahweh therefore repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the pureness of my hands, before his eyes.

25. With the loving, thou didst show thyself loving,—With the blameless man, thou didst show thyself blameless;

26. With the pure, thou didst show thyself pure, But, with the perverse, thou didst show thyself ready to contend.

27. For, as for thee, an oppressed people, thou didst save, but, looks that were lofty, layedst thou low;

28. For, thou, didst light up my lamp, Yahweh my God, enlightened my darkness; 

29.  For, by thee, I ran through a troop, and, by my God, I leapt over a wall.

30. As for GOD, blameless is his way, The speech of Yahweh hath been proved, A shield, he is to all who seek refuge in him.

31. For who is a GOD, save Yahweh? And who is a Rock, save our God?

32. The GOD who girded me with strength, and set forth, as blameless, my way:

33. Planting my feet like hinds’ [feet], yea, on my high places, he caused me to stand:

34. Teaching my hands to war,—so that a bow of bronze was bent by mine arms.

35. Thus didst thou grant me, as a shield, thy salvation,—and, thy right hand, sustained me, and, thy condescension, made me great.

36. Thou didst widen my stepping-places under me, so that, mine ankles, faltered not.

37. I pursued my foes, and overtook them, and returned not, till they were consumed:

38. I crushed them, and they were unable to rise, They fell under my feet.

39. Thus didst thou gird me with strength, for the battle, Thou subduedst mine assailants under me.

40. As for my foes, thou didst give me their neck, and, as for them who hated me, I destroyed them.

41. They cried out, but there was none to save, unto Yahweh, but he answered them not.

42. Then did I beat them in pieces, like dust on the face of the wind. Like the mire in the lanes, did I scatter them.

43. Thus didst thou rescue me from the contentions of a people,—didst appoint me to be the head of nations, A people I had not known, served me:

44. At the hearing of the ear, they submitted to me, the sons of the foreigner, came cringing unto me:

45. The sons of the foreigner, lost heart, and came quaking out of their fortresses.

46. Yahweh liveth and, blessed, be my Rock, yea, exalted, be the God of my salvation:

47. The GOD, who hath avenged me,—and subjugated peoples under me:

48. Who hath delivered me from my foes,—Yea, from mine assailants, hast thou set me on high, From the man of violence, hast thou rescued me.

49. For this cause, will I praise thee among the nations, O Yahweh, and, to thy Name, will I sweep the strings:—

50. Who hath made great the victories of his King,—and shown lovingkindness to his Anointed One, To David and to his Seed, Unto times age-abiding.  

## Psalms 19

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. The heavens, are telling the glory of GOD, And, the work of his hands, the expanse is declaring;

2. Day, unto day, doth pour forth speech, and, night, unto night, doth breathe out knowledge.

3. There is no speech, and there are no words,—Unheard is their voice!

4. [Yet] through all the earth, hath gone forth their voice,—and, to the end of the world, their sayings,—For the sun, hath he set up a tent therein;

5. And, he, is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, he rejoiceth as a hero to run a race:

6. From one end of the heavens, is his going forth, and, his circuit, to the other end thereof—and, nothing, is hid from his glowing heat. 

7.  The, law of Yahweh, is complete, Bringing back the soul, The, testimony of Yahweh, is confirmed, Making wise the simple;

8. The precepts of Yahweh, are right, Rejoicing the heart, The, commandment of Yahweh, is pure, Enlightening the eyes;

9. The, reverence of Yahweh, is clean, Enduring evermore,—The, decisions of Yahweh, are faithful, They are righteous, altogether:

10. More desirable, than gold, yea than much fine gold, Sweeter, also than honey, or than droppings from the comb.

11. Even thine own servant, taketh warning by them, In the keeping of them, great is the reward.

12. Mistakes, who perceiveth? From things that are hidden, acquit me:

13. Even from the presumptuous, keep back thy servant, May they not have dominion over me, Then, shall I be blameless, and shall be acquitted from great transgression:

14. The words of my mouth, and the soft utterance of my heart, shall come with acceptance, before thee, O Yahweh, my Rock and my Redeemer!  

## Psalms 20

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. Yahweh answer thee, in the day of distress, The Name of the God of Jacob give thee safety;

2. Send thy help out of the sanctuary, and, out of Zion, sustain thee;

3. Remember every present of thine, and, thine ascending-sacrifice, esteem. [Selah.]

4. Give thee according to thy heart, and, all thy purposes, fulfil.

5. We will shout aloud in thy salvation, and, in the Name of our God, shall we become great, Yahweh fulfil all thy petitions. 

6.  Now, do I know that Yahweh, hath saved, his Anointed One,—He answereth him out of his holy heavens, by the mighty saving deeds of his own right hand.

7. These, by chariots, and, those, by horses, but, we, by the Name of Yahweh our God, will prevail.

8. They, have bowed down and fallen, but, we, have arisen, and stand upright.

9. Yahweh, hath saved the king. Answer us, then, on the day when we call.  

## Psalms 21

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. O Yahweh, in thy strength, will the king rejoice, and, in thy salvation, how greatly will he exult!

2. The longing of his heart, hast thou given him, and, the request of his lips, hast thou not withheld. [Selah.]

3. For thou wilt come to meet him, with the blessings of goodness, Thou wilt set on his head, a crown of pure gold.

4. Life, he asked of thee, Thou hast given it him, length of days, to times age-abiding and beyond.

5. Great is his glory, in thy salvation, Honour and majesty, wilt thou lay upon him;

6. For thou wilt appoint him blessings evermore, wilt cheer him with joy by thy countenance; 

7.  For, the king, is trusting in Yahweh, and, in the lovingkindness of the Highest, shall he not be shaken.

8. Thy hand, will find out, all thy foes, Thine own right hand, will find out them who hate thee.

9. Thou wilt make them like a furnace of fire, at the time of thy presence,—Yahweh, in his anger, will swallow them up, and there shall consume them a fire:

10. Their fruit—out of the earth, wilt thou destroy, and their seed, from among the sons of men;

11. For they have held out, against thee, a wicked thing, They have devised a scheme they cannot accomplish.

12. For thou wilt cause them to turn their back, Upon thy bow-strings, wilt thou make ready against their face.

13. Be exalted, O Yahweh, in thy strength! With song and with string will we sound forth thy power.  

## Psalms 22

1. To the Chief Musician. On "the Hind of the Dawn." A Melody of David. My GOD, my GOD, why hast thou forsaken me? Far from saving me, The words of my loud lamentation?

2. My God! I keep crying—By day, and thou dost not answer, and, By night, and there is no rest for me.

3. But, thou, art holy, Who inhabitest the praises of Israel.

4. In thee, trusted our fathers, They trusted, and thou didst deliver them;

5. Unto thee, made they outcry, and escaped, In thee, they trusted, and had not turned pale.

6. But, I, am a worm and no one, a reproach of men, and despised of a people;

7. All that see me, laugh at me,—They open wide the mouth, They shake the head:—

8. He should trust in Yahweh—let him deliver him,—Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.

9. For, thou, art he that severed me from the womb, he that caused me to trust, upon the breasts of my mother;

10. Upon thee, was I cast from the time I was born, From the womb of my mother, my GOD, hast thou been. 

11.  Be not far from me, for, distress, is near, For there is none to help.

12. Many bulls have surrounded me, Strong oxen of Bashan, have enclosed me;

13. They have opened wide against me their mouth, A lion rending and roaring.

14. Like water, am I poured out, and, put out of joint, are all my bones,—My heart, hath become, like wax, it is melted in the midst of my body;

15. Dried as a potsherd, is my strength, And, my tongue, is made to cleave to my gums, And, in the dust of death, wilt thou lay me.

16. For dogs have surrounded me,—An assembly of evil doers, have encircled me, They have pierced my hands and my feet,

17. I may tell all my bones, They, look for—they behold me!

18. They part my garments among them, and, for my vestment, they cast lots.

19. But, thou, O Yahweh, be not far off, O my help! to aid me, make haste;

20. Rescue, from the sword, my life, from the power of the dog, my solitary self:

21. Save me from the mouth of the lion,—Yea, from the horns of wild beasts, hast thou delivered me. 

22.  I will declare thy Name unto my brethren,—In the midst of the convocation, will I praise thee.

23. Ye that revere Yahweh, praise him, All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him, And, stand in awe of him, all ye seed of Israel.

24. For he hath not despised nor abhorred the humbling of the patient one, neither hath he hid his face from him, but, when he cried for help unto him, he heard.

25. Of thee, is my praise in the great convocation, My vows, will I pay, before them who revere him.

26. The patient wronged-ones shall eat and be satisfied, They shall praise Yahweh, who are seekers of him, Let your heart live for aye.

27. All the ends of the earth, will remember and turn to Yahweh, Yea all the families of the nations, will bow themselves down before thee,

28. For, to Yahweh, belongeth the kingdom, And One to Rule over the nations.

29. All the great ones of the earth, shall eat and bow down, Before him shall kneel, all that go down to the dust, Even he who had not kept alive, his own soul!

30. My seed, shall serve him, It shall be recounted, of the Lord, to a generation that shall come:

31. That his righteousness may be declared to a people to be born, That he wrought with effect!  

## Psalms 23

1. A Melody of David. Yahweh, is my shepherd—I shall not want:

2. In pastures of tender grass, he maketh me lie down, Unto restful waters, he leadeth me;

3. My life, he restoreth, He guideth me in right paths, for the sake of his Name.

4. Yea, though I walk through a valley death-shadowed, I will fear no harm, for, thou, art with me, Thy rod and thy staff, they, comfort me.

5. Thou spreadest before me a table, in face of mine adversaries, Thou hast anointed, with oil, my head, My cup, hath run over.

6. Surely, goodness and lovingkindness, will pursue me, all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of Yahweh, evermore.  

## Psalms 24

1. David’s. A Melody. To Yahweh, belongeth, The earth and the fulness thereof, The world, and they who dwell therein;

2. For, he, upon the seas, hath founded it, and upon the currents, doth make it firm. 

3.  Who shall ascend the mountain of Yahweh? And who shall stand in his holy place?

4. The clean of hands, and pure of heart,—who hath not uplifted, to falsehood, his soul, nor sworn deceitfully,

5. Shall bear away a blessing from Yahweh, and righteousness, from his delivering God.

6. This, is the generation of them who inquire of him, who seek thy face, O God of Jacob. [Selah.] 

7.  Lift up, O ye gates, your heads, and lift yourselves up, ye age-abiding doors, That the king of glory may come in.

8. Who is the king of glory? Yahweh, strong and mighty, Yahweh, mighty in war.

9. Lift up, O ye gates, your heads, yea lift [them] up, ye age-abiding doors, That the king of glory may come in.

10. Who then is the king of glory? Yahweh of hosts, He, is the king of glory. [Selah.]  

## Psalms 25

1. David’s. [An Alphabetical Psalm.]  Unto thee, O Yahweh, my soul, would I lift:

2. O my God, in thee, have I put my trust, Let me not be put to shame, Let not my foe exult over me:

3. Yea let, none who wait for thee, be put to shame, Let them be put to shame who act covertly without cause!

4. Thy ways, O Yahweh, let me know, Thy paths, teach thou me:

5. Guide me into thy truth and teach me, for, thou, art my delivering God, For thee, have I waited all the day:

6. Remember thy compassions, O Yahweh, and thy lovingkindnesses, For, from age-past times, have they been.

7. The sins of my youth, and my transgressions, do not thou call to mind,—According to thine own lovingkindness, remember thou me, for the sake of thine own goodness, O Yahweh. 

8.  Good and upright, is Yahweh, For this cause, will he direct sinners into the way.

9. May he guide patient wronged-ones to be righted, and teach such oppressed-ones his way.

10. All the paths of Yahweh, are lovingkindness and faithfulness, to such as keep his covenant, and his testimonies.

11. For the sake of thy Name, O Yahweh, Therefore wilt thou pardon mine iniquity, for great it is.

12. Who then is the man that revereth Yahweh? Let him direct him into the way he should choose.

13. His soul, with prosperity, shall tarry, and, his seed, shall possess the land.

14. Intimacy with Yahweh, have they who revere him, His covenant also, he letteth them know. 

15.  Mine eyes, are continually unto Yahweh,—for, he, bringeth, out of the net, my feet.

16. Turn thou unto me, and show me favour, for, alone and oppressed, I am.

17. The distresses of my heart, hath he relieved,—and, out of my straits, brought me forth.

18. Behold my humiliation and my pain, and take away all my sins.

19. Behold my foes, for they abound,—and, with the hatred of violence, do they hate me.

20. Oh keep my soul, and rescue me, Let me not be put to shame, for I have sought refuge in thee.

21. Let, blamelessness and uprightness, watch over me, because I have waited for thee.

22. Redeem Israel, O God,—out of all his distresses.  

## Psalms 26

1. David’s. Do me justice, O Yahweh, For, I, in my blamelessness, have walked, and, in Yahweh, have I trusted, I will not waver.

2. Try me, O Yahweh, and prove me, Test my reins and my heart:—

3. For, thy lovingkindness, hath been before mine eyes, and I have walked to and fro in thy faithfulness;

4. I have not sat with men of deceit, nor, with dissemblers, would I enter;

5. I have hated the convocation of evil-doers, and, with lawless men, would I not sit; 

6.  I will bathe, in pureness, my hands,—so will I go in procession around thine altar, O Yahweh;

7. To sound aloud a song, and to recount all thy wonderful doings.

8. O Yahweh, I have loved the asylum of thy house, even the place of the habitation of thy glory!

9. Do not remove, with sinners, my soul, nor, with men of bloodshed, my life;

10. In whose hands is a plot, and, their right hand, is filled with a bribe.

11. But, I, in my blamelessness, will walk, Redeem me and show me favour.

12. My foot standeth in a level place, In the convocations, will I bless Yahweh.  

## Psalms 27

1. David’s. Yahweh, is my light and my salvation, Of whom shall I be afraid? Yahweh, is the refuge of my life, Of whom shall I be in dread?

2. When there drew near against me evil-doers to devour my flesh, mine adversaries, and mine enemies—mine!—they, stumbled and fell!

3. Though there pitch against me—a camp, my heart shall not fear,—Though there come up against me—a battle, still, am I confident.

4. One thing, have I asked of Yahweh, That, will I seek to secure,—That I may dwell in the house of Yahweh, all the days of my life, To view the delightfulness of Yahweh, And to contemplate in his temple.

5. For he will hide me in his pavilion, in the day of calamity,—He will conceal me, in the secrecy of his tent, Within a rock, will he set me on high.

6. Now, therefore, shall my head be raised high above my foes round about me, and I will sacrifice in his tent the sacrifices of triumphant joy, I will sing and touch the strings, to Yahweh. 

7.  Hear, O Yahweh, With my voice, do I cry, Oh then show me favour and answer me.

8. To thee, said my heart—[When thou saidst] Seek ye my face—Thy face, O Yahweh, will I seek!

9. Do not hide thy face from me, Do not repulse, in thine anger, thine own servant,—My help, thou hast been, Do not send me away nor forsake me, O my saving God!

10. When, my own father and mother, had forsaken me, Then, Yahweh, took me up!

11. Point out to me, O Yahweh, thy way,—And guide me in a level path, because of mine adversaries.

12. Do not give me up unto the desire of mine adversaries, for there have risen up against me witnesses that are false, and he that fanneth up violence.

13. I believe that I shall see—The goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living,

14. Wait thou for Yahweh,—Be strong, and let thy heart be bold, Wait, then, for Yahweh!  

## Psalms 28

1. David’s. Unto thee, O Yahweh, do I cry, O my Rock! do not turn in silence from me,—lest, if thou turn from me in silence, I be like them who go down into the pit.

2. Hear the voice of my supplication, when I cry to thee for help, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy shrine.

3. Do not drag me away—with the lawless, or with the workers of iniquity,—who speak peaceably with their neighbours, but, wrong, is in their heart.

4. Give them, according to their deed, and, according to the wrong of their practices,—According to the work of their own hands, give thou unto them, Bring back their own dealing to themselves.

5. Because they heed not The Deeds of Yahweh, or the Work of his hands, he will pull them down, and not build them. 

6.  Blessed be Yahweh, Because he hath heard the voice of my supplication.

7. Yahweh, is my strength and my shield, In him, hath trusted my heart, and I have found help,—Therefore hath my heart danced for joy, and, with my song, do I praise him.

8. Yahweh, is strength to his people,—And, the all-saving refuge of his Anointed One, is he!

9. Oh save thy people, and bless thine inheritance, Tend them also, and carry them, Unto times age-abiding.  

## Psalms 29

1. A Melody of David. Give to Yahweh, ye sons of the mighty,—Give to Yahweh, [both] glory and strength:

2. Give to Yahweh, the glory of his Name, Bow down to Yahweh, in the adornment of holiness.

3. The voice of Yahweh, is upon the waters,—The GOD of glory, hath thundered, Yahweh, is upon mighty waters;

4. The voice of Yahweh, is with power, The voice of Yahweh, is with majesty;

5. The voice of Yahweh, is breaking cedars, Now hath Yahweh, broken down, the cedars of Lebanon!

6. And hath made them leap like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion, like the bull-calf of wild-oxen;

7. The voice of Yahweh, is cleaving out flames of fire;

8. The voice of Yahweh, bringeth birth-pains upon the wilderness; Yahweh bringeth birth-pains upon the wilderness of Kadesh!

9. The voice of Yahweh, causeth the gazelles to bring forth, and hath stript forests; and, in his own temple, every one there, is saying, Glory!

10. Yahweh, at the Flood, was seated, And Yahweh hath taken his seat, as king, unto times age-abiding.

11. Yahweh, will give, strength to his people,—Yahweh, will bless his people with prosperity.  

## Psalms 30

1. A Melody. A Song for the Dedication of the House. David’s. I will extol thee, O Yahweh, for thou hast drawn me up,—and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.

2. O Yahweh, my God, I cried for help unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

3. O Yahweh! thou hast lifted, out of hades, my soul, Thou hast brought me back to life, from among those who were going down to the pit.

4. Sweep the strings to Yahweh, ye his men of lovingkindness, and give ye praise at the mention of his holiness.

5. For there is, a Moment, in his anger, a Life-time, in his good-pleasure, In the evening, cometh Weeping to lodge, But, by the morning, ’tis a Shout of Triumph! 

6.  But, I, said, in my tranquility, I shall not be shaken to times age-abiding!

7. O Yahweh, in thy good-pleasure, hadst thou caused my mountain to stand, strong,—Thou didst hide thy face—I was dismayed!

8. Unto thee, O Yahweh, do I cry,—and, unto My Lord, do I make supplication:

9. What profit in my blood? in my going down into the pit? Can dust praise thee? Can it declare thy faithfulness?

10. Hear, O Yahweh, and show me favour, O Yahweh! become thou a helper unto me.

11. Thou hast turned my lamentation, into a dance for me,—Thou hast torn off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness:

12. To the end that mine honour should make melody unto thee, and not be silent. O Yahweh, my God! Unto times age-abiding, will I praise thee.  

## Psalms 31

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. In thee, O Yahweh, have I sought refuge, Let me not be ashamed to times age-abiding, In thy righteousness, deliver me:

2. Incline unto me, thine ear, Speedily rescue me,—Become to me a Rock of refuge, a Place of security, For saving me.

3. Because, my mountain crag and my stronghold, thou art, Therefore, for the sake of thine own Name, wilt thou lead me and guide me?

4. Wilt thou bring me forth, out of the net which they have hidden for me? For, thou, art my refuge.

5. Into thy hand, do I commit my spirit—Thou hast ransomed me, O Yahweh, GOD most faithful.

6. I hate such as give heed to false vanities, I, then, in Yahweh, have set my hope.

7. I will indeed exult and rejoice, in thy lovingkindness,—In that thou hast looked upon my humiliation, thou hast taken note that in distresses was my life;

8. And hast not shut me up in the hand of the foe, Thou hast given standing, in a roomy place, unto my feet. 

9.  Show me favour, O Yahweh, for in distress am I,—Wasted with vexation, is mine eye—my soul and my body;

10. For, consumed with sorrow, is my life, and my years with sighing,—My strength hath staggered with my humiliation, and, my bones, are without marrow.

11. By reason of all mine adversaries, have I become a reproach. Even to my neighbours, altogether, and a dread to mine acquaintance,—They who have seen me abroad, have fled from me:

12. I have been forgotten, like one dead—out of mind, I have been as a missing vessel.

13. For I have heard the whispering of many—A terror round about! When they have sat in conclave together against me, to take away my life, have they intrigued.

14. I, therefore. in thee, have put my trust, O Yahweh, I have said, My God, thou art!

15. In thy hand, are my times, Rescue me from the hand of my foes and from my pursuers!

16. Cause thy face to shine upon thy servant, Save me in thy lovingkindness.

17. O Yahweh! let me not be ashamed, For I have called upon thee, Let the lawless be ashamed, Go down in silence to hades!

18. Let false lips be made dumb,—which are speaking—against a righteous one—arrogantly, with pride and contempt. 

19.  How great is thy goodness, which thou hast hidden away for them who revere thee,—Thou hast wrought for them who seek refuge in thee, in sight of the sons of men.

20. Thou wilt conceal them, in the secrecy of thine own presence, from the conspiracies of men,—Thou wilt hide them in a pavilion, from the strife of tongues.

21. Blessed be Yahweh, for he hath made wonderful his lovingkindness for me, in a fortified city.

22. But, I, had said in mine alarm, I am cut off from before thine eyes,—But, indeed, thou didst hear the voice of my supplication, when I cried for help unto thee.

23. Love Yahweh, all ye his men of lovingkindness,—Faithfulness, doth Yahweh observe, but repayeth abundantly him that worketh proudly.

24. Be strong, and let your heart be bold, all ye who are waiting for Yahweh.  

## Psalms 32

1. David’s An Instructive Psalm. How happy is he whose transgression is forgiven! whose sin is pardoned!

2. How happy the son of earth, to whom Yahweh will not reckon iniquity! and in whose spirit is no guile!

3. When I kept silence, my bones became worn out, Through my groaning all the day;

4. For, day and night, heavy upon me, was thy hand,—Changed was my life-sap into the drought of summer. [Selah.]

5. My sin, would I own unto thee, and, mine iniquity, not hide, I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Yahweh, And, thou, didst forgive the iniquity of my sin. [Selah.]

6. For this cause, will every man of lovingkindness pray unto thee, in time to obtain,—Surely, in the overflow of many waters, unto him, shall they not reach. 

7.  Thou, art a hiding-place for me, From distress, wilt thou preserve me,—With shouts of deliverance, wilt thou compass me about. [Selah.]

8. I will make thee discreet, I will point out to thee the way which thou must go, I will fix upon thee mine eye.

9. Do not ye become like a horse, like a mule, without discernment,—With the bit and bridle of his mouth, [hast thou] to restrain him,—He will not come near unto thee.

10. Many pains, hath the lawless one,—But, he that trusteth in Yahweh, Lovingkindness, shall compass him about.

11. Rejoice in Yahweh and exult, O ye righteous, Yea, shout in triumph, all ye upright in heart!  

## Psalms 33

1. Shout for joy, ye righteous, in Yahweh, To the upright, seemly is praise.

2. Give ye thanks unto Yahweh with the lyre, With a harp of ten strings, make ye music unto him.

3. Sing unto him, a song that is new, With skill, sweep the strings, with loud noise.

4. For right is the word of Yahweh, and, all his work, is in faithfulness:

5. Who loveth righteousness and justice, With the lovingkindness of Yahweh, the earth is full.

6. By the word of Yahweh, the heavens were made, and, by the spirit of his mouth, all their host:

7. Who gathered as into a skin-bottle the waters of the sea, Delivering, into treasuries, the roaring deeps.

8. Let all the earth, stand in awe of Yahweh, Of him, be in dread, all ye inhabitants of the world;

9. For, he, spake, and it was, He, commanded, and it stood forth.

10. Yahweh, hath frustrated the counsel of nations, hath brought to nothing the devices of peoples.

11. The counsel of Yahweh, to times age-abiding, shall stand, The devices of his heart, from generation to generation. 

12.  How happy the nation whose God is, Yahweh, The people he hath chosen as his own inheritance!

13. Out of the heavens, hath Yahweh looked, He hath seen all the sons of men:

14. Out of his settled place of abode, hath he fixed his gaze on all the inhabitants of the earth:

15. Who fashioneth their heart all together, Who understandeth all their doings.

16. Not a king, can be saved by greatness of force, nor, hero, deliver himself by greatness of strength:

17. A deception, is the horse, for victory, and, by his great strength, shall he not deliver.

18. Lo! the eye of Yahweh, is toward them who revere him, unto such as are waiting for his lovingkindness:

19. To rescue, from death, their soul, and to keep them alive in famine.

20. Our own soul, hath waited for Yahweh, Our help and our shield, is he!

21. For, in him, shall our heart rejoice, For, in his holy Name, have we trusted.

22. Be thy lovingkindness, O Yahweh, upon us, According as we have waited for thee.  

## Psalms 34

1. David’s. When he disguised his sanity before Abimelech,—who dismissed him, and he departed. [An Alphabetical Psalm.]  Let me bless Yahweh at all times, Continually be his praise in my mouth.

2. In Yahweh, boasteth my soul, The patient oppressed-ones shall hear and be glad.

3. Ascribe ye greatness unto Yahweh with me, and let us exalt his Name together.

4. I enquired of Yahweh, and he hath answered me, And, out of all my terrors, hath he rescued me.

5. They looked unto him and were radiant, And, as for their faces, let them not be abashed.

6. This, oppressed one cried, and, Yahweh, heard—and, out of all his distresses, saved him.

7. The messenger of Yahweh encampeth around them who revere him, Thus hath he delivered them.

8. Oh taste and see, that good is Yahweh,—How happy the man who seeketh refuge in him!

9. Revere Yahweh, ye his holy ones, For there is no want to them who revere him.

10. Young lions, have come short, and suffered hunger, but, they who seek Yahweh, shall not lack any good thing. 

11.  Come, ye children! hearken unto me, The reverence of Yahweh, will I teach you.

12. Who is the man that desireth life, Loving days, that he may see good?

13. Keep thy tongue from wickedness, And thy lips from speaking deceit:

14. Depart from wickedness and do good, Aim at well-being, and pursue it.

15. The eyes of Yahweh, are towards the righteous, And, his ears, towards their cry for help:

16. the face of Yahweh, is against such as do wickedness, To cut off, from the earth, their memory.

17. They made outcry, and Yahweh heard, And, out of all their straits, hath he rescued them.

18. Near is Yahweh, to the broken in heart, And, the crushed in spirit, will he save.

19. Many are the misfortunes of the righteous, But, out of them all, doth Yahweh rescue him.

20. Keeping all his bones, Not, one from among them, is broken.

21. Misfortune shall be the death of the lawless one, And, the haters of the righteous man, shall be held guilty.

22. Yahweh ransometh the soul of his servants, And none shall be held guilty, who seek refuge in him.  

## Psalms 35

1. David’s. Contend, O Yahweh, with them who contend with me, Make war upon them who make war upon me.

2. Grasp buckler and shield, and arise in my help;

3. Then draw the spear, and close up against my pursuers, Say to my soul, Thy salvation, I am!

4. Let them be ashamed and confounded, who are seeking my life,—Let them turn back and be put to the blush, who are devising my hurt:

5. Let them be as chaff before the wind, with, the messenger of Yahweh, pressing them on:

6. Let their way become dark and slippery, with, the messenger of Yahweh, pursuing them.

7. For, without cause, have they hid for me, in a ditch, their net,—Without cause, have they digged [a pit] for my life.

8. There shall reach him a ruin he could not know,—Yea, his own net which he hath hidden, shall capture him, Into that ruin, shall he fall!

9. But, my soul, shall exult in Yahweh,—shall be glad in his salvation.

10. All my bones, shall say—O Yahweh, who is like unto thee? Rescuing the oppressed from one stronger than he, Yea the oppressed and the needy, from their spoiler. 

11.  There rise up witnesses helping forward violence and wrong, What I know not, they demand of me:

12. They repay me evil for good, Bereaving my soul.

13. But, as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I humbled, with fasting, my soul, though, my prayer, unto mine own bosom, might return:

14. Like as for a friend, like as for a brother of mine own, I walked to and fro, As though mourning for a mother, I gloomily bowed myself down.

15. But, in mine overthrow, have they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together,—There gathered themselves together against me foolish men, and I knew it not, They have torn in pieces, and not been silent;

16. Amidst profane praters of perversion, have they gnashed upon me with their teeth. 

17.  My Lord! how long wilt thou look on? Bring back my soul out of their raging, from among lions, my solitary self.

18. I will thank thee, in the midst of a great convocation,—In the midst of a mighty people, will I praise thee.

19. Let not them who are falsely my foes rejoice over me, As for them who hate me without cause, let them not wink the eye!

20. For, no salvation, will they utter,—But, against the quiet of the land, deceitful things, do they devise;

21. Yea they have opened wide against me their mouth, They have said, Aha! Aha! our own eye, hath seen!

22. Thou hast seen, O Yahweh, do not keep silence! O My Lord! be not far from me:

23. Bestir thyself and wake up, to my vindication, O my God and My Lord!—to my plea:

24. Vindicate me according to thy righteousness, O Yahweh, my God! And let them not rejoice over me:

25. Let them not say in their heart, Aha! to our mind! Let them not say, We have swallowed him up!

26. Let them turn pale, and then at once blush, who are rejoicing at my misfortune,—Let them be clothed with shame and confusion, who are magnifying themselves against me.

27. Let them shout in triumph and rejoice, who are desiring my justification; And let them say continually, Yahweh be magnified, Who hath taken pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

28. Mine own tongue also, shall softly utter thy righteousness,—All the day long,—thy praise!  

## Psalms 36

1. To the Chief Musician. Of the Servant of Yahweh—of David. Declareth the transgression of the lawless one, within my heart, There is, no dread of God, before his eyes;

2. For he flattereth himself [too much] in his own eyes, to find his iniquity—to hate [it] .

3. The words of his mouth, are iniquity and deceit, he hath left off to show discretion by doing well:

4. Iniquity, deviseth he upon his bed,—he taketh his stand in a way, not good, Wrong, doth he not abhor! 

5.  O Yahweh! in the heavens, is thy lovingkindness, Thy faithfulness, as far as the fleecy clouds:

6. Thy righteousness, is like mighty mountains, and, thy just decrees, are a great resounding deep,—Man and beast, thou savest, O Yahweh!

7. How precious thy lovingkindness, O God,—Therefore, the sons of men, under the shadow of thy wings, seek refuge:

8. They abundantly relish the fatness of thy house,—And out of the full stream of thine own pleasures, thou givest them to drink.

9. For, with thee, is the fountain of life, In thy light, we see light.

10. Prolong thy lovingkindness unto them who know thee,—and thy righteousness, to the upright in heart.

11. Let not the foot of pride reach me, nor, the hand of the lawless, scare me away.

12. There did the workers of iniquity fall,—thrust down and not able to rise!  

## Psalms 37

1. David’s. [An Alphabetical Psalm.]  Burn not with vexation because of evil-doers, Be not envious of the workers of perversity;

2. For, like grass, soon shall they wither, and, like green herbage, shall they fade.

3. Trust in Yahweh, and do good, Dwell in the land, and feed on fidelity;

4. Yea, rest thy delight on Yahweh, that he may give thee the requests of thy heart.

5. Roll on Yahweh thy way, Trust also in him, and, he, will effectually work:

6. So will he bring forth, as the light, thy righteousness, and thy vindication as the noonday. 

7.  Be resigned to Yahweh, yea wait with longing for him; Burn not with vexation at him who prospereth in his way,—at the man who doeth wickedness.

8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath, Burn not with vexation—[it would be] only to do evil;

9. For, evil doers, shall be cut off, but, as for them who wait for Yahweh, they, shall inherit the earth.

10. Yet a little, therefore, and the lawless one shall not be, Yea thou shalt look about, over his place—and he shall have vanished!

11. But, the patient oppressed-ones, shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves over the abundance of prosperity.

12. Plotting is the lawless one, against the just, and gnashing upon him with his teeth.

13. My Lord, shall laugh at him, for he seeth, that his day, will come.

14. A sword, have the lawless, drawn out, and have trodden their bow,—To bring down the oppressed and the needy, To slaughter the upright in life:

15. Their sword, shall enter into their own heart, and, their bow, shall be broken.

16. Better the little of the righteous man, than the abundance of the lawless who are mighty;

17. For, the arms of the lawless, shall be broken, But Yahweh is upholding the righteous.

18. Yahweh knoweth the days of the blameless, that, their inheritance, unto times age-abiding, shall continue.

19. They shall not be ashamed in the time of calamity, and, in the days of famine, shall they be filled.

20. For, the lawless, shall perish, and, the foes of Yahweh, be like the glory of the meadows, They have vanished! In smoke, have they vanished! 

21.  A lawless man borroweth, and will not repay, But, a righteous man, showeth favour and giveth;

22. For, such as are blessed of him, shall inherit the earth, But, the cursed of him, shall be cut off.

23. From Yahweh, are the steps of a man made firm, When, with his way, he is well pleased:

24. Though he fall, he shall not be hurled headlong, For, Yahweh, is holding his hand.

25. Young, have I been, moreover am old,—Yet have I not seen, A righteous man forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread:

26. All day long, is he showing favour and lending, his seed, therefore, shall have a blessing.

27. Turn from evil, and do good, and so settle down, unto times age-abiding.

28. For, Yahweh, loveth justice, and will not forsake his men of lovingkindness, Unto times age-abiding, have the perverse been destroyed,—and the seed of the lawless, been cut off.

29. The righteous, shall inherit the earth, that they may settle down, to futurity, thereupon.

30. The mouth of a righteous man, softly uttereth wisdom, and, his tongue, speaketh justice:

31. The law of his God, is in his heart, his steps shall not swerve.

32. The lawless man, lieth in wait, for the just, and seeketh to put him to death:

33. Yahweh, will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him, when he is judged. 

34.  Wait for Yahweh, and observe thou his path, that he may exalt thee, to inherit the earth, On the cutting off of the lawless, shalt thou look.

35. I have seen a lawless man, a tyrant, and spreading himself out, like a cedar in Lebanon;

36. Then I passed by, and lo! he had vanished! Yea I sought him, but he could not be found.

37. Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright, for there is a hereafter for the man of peace;

38. But, transgressors, are to be destroyed together, the hereafter of lawless men, is to be cut off.

39. But, the deliverance of the righteous, is from Yahweh, their refuge in a time of distress.

40. Thus hath Yahweh helped them, thus hath he delivered them,—He will deliver them from the lawless, and will save them, because they have sought refuge in him.  

## Psalms 38

1. A Melody of David. To bring to Remembrance. O Yahweh, do not, in thine anger, correct me, nor, in thy wrath, chastise me;

2. For, thine arrows, have sunk down into me, and thy hand, presseth heavily upon me.

3. There is no soundness in my flesh, By reason of thine indignation, There is no peace in my bones, By reason of my sin;

4. For, mine iniquities, have passed over my head, Like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me:

5. My wounds are of bad odour—they have festered, by reason of my folly:

6. I am bent, I am bowed down very low. All the day, have I gloomily walked;

7. For, my loins, are filled with inflammation, and there is no soundness in my flesh:

8. I am benumbed and crushed exceedingly,—I have cried aloud because of the groaning of my heart.

9. O My Lord! before thee, is all my longing, and, my sighing, from thee, hath not been hid:

10. My heart, fluttereth, my strength hath forsaken me, and, as for the light of mine eyes, even they, are not with me:

11. My lovers, and my friends, from before my stroke, stand aloof,—and, my near ones, far away, do stand: 

12.  Yea they who are seeking my life, have laid snares, and they who are asking my harm, have threatened engulfing ruin, And, deceitful things—all day long, do they mutter.

13. But, I, as one deaf, will not hear,—and as one dumb, who will not open his mouth:

14. Thus have I become as a man who cannot hear, in whose mouth are no arguments:

15. Because, for thee, O Yahweh, have I waited, Thou, wilt answer, O Adonay, my God!

16. For I said, Lest they rejoice over me! When my feet were tottering, against me, have they magnified themselves:

17. For, I, to halt, am ready, and, my pain, is before me continually;

18. For, mine iniquity, will I declare, I shall be anxious because of my sin;

19. And, my foes, are alive—have become strong,—and multiplied are they who hate me for false cause:

20. Even they who are repaying evil for good, accuse me because I pursue the good.

21. Do not forsake me, O Yahweh, My God! be not far from me:

22. Make haste to help me, My Lord, my deliverance!  

## Psalms 39

1. To the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun. A Melody of David. I said, [to myself,] I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue,—I will put on my mouth a muzzle, So long as the lawless is before me.

2. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, afar from happiness, But, my pain had been stirred:

3. Hot was my heart within me, While I was musing, there was kindled a fire, I spake with my tongue!

4. Let me know, O Yahweh, mine end, And the measure of my days—what it is, I would know how short-lived I am.

5. Lo! as hand-breadths, hast thou granted my days, and my life-time, is as nothing before thee,—Surely, a mere breath, are all men, [even] such as stand firm. [Selah.]

6. Surely as a shadow, doth every man wander, Surely in vain, do they bustle about, he heapeth things up, and knoweth not who shall gather them in. 

7.  Now, therefore, for what have I waited, O My Lord? My hope, is, in thee.

8. From all my transgressions, rescue thou me,—The reproach of the base, oh do not make me!

9. I am dumb, I cannot open my mouth, for, thou, hast done it.

10. Remove from off me thy stroke, Because of the hostility of thy hand, am, I, consumed.

11. When, by rebukes for iniquity, thou hast corrected a man, Then hast thou consumed, as a moth, all that was delightful within him, Surely, a breath, are all men. [Selah.]

12. Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, And, unto my cry for help, give ear, At my tears, do not be silent,—For, a sojourner, am, I, with thee, A stranger, like all my fathers.

13. Look away from me that I may brighten up, Ere yet I depart and am no more.  

## Psalms 40

1. To the Chief Musician. David’s. A Melody. I waited patiently for Yahweh,—And he inclined, unto me, and heard my cry for help;

2. So he brought me up, Out of the destroying pit, Out of the swampy mire,—And set, upon a cliff, my feet, Making firm my steps:

3. Then put he, into my mouth, a new song, Praise to our God,—Many shall see and revere, And shall trust in Yahweh.

4. How happy the man, Who hath made Yahweh his confidence, who hath not turned unto the haughty, nor gone aside unto falsehood.

5. Mighty things, hast thou done—Thou, Yahweh my God, Thy wonderful doings and thy purposes towards us, There is no setting them in order unto thee—I would tell, and would speak!—They are too great to rehearse. 

6.  Sacrifice and meal-offering, thou didst not delight in, Ears, didst thou pierce for me,—Ascending-sacrifice and sin-bearer, thou didst not ask:

7. Then, said I—Lo! I am come, In the written scroll, is it prescribed for me;

8. To do thy good-pleasure, O my God, is my delight, And, thy law, is in the midst of mine inward parts:

9. I have told the good-tidings of righteousness in a great convocation, Lo! my lips, do I not restrain, O Yahweh, thou, knowest:

10. Thy righteousness, have I not hid in the midst of my heart, Thy faithfulness and thy salvation, have I spoken, I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truthfulness from the great convocation. 

11.  Thou, O Yahweh, wilt not restrain thy compassions from me, Thy lovingkindness and thy truthfulness, shall continually watch over me.

12. For there have closed in upon me, misfortunes beyond number, Mine iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see, They have become more than the hairs of my head, And, my courage, hath forsaken me!

13. Be pleased, O Yahweh, to rescue me, O Yahweh! to help me, make haste!

14. Let them turn pale and then at once blush, who are seeking my life to snatch it away,—Let them draw back, and be confounded, who are taking pleasure in my calamity;

15. Let them be astonished on account of their own shame, who are saying of me, Aha! Aha!

16. Let all them be glad and rejoice in thee, who are seekers of thee. Let them say continually—Yahweh be magnified! who are lovers of thy salvation.

17. But, I, being oppressed and needy, May My Lord devise for me,—My help and my deliverer, thou art! O my God, do not tarry!  

## Psalms 41

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. How happy is he that is attentive to the poor, In the day of calamity, will Yahweh deliver him:

2. Yahweh, will preserve him and keep him alive, And he shall be pronounced happy in the land, Do not then give him up at the desire of his enemies!

3. Yahweh, will sustain him upon the bed of sickness, All his couch, hast thou transformed in his disease.

4. I, said—O Yahweh, show me favour, heal thou my soul, for I have sinned against thee: 

5.  Mine enemies, speak ill of me, When will he die, and his name perish?

6. And, if he have come to see me, Falsehood, doth he speak, His own heart, gathereth iniquity to itself, he goeth forth, abroad he telleth it.

7. Together—against me, do all who hate me whisper among themselves, Against me, devise they hurt for me.

8. An infliction of the Abandoned One hath been fixed upon him, and, now that he hath lien down, he will not again rise.

9. Even the man whom I used to salute, in whom I put confidence, who used to eat my bread,—hath magnified his heel against me!

10. But, thou, O Yahweh, show me favour and raise me up, That I may repay them.

11. Hereby, do I know that thou delightest in me, In that mine enemy shall not raise a shout over me.

12. But, as for me, In my blamelessness, hast thou held me fast, And hast caused me to stand before thee unto times age-abiding.

13. Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, From the age that is past, even unto the age yet to come: Amen and Amen!  

## Psalms 42

1. To the Chief Musician. An Instructive Psalm for the Sons of Korah. As, the hart, cometh panting up to the channels of water, So my soul, panteth for thee, O God.

2. My soul thirsteth for God, for a GOD who liveth,—When shall I enter in, and see the face of God?

3. My tears have been my food day and night, While it hath been said unto me all the day, Where is thy God?

4. These things, I keep calling to mind, and pouring out, over me, my own soul, For I used to cross over with a crowd, Lead them in procession up to the house of God, With the voice of shouting and praise.—a throng keeping festival.

5. Why shouldst thou be cast down, O my soul? And [why] shouldst thou moan over me? Wait thou for God, for yet shall I praise him, As the triumph of my presence. 

6.  My God! over myself, my soul is cast down,—For this cause, will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.

7. Roaring deep unto roaring deep, is calling, at the voice of thy cataracts, All thy breakers and thy rolling waves, over me, have passed.

8. By day, will Yahweh command his lovingkindness, And, in the night, shall His song be with me, My prayer be to the GOD of my life.

9. I will say onto GOD,—my rock, Wherefore hast thou forgotten me? Wherefore in gloom should I go, because of oppression by the enemy?

10. With a crushing of my bones, have my adversaries reproached me,—While they keep saying unto me all the day, Where is thy God?

11. Why shouldst thou be sat down, O my soul? And why shouldst thou moan over me? Wait thou for God, for yet shall I praise him, As the triumph of my presence and my God.  

## Psalms 43

1. Vindicate me, O God, and plead my cause, Against a nation, without lovingkindness, From the man of deceit and perversity, wilt thou deliver me?

2. For, thou, art my defending God—Wherefore hast thou rejected me? Wherefore in gloom should I wander, because of the oppression of an enemy?

3. Send forth thy light and thy faithfulness, Let, them, lead me, Let them bring me into thy holy mountain, and into thy habitations:

4. That I may go in unto the altar of God, Unto GOD, mine exultant joy,—That I may praise thee with the lyre, O God—mine own God!

5. Why shouldst thou be cast down, O my soul? And why shouldst thou moan over me, Wait thou for God, for yet shall I praise him, As the triumph of my presence, and my God.  

## Psalms 44

1. To the Chief Musician. For the Sons of Korah. An Instructive Psalm. O God! with our own ears, have we heard, Our fathers, have recounted to us,—The work thou didst work, In their day, In the days of aforetime:

2. Thou thyself, with thine own hand—Didst dispossess, nations, and didst plant them, Didst break peoples in pieces, and didst spread them out:

3. For, not by their own sword, gat they possession of the land, Nor did, their own arm, win victory for them,—But thine own right hand, and thine own arm, and the light of thy face, Because thou hadst accepted them.

4. Thou thyself, art my king, O God, Command thou the victories of Jacob.

5. By thee, will we thrust at, our adversaries, In thy Name, will we tread down our assailants;

6. For, not in my bow, will I trust, Nor shall, my sword, give me victory;

7. For thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And, them who hated us, hast thou put to shame.

8. In God, have we boasted all the day, And, thy Name—unto times age-abiding, will we praise. [Selah.] 

9.  But nay thou hast rejected, and confounded us, And wilt not go forth with our hosts;

10. Thou sufferest us to turn back from the adversary, And, they who hate us, have plundered at will:

11. Thou dost give us up like sheep to be devoured, And, amongst the nations, hast thou scattered us.

12. Thou dost sell thy people for, no-value, And hast not made increase by their price.

13. Thou dost make us, A reproach to our neighbours, A mockery and a derision to them who are round about us:

14. Thou dost make us, A by-word among the nations,—A shaking of the head among the peoples.

15. All the day, is my confusion before me, And, the shame of my face, hath covered me:

16. At the voice of him who reproacheth and revileth, At the face of the foe and avenger. 

17.  All this, hath come upon us, Yet had we not forgotten thee, Neither had we dealt falsely with thy covenant;

18. Our heart had not drawn back, Nor had our goings swerved from thy path;

19. That thou shouldst have crushed us down in the place of wild dogs, And covered us over with a deadly shadow.

20. If we had forgotten the Name of our God, And had spread forth our hands unto the GOD of the foreigner,

21. Would not, God, have searched into this, Seeing that, he, knoweth the secrets of the heart?

22. Surely, for thy sake, have we been slain all the day, We have been accounted as sheep for slaughter.

23. Awake thou! wherefore shouldst thou sleep, O Lord? Bestir thee! do not reject us altogether!

24. Wherefore shouldst thou hide, thy face? Shouldst forget our humiliation and our oppression?

25. For our soul, sinketh down to the dust, Our body, cleaveth to the earth.

26. Arise to our help, And ransom us, because of thine own lovingkindness.  

## Psalms 45

1. To the Chief Musician. On Shoshannim. For the Sons of Korah. A Psalm of Instruction. A Song of Love. Overflowed hath my heart, with an excellent theme, I will recite my poem concerning the king, Be, my tongue, [like] the pen of a scribe who is skilled.

2. Most beautiful thou art, beyond the sons of men, Graciousness hath been poured forth by thy lips, For this cause, hath God blessed thee, to times age-abiding.

3. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, [’Tis] thine honour and thy majesty;

4. And, [in] thy majesty, be successful! ride forth! on behalf of faithfulness, and humility—righteousness, And let thine own right hand show thee wonderful things.

5. Thine arrows, are sharp—Peoples, under thee, fall! In the heart of the foes of the king. 

6.  Thy throne, O God, is to times age-abiding and beyond, A sceptre of equity, is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

7. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated lawlessness,—For this cause, hath God, thine own God, anointed thee, With the oil of gladness, beyond thy partners.

8. Myrrh and aloes, cassias, all thy garments,—Out of the palaces of ivory, the tones of strings, have rejoiced thee.

9. Daughters of kings, are among thine honourable women, Stationed is the bride at thy right hand, in gold of Ophir. 

10.  Hearken, O daughter, and observe, Incline also thine ear, Forget, then, thine own people, And the house of thy father;

11. When the king shall desire thy beauty, Surely, he, is thy lord, then bow down to him.

12. Also, the daughter of Tyre, [cometh in] with a present! Thy face, shall the rich of the people appease.

13. All glorious—the daughter of a king [sitteth] within, Brocades, wrought with gold, [are] her clothing!

14. In embroidered raiment, shall she be brought unto the king—The virgins that follow her, her companions, are to be conducted unto thee:

15. They shall be brought, with rejoicings and exultation,—They shall enter into the palace of the king!

16. Instead of thy fathers, be thy sons, Thou shalt make them rulers in all the earth.

17. I will keep in remembrance thy Name, through each succeeding generation, For this cause, peoples, shall praise thee, to times age-abiding and beyond.  

## Psalms 46

1. To the Chief Musician. For the Sons of Korah, on Alamoth. A Song. God—for us, is a refuge and strength, A help in distresses, soon found.

2. For this cause, will we not fear, Though the earth showeth change, Or the mountains slip into the heart of the seas:

3. The waters thereof roar and foam, The mountains tremble with the swelling thereof [Selah.]

4. A river! whose channels, shall gladden the city of God, The Most High, hath hallowed his habitation.

5. God, is in the midst of her, she shall not be shaken, God will help her, by the turnings of the morning. 

6.  Nations have roared, Kingdoms have tottered, He hath uttered his voice, Earth melteth.

7. Yahweh of hosts, is with us, A high tower for us, is the God of Jacob. [Selah.]

8. Come! view the doings of Yahweh,—Who hath set desolations in the earth;

9. Causing wars to cease unto the end of the earth,—The bow, he shivereth, And breaketh in pieces the spear, war-chariots, burneth he up with fire.

10. Let be! and know that, I, am God, I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.

11. Yahweh of hosts, is with us, A high tower for us, is the God of Jacob. [Selah.]  

## Psalms 47

1. To the Chief Musician. For the Sons of Korah. A Melody. All ye peoples, clap your hands, Shout unto God, with the voice of triumph;

2. For, Yahweh—as Most High, is to be revered, A great king, over all the earth,

3. He will subjugate, Peoples under us, and, Tribes of men beneath our feet.

4. He chooseth for us our inheritance, The excellence of Jacob, which he hath loved. [Selah.] 

5.  God hath ascended with a shout, Yahweh, with the sound of a horn.

6. Sing praises unto God, sing praises, Sing praises to our King, sing praises;

7. For God is king of all the earth, Sing praises with understanding.

8. God, hath become king, over the nations, God, hath taken his seat upon his holy throne.

9. The willing-hearted of the peoples, have gathered themselves together, The people of the God of Abraham; For, to God, belong the shields of the earth, Greatly is he exalted.  

## Psalms 48

1. A Melodious Song. For the Sons of Korah. Great is Yahweh, and worthy to be mightily praised, In the city of our God, His holy mountain.

2. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of all the land, Is Mount Zion, in the recesses of the north,—The city of a great king.

3. God, in her palaces, is to be known as a high tower.

4. For lo! Kings—Met as appointed, Passed by together;

5. They themselves, saw, So, were they amazed, Dismayed—they hurried way!

6. Trembling, seized them, there, Pangs. like hers who is in travail.

7. With an east wind, wilt thou shatter the ships of Tarshish. 

8.  Just as we have heard, So, have we seen, In the city of Yahweh of hosts, In the city of our God, God himself, will establish her, unto times age-abiding. [Selah.]

9. We have thought, O God, upon thy lovingkindness, In the midst of thy temple:

10. According to thy Name, O God, So, be thy praise, unto the ends of the earth, With righteousness, is, thy right hand, filled.

11. Let Mount Zion rejoice, Let the daughters of Judah exult, Because of thy judgments.

12. Go round Zion, and compass her about, Reckon up her towers;

13. Apply your mind to her rampart, Pass between her palaces, That ye may recount them to an after generation;

14. For, this God, is our God, to times age-abiding and beyond, He himself, will conduct us till death.  

## Psalms 49

1. To the Chief Musician. For the Sons of Korah. A Melody. Hear ye, this all ye peoples, Give ear, all ye inhabitants of this passing world;

2. Both sons of the low, And sons of the high,—Together both rich and needy:—

3. My mouth, shall speak forth Wisdom, And the soft utterance of my heart be Understanding:

4. I will bend, to a by-word, mine ear, I will open, on the lyre, mine enigma.

5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of calamity, Though the iniquity of them who lie in wait for me should enclose me? 

6.  As for them who are trusting in their wealth,—And, in the abundance of their riches, do boast themselves,

7. A brother, can none of them, redeem, he cannot give unto God a ransom for himself:

8. So costly, is the redemption of their soul, That it faileth unto times age-abiding;

9. That he should, yet, live on, continually, Should not see corruption.

10. For it is seen that, the wise, die, Together with the dullard, and the brutish, do they perish, And leave, to others, their wealth:

11. Their, inward thought, is that their houses are for times age-abiding, Their habitations, for generation after generation,—They give their own names unto lands!

12. But, a son of earth, though wealthy, cannot tarry, He hath made himself a by-word—Beasts, they resemble:

13. This, their way, is a folly to them, And yet, their followers, with their mouth, approve. [Selah.]

14. Like sheep—into hades, are they driven, Death shall shepherd them,—And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, Even their form, is to decay, Hades, is all that remaineth of a habitation for him. 

15.  But, God, will redeem my soul, out of the hand of hades, For he will take me. [Selah.]

16. Do not fear, When a man becometh rich, When the glory of his house increaseth;

17. For, when he dieth, he shall take, nothing, his glory shall not descend after him;

18. For, though, his own self—while he lived, he used to bless, And they will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,

19. He shall enter as far as the circle of his fathers, Nevermore, shall they see the light.

20. A son of earth though wealthy, who discerneth not, Hath made himself a by-word, Beasts, they resemble.  

## Psalms 50

1. A Melody of Asaph. El, Elohim, Yahweh, hath spoken, and culled the earth, From the rising of the sun, unto the going in thereof:

2. Out of Zion the perfection of beauty, God, hath shone forth.

3. Let our God come, and let him not keep silence! A fire—before him, shall devour, And, around him, hath it become exceeding tempestuous:

4. He calleth, Unto the heavens above, And unto the earth, That he may judge his people.

5. Gather yourselves unto me—ye my men of lovingkindness, Who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.

6. Now have the heavens declared his righteousness, Because, God, is, about to judge. [Selah.] 

7.  Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will adjure thee, God, thine own God, I am:—

8. Not, for thy sacrifices, will I reprove thee, Nor for thine ascending-offerings, before me continually:

9. I will not take out of thy house—a bullock, Nor out of thy folds—he-goats;

10. For, mine, is every wild-beast of the forest, The cattle on the mountains, in their thousands;

11. I know every bird of the mountains, And, the moving things of the plain, are with me:

12. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, For, mine, is the world, and the fulness thereof.

13. Will I eat the flesh of mighty oxen? Or, the blood of he-goats, will I drink?

14. Sacrifice to God a thankoffering, And pay to the Most High thy vows;

15. Call upon me, then, in the day of distress, I will deliver thee, that thou mayest glorify me. 

16.  But, to the lawless one, God saith, What hast, thou, to do, to recount my statutes? Or that thou hast taken up my covenant upon thy mouth?

17. Seeing that, thou, hast hated correction, And hast cast my words behind thee;

18. If thou sawest a thief, then didst thou run with him,—And, with adulterers, hath been thy chosen life;

19. Thy mouth, hast thou thrust into wickedness, And, thy tongue, kept weaving deceit;

20. Thou wouldst sit down—Against thine own brother, wouldst thou speak, Against thine own mother’s son, wouldst thou expose a fault:—

21. These things, hast thou done, and I have kept silence, Thou thoughtest that I should really be like thyself, I will convict thee, yea I will set [thine offences] in order before thine eyes.

22. Understand this, I pray you, ye forgetters of GOD, Lest I tear in pieces, and there be none to deliver:—

23. He that sacrificeth a thankoffering, will glorify me,—And will prepare a way by which I may show him the salvation of God.  

## Psalms 51

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. When Nathan the Prophet had come to him, after he had gone in unto Bath-sheba. Be favorable unto me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness, And, in the multitude of thy compassions, blot out my transgressions;

2. Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity, And, from my sin, make me pure;

3. For, my transgressions, do, I, acknowledge, And, my sin, is before me continually:

4. Against thee—against thee alone, have I sinned, And, wickedness—in thine eyes, have I done,—That thou mayest, Be justified when thou speakest,—Be clear when thou judgest.

5. Lo! in iniquity, was I brought forth, And, in sin, did my mother conceive me.

6. Lo! faithfulness, hast thou desired in the inward parts, Yea, in the hidden part, wilt thou cause me to know, wisdom. 

7.  Wilt thou cleanse me from sin with hyssop, That I may be pure? Wilt thou wash me, That I may be whiter, than snow?

8. Wilt thou cause me to hear joy and gladness? The bones thou hast crushed would exult.

9. Hide thy face from my sins,—And, all mine iniquities, blot out;

10. A pure heart, create for me, O God, And, a steadfast spirit, renew within me.

11. Do not cast me away from thy presence, And, thy Holy Spirit, do not take from me:

12. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, And, with a willing spirit, wilt thou uphold me:—

13. I would teach transgressors thy ways, And, sinners, unto thee, should return. 

14.  Rescue me from shed-blood, O God, the God of my salvation, My tongue should shout thy righteousness;

15. O My Lord! my lips, wilt thou open, And, my mouth, shall declare thy praise.

16. For thou wilt not desire sacrifice—that I should give it, Ascending-offering, will not please:

17. The sacrifices of God, are a spirit that is broken,—A heart—broken and crushed, O God, thou wilt not despise.

18. Do good, in thy good-pleasure, unto Zion, Wilt thou build the walls of Jerusalem!

19. Then, shalt thou desire the sacrifices of righteousness, Ascending-sacrifice and whole burnt-offering, Then, shall ascend upon thine altar, young bulls.  

## Psalms 52

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Instruction, of David. When Doeg the Edomite went, and told Saul; and said to him,—David, hath entered the house of Ahimelech. Why dost thou boast thyself of wickedness, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of GOD, [lasteth] all the day.

2. Engulfing ruin, doth thy tongue devise, Like a whetted razor, working deceit;

3. Thou lovest Evil more than good, Falsehood, more than speaking righteousness. [Selah.]

4. Thou lovest all devouring words, O deceitful tongue!

5. GOD also, will break thee down utterly, He will snatch thee up and tear thee away tentless, And uproot thee, out of the land of the living. [Selah.] 

6.  The righteous shall both see and fear, And, over him, shall laugh:

7. Lo! the man who made not God his refuge,—But trusted in the abundance of his riches, Emboldened himself in his wealth!

8. But, I, am like a flourishing olive-tree, in the house of God, I have put confidence in the lovingkindness of God, for times age-abiding and beyond.

9. I will praise thee to times age-abiding, Because thou didst effectually work,—And I will wait on thy Name, Because it is good, In the presence of thy men of lovingkindness.  

## Psalms 53

1. To the Chief Musician. On Mahalath. A Psalm of Instruction, of David. The impious hath said in his heart, There is no God! They have acted corruptly, They have wrought abominable perversity, There is none that doeth good:—

2. God, out of the heavens, looked down upon the sons of men,—To see whether there was one that showed wisdom, Enquiring after God.

3. They all, have turned back, together have they become tainted,—There is none that doeth good, Not so much as, one!

4. Are the workers of iniquity, without knowledge? Devouring my people, [as] they devour food? Upon God, have they not called.

5. There have they been in great dread where no dread was, Because, God, hath scattered the bones of thy besieger,—Thou hast put [him] to shame, Because, God, had, rejected, them.

6. Oh that, out of Zion, were granted the salvations of Israel! When God bringeth back the captives of his people, Jacob, shall exult, Israel, shall be glad.  

## Psalms 54

1. To the Chief Musician: with Stringed Instruments. A Psalm of Instruction, of David. When the Ziphites came and said unto Saul, Is not, David, hiding himself, with us? O God! by thine own Name, save me, And, by thine own strength, wilt thou vindicate me?

2. O God! Hear my prayer, Give ear to the sayings of my mouth;

3. For, aliens, have risen up against me, And, men of violence, have sought my life, They have not set God before them. [Selah.] 

4.  Lo! God, is bringing me help, My Lord, is with the upholders of my life;

5. Let him turn back the mischief upon mine adversaries, In thy faithfulness, destroy them!

6. With a freewill-offering, will I sacrifice unto thee, I will praise thy Name, O Yahweh, for it is good;

7. For, out of all distress, hath he rescued me,—And, upon my foes, hath, mine own eye, looked.  

## Psalms 55

1. To the Chief Musician: with stringed Instruments. A Psalm of Instruction, of David. Give ear, O God, to my prayer, And do not hide thyself from my supplication:

2. Attend unto me, and answer me, I may ramble in my complaining, And be driven to and fro—

3. Because of the noise of the enemy, By reason of the oppression of the lawless one, For they would let trouble drop upon me, And, in anger, would they entrap me.

4. My heart, would writhe within me, And, the terrors of Death, have fallen upon me:

5. Fear and trembling, would enter me, And there would have overwhelmed me—a horror!

6. Then I said—Oh that there were given me a pinion, like a dove, I would fly away and be at rest:

7. Lo! I would take a distant flight, I would tarry in the wilderness. [Selah.]

8. I would hasten mine escape, From rushing wind, from storm. 

9.  Confuse, O My Lord, divide their speech, For I have seen violence and contention in the city;

10. Day and night, they go round her, upon her walls, And, trouble and misery, are in her midst;

11. Engulfing ruin, is in her midst, And there depart not from her broadway, oppression and deceit.

12. For it is, not an enemy, that reproacheth me, Or I could bear it,—Not one that hath hated me, who, against me, hath magnified himself, Or I might hide myself from him;

13. But it is, thou, a man esteemed as mine equal, mine associate, and mine acquaintance;

14. So that together have we been wont to find sweetness in counsel, In the house of God, used we to walk in the throng.

15. Desolations on them! Let them go down into hades alive, For, wicked doings, are at home within them. 

16.  I, unto God, will cry,—And, Yahweh, will save me.

17. At evening and morning and high noon, have I been wont to lament and complain, And he hath heard my voice!

18. He hath completely redeemed my soul, out of the attack upon me, For, in multitudes, were they [in conflict] with me.

19. GOD will hear, Yea He will humble them who aforetime sat [enthroned] . [Selah.] With whom are no changings, Neither have they revered God.

20. He hath thrust forth his hands, against them he was wont to salute, he hath violated his covenant;

21. Smoother than curds, were [the words of] his mouth, But, war, was [in] his heart,—Softer his words than oil, Yet, they, were drawn swords!

22. Cast upon Yahweh thy lot, and, he, will sustain thee: He will not suffer, to times age-abiding, the righteous one to be shaken.

23. But, thou, O God, wilt bring them down to the pit of destruction, Men of bloodshed and deceit, shall not live out half their days; But, I, will trust in thee.  

## Psalms 56

1. To the Chief Musician. Upon "The Dove of God from the distant Sea." David’s. A precious Psalm. When the Philistines seized him in Gath. Show me favour, O God, For weak man hath panted for me, All the day, a fighter oppresseth me:

2. Mine adversaries have panted all the day, For, many, are fighting with me, loftily.

3. What day I am afraid, I, unto thee will direct my confidence.

4. In God, I will praise his cause,—In God, have I trusted, I will not fear, What can flesh do unto me?

5. All the day, they wrest, my words, Against me, all their devices are for mischief;

6. They stir up strife—they lie hid, They, mark my steps,—Seeing they have waited for my life.

7. Because of iniquity, recompense thou them,—In anger, bring thou down, the peoples, O God. 

8.  My wandering, hast, thou, recorded,—Put thou my tears in thy bottle, Are they not in thy record?

9. Then, shall my foes turn back, in the day I cry, This, I know, for God is mine!

10. In God, will I praise with good cause: In Yahweh, will I praise with good cause;

11. In God, have I trusted, I will not fear, What can a son of earth do unto me!

12. Upon me, O God, are thy vows, I will pay back praises unto thee.

13. For thou hast rescued my soul from death, Wilt thou not [rescue] my feet from stumbling? That I may walk to and fro, before God, In the light of life.  

## Psalms 57

1. To the Chief Musician. "Do not destroy." A precious Psalm, of David. When he fled from the face of Saul into the Cave. Show me favour, O God, Show me favour, For, in thee, hath my soul sought refuge,—And, in the shadow of thy wings, will I seek refuge, Until the storm of ruin pass by.

2. I will cry unto God Most High, Unto GOD, who accomplisheth on my behalf:

3. He will send out of heaven, that he may save me, He who is panting for me, hath reproached. [Selah.] God will send out his lovingkindness and his faithfulness.

4. My soul, is in the midst of lions, I lie down amidst flames, As for the sons of men, Their teeth, are spear and arrows, And, their tongue, is a sharp sword.

5. Be exalted Above the Heavens, O God, Above all the earth, thy glory!

6. A net, did they fix for my steps, My soul was bowed down,—They digged before me a pit, They fell into the midst thereof! [Selah.] 

7.  Fixed is my heart, O God, Fixed is my heart, I will sing, and touch the strings.

8. Awake, mine honour, Awake, harp and lyre, I will awaken the dawn;

9. I will thank thee, among the peoples, O My Lord, I will praise thee in song, among the races of men.

10. For, great, unto the heavens, is thy lovingkindness, And, unto the skies, thy faithfulness.

11. Be exalted Above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth, thy glory!  

## Psalms 58

1. To the Chief Musician. "Do not Destroy." A precious Psalm, of David. Are ye, indeed, silent [when] righteousness, ye should speak? When, with equity, ye should judge, O ye sons of men?

2. Aye! ye all do work, perversity,—Throughout the land, your hands, weigh out, violence!

3. Lawless men have been estranged from birth, They have gone astray from their nativity, speaking falsehood;

4. Their poison, is like unto the poison of a serpent, Like the deaf adder, that stoppeth his ear;

5. That will not hearken to the voice of whisperers, Though the wise one try to bind him with spells. 

6.  O God! break away their teeth in their mouth, The biters of the young lions, knock thou out, O Yahweh!

7. Let such men flow away like waters that disperse themselves: He prepareth his arrow, Like [grass] let them be cut down:

8. Like a snail, which melteth away as it goeth, An untimely birth of a woman, which hath not seen the sun:

9. Before your kettles can perceive the [kindled] bramble, Be he green or be he withered, he shall be swept away.

10. The righteous man will rejoice when he hath seen an avenging, His feet, will he bathe in the blood of the lawless one:—

11. So that a son of earth may say—Surely there is fruit for the righteous man! Surely there are gods who judge in the earth!  

## Psalms 59

1. To the Chief Musician. "Do not Destroy." A precious Psalm of David. When Saul sent, and they watched the house, to kill him. Rescue me from my foes, O my God, From them who lift themselves up against me, wilt thou set me on high:

2. Rescue me, from the workers of iniquity, And, from the men of bloodshed, save me.

3. For lo! they have lain in wait for my life, Mighty ones stir up strife against me, Without transgression of mine, and without sin of mine, O Yahweh;

4. For no iniquity, do they run that they may take their stand, Rouse thyself to meet me, and see.

5. Thou, therefore, O Yahweh, God of hosts, God of Israel, Awake, to visit all the nations, Do not show favour to any iniquitous traitors. [Selah.]

6. They return at evening, They grow like a dog, And go round the city.

7. Lo! they belch forth with their mouth, Swords, are in their lips, For [say they], Who doth hear? 

8.  Thou, therefore, O Yahweh, wilt laugh at them, Thou wilt mock at all nations.

9. O my Strength, unto thee, will I make melody, For, God, is my high tower.

10. My God of lovingkindness, will come to meet me, God, will let me look on mine adversaries.

11. Do not slay them, lest my people forget, Cause them to wander by thy strength, and prostrate them, [Thou] our shield, O Lord!

12. The sin of their mouth, The word of their lips, Let them then be captured in their pride, Both for the oath and for the deception they record.

13. Bring to a full end in wrath, Bring to a full end, that they be no more,—That men may know that, God, is ruling in Jacob, Unto the ends of the earth. [Selah.]

14. Let them return, then, at evening, Let them growl like a dog, And go round the city.

15. They, may prowl about for food,—And, if they are not satisfied, then let them whine!

16. But, I, will sing thy power, And will shout aloud, in the morning, thy lovingkindness,—For thou has become a refuge for me, And a place to flee to in the day of my distress.

17. O my Strength, unto thee, will I make melody, For, God, is my high tower, my God of lovingkindness.  

## Psalms 60

1. To the Chief Musician. Upon "The Lily of Testimony." A precious Psalm of David, to instruct. When he waged war with Aram-neharaim, and with Aram-zobah,—and then Joab returned and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt, twelve thousand. O God, thou hast rejected us—hast scattered us, Thou hast been angry, Wilt thou restore us?

2. Thou hast shaken the land—hast rent it, Heal thou the fractures thereof—for it hath tottered:

3. Thou hast suffered thy people to see hardship, Thou hast let them drink the wine of confusion.

4. Thou hadst given—to them that revere thee—a banner, to float aloft, Because of [thy] faithfulness. [Selah.]

5. That thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save thou with thine own right hand—and answer us. 

6.  God, hath spoken in his holiness—I will exult! I will apportion Shechem, And, the Vale of Succoth, will I measure out;

7. Mine, is Gilead—and mine, Manasseh, But, Ephraim, is the defence, of my head, Judah, is my commander’s staff;

8. Moab, is my wash-bowl, Upon Edom, will I throw my shoe, Over Philistia! raise shout of triumph.

9. Who will conduct me to a fortified city? Who will lead me as far as Edom!

10. Is it not, thou, O God?—thou hast rejected us! And wilt thou not go forth, O God, with our hosts?

11. Grant us help out of distress, For, vain, is the deliverance of man:

12. In God, we shall do valiantly, He himself, therefore, will tread down our adversaries.  

## Psalms 61

1. To the Chief Musician. Upon a Stringed Instrument. David’s. Hear, O God, my loud cry, Attend unto my prayer:

2. From the end of the earth, unto thee do I cry, When my heart fainteth away, Unto a rock that is higher than I, wilt thou lead me.

3. For thou hast been, A Refuge to me, A Tower of Strength, from the face of the foe.

4. I would be a guest in thy tent to the ages, I would seek refuge in the concealment of thy wings. [Selah.] 

5.  For, thou, O God, hast hearkened to my vows, Thou hast granted a possession, unto them who revere thy Name.

6. Days—unto the days of the king, wilt thou add. His years, as of generation after generation:

7. Let him retain his seat age-abidingly before God, Appoint that, lovingkindness and faithfulness, my watch over him!

8. So, will I sing thy Name unto futurity, Paying my vows, day by day.  

## Psalms 62

1. To the Chief Musician. On Jeduthun—A Melody of David. Surely, towards God, silence [becometh] my soul, From him, is my salvation:

2. Surely, he, is my rock and my salvation, My high tower—I shall not be greatly shaken!

3. How long will ye shout at a man? Ye shall be crushed all of you,—Like a wall that bulgeth,—a fence pushed in!

4. Surely, from his elevation, they have taken counsel to thrust him down, They accept falsehood,—With his mouth, they each of them bless, But, inwardly, they revile. [Selah.]

5. Surely, towards God, be thou silent, my soul, For, from him, is mine expectation:

6. Surely, he, is my rock, and my salvation, My high tower—I shall not be shaken!

7. Upon God, [depend] my salvation and mine honour, My rock of strength, my refuge, are in God. 

8.  Trust ye in him all ye assembly of the people, Pour out, before him, your heart, God, is a refuge for us. [Selah.]

9. Surely, vanity, are men of low degree, Deception, men of high degree,—In the balances, they go up, They, are [made] of vanity, altogether.

10. Do not trust in extortion, Nor, with robbery, become vain, As for wealth, when it beareth fruit, Do not set [thereon your] heart.

11. One thing, hath God spoken, Two things, [there are] which I have heard, That, power, belongeth unto God;

12. And, thine, O My Lord, is lovingkindness,—For, thou, wilt pay back unto every man—according to his deed.  

## Psalms 63

1. A Melody of David. When he was in the Wilderness of Judah. O God, my GOD, thou art, Earnestly do I desire thee,—My soul thirsteth for thee, My flesh fainteth for thee, In a land—dry, and weary for want of water,—

2. In like manner as, in the sanctuary, I have had vision of thee, To behold thy power and thy glory. 

3.  Because better is thy lovingkindness than life, My lips, aloud shall praise thee!

4. Thus, will I bless thee while I live, In thy Name, will I lift up mine outspread hands:

5. As with fatness and richness, shall my soul be satisfied, And, with joyfully shouting lips, shall my mouth utter praise.

6. Should I call thee to mind upon my couch, In the watches of the night, would I breathe soft speech of thee. 

7.  For thou hast become a help unto me,—And, in the shadow of thy wings, will I shout for joy.

8. My soul hath run clinging to thee, On me, hath thy right hand laid hold.

9. When, they, to crush it, would seek my life, They shall go into the lower parts of the earth:

10. Every one shall be given up into the power of the sword, The portion of jackals, shall they become.

11. But, the king, shall rejoice in God,—Every one shall glory who sweareth by him, For the mouth of them who speak falsehood, shall be stopped.  

## Psalms 64

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. Hear, O God, my voice when I complain, From dread peril by the foe, wilt thou guard my life.

2. Wilt thou hide me, From the conclave of evil-doers, From the crowd of workers of iniquity.

3. Who have sharpened, like a sword, their tongue, Have made ready their arrow—a bitter word;

4. To shoot, in secret places, at the blameless one, Suddenly they shoot at him, and fear not.

5. They strengthen for them a wicked word, They talk of hiding snares, They have said, Who can see them?

6. They devise perverse things, They have completed the device well devised, Both the intent of each one, and the mind, are unsearchable. 

7.  Once let God have shot at them an arrow, Suddenly have appeared their own wounds!

8. When they were to have ruined another, their tongue smote themselves, All who observe them take flight.

9. Therefore have all men feared,—And have told the doing of God, And, his work, have considered.

10. The righteous man shall rejoice in Yahweh, and seek refuge in him, Then shall glory—all who are upright in heart.  

## Psalms 65

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David—a song. Thine, are silence [and] praise, O God, in Zion,—And, to thee, shall be paid the vow.

2. Thou hearer of prayer! Unto thee, shall all flesh come.

3. Iniquitous things, have been too strong for me, As for our transgressions, wilt, thou, by propitiation remove them.

4. How happy the man thou shalt choose and bring near! He shall abide in thy courts,—We shall be satisfied with, The blessing of thy house, The holiness of thy temple.

5. By things reverend in righteousness, wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation, The confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of the sea far away; 

6.  Who setteth fast the mountains by his strength, Being girded with might;

7. Who stilleth, The noise of the seas, The noise of their rolling waves, and The tumult of races of men?

8. Yea the dwellers in the uttermost parts have feared at thy tokens, The goings forth of morning and evening, thou causest to shout for joy.

9. Thou hast visited the earth, and made it abound, Abundantly, dost thou enrich it—The channel of God, is full of waters, Thou preparest their corn, Yea, thus, dost thou prepare it:

10. The ridges thereof, drenching, Settling the furrows thereof, With myriad drops, dost thou soften it, The sprouting thereof, doth thou bless.

11. Thou hast set a crown upon thy year of bounty, And, thy tracks, drop fatness;

12. Fruitful are the pastures of the wilderness, And, with exultation, the hills do gird themselves.

13. Clothed are the pastures with flocks, The valleys also, cover themselves with corn, They shout for joy, yea they sing.  

## Psalms 66

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melodious Song. Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth;

2. Praise ye in song the glory of his Name, Celebrate the glory of his praise:

3. Say unto God—How fearful in thy doings, Through the abounding of thy power, shall thy foes come cringing unto thee;

4. All the earth, shall bow themselves down to thee, And sing praises unto thee,. Shall praise in song thy Name. [Selah.]

5. Come and see the doings of God,—Fearful in deed toward the sons of men:

6. He turned the sea into dry land, Through the stream, crossed they over on foot, There did we rejoice in him:

7. Who ruleth, in his might, unto times age abiding, His eyes, over the nations, keep watch, The rebellious, let them not exalt themselves. [Selah.] 

8.  Bless our God, O ye peoples, And cause to be heard, the sound of his praise;—

9. Who hath set our soul among the living, And hath not suffered, our foot, to slip.

10. For thou didst prove us, O God, Thou didst refine us, according to the refining of silver:

11. Thou didst bring us into the hunter’s net, Thou didst lay a load upon our loins;

12. Thou didst let men ride at our head; We went into fire and into water, But thou didst bring us forth into freedom. 

13.  I will enter thy house with ascending-sacrifices, I will pay unto thee my vows,

14. Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, in my distress.

15. Ascending-sacrifices of fatlings, will I cause to ascend unto thee, With the perfume of rams, I will offer bulls, with he-goats. [Selah.]

16. Come! hearken—that I may recount, all ye reverers of God, What he hath done for my soul:—

17. Unto him—with my mouth, did I cry, And high praise was under my tongue.

18. If, iniquity, I had cared for in my heart, My Lord, had not heard me!

19. But in truth, God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

20. Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his own lovingkindness from me.  

## Psalms 67

1. To the Chief Musician. With stringed Instruments. A Melody, a Song. God, be favorable to us and bless us, Cause his face to shine upon us. [Selah.]

2. That thy way may be known throughout the earth, Throughout all nations, thy saving help!

3. Peoples will praise thee, O God, Peoples will, all of them, praise thee,

4. Races of men, will be glad and shout for joy, Because thou wilt judge peoples with equity, And, races of men throughout the earth, thou wilt lead. [Selah.]

5. Peoples will praise thee, O God,—Peoples will, all of them, praise thee.

6. Earth, will have given her increase, God, our own God, will bless us:

7. God, will bless us, That all the ends of the earth, may revere him.  

## Psalms 68

1. To the Chief Musician. David’s. A Melody, a Song. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered, Yea let them that hate him flee before him:

2. As smoke is driven about, Let them be driven about,—As wax is melted before a fire, Let the lawless perish before God.

3. But let, the righteous, be glad, let them exult before God, Yea let them rejoice with gladness.

4. Sing ye to God, Make music of his Name,—Lift up (a song), to him that rideth through the waste plains,—Since Yah is his name, exult ye before him.

5. The father of the fatherless, And the advocate of widows, Is God, in his holy habitation.

6. God, is he that causeth the solitary to dwell in a home, That bringeth out prisoners into prosperity, But, the rebellious, have made their habitation in a sunburnt land. 

7.  O God! When thou camest forth before thy people, When thou didst stride through the wilderness, [Selah.]

8. Earth, trembled, Yea, the heavens, dripped at the presence of God,—This Sinai—at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

9. A bounteous rain, dost thou shed abroad, O God, upon thine inheritance, When exhausted, thou thyself, hast supported it:

10. Thy living host, have remained therein, Thou dost provide, in thy bounty, for the humbled ones—O God!

11. Let, My Lord, but give the word, The herald bands, will be a mighty host:

12. Kings of armies, they flee! they flee! And, she that stayeth at home, shall share the spoil.

13. Though ye rest between the folds, The wings of the dove, shall be covered with silver, And, her pinions, with green-shimmering gold.

14. When the Almighty scattereth kings therein, It will gleam like snow in the gloom: 

15.  A mighty mountain, is the mountain of Bashan, A mountain of peaks, is the mountain of Bashan!—

16. Wherefore start ye up, ye mountains, ye peaks? The mountain God hath coveted for his habitation, Surely, Yahweh will inhabit it ever!

17. The chariots of God, are two myriads—thousands repeated, My Lord, is among them Sinai, is in the sanctuary!

18. Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led in procession a body of captives, Thou hast received gifts consisting of men, Yea even the rebellious, That, Yah, Elohim, might settle down to rest.

19. Blessed be My Lord! Day by day, he beareth our burden for us, GOD himself, is our salvation. [Selah.]

20. The GOD we have, is a GOD of saving deeds, And, due to Yahweh, My Lord, are escapes from death.

21. Yea, God himself, will smite through the head of his foes,—The hairy crown of him that is marching on in his guilty deeds. 

22.  Said My Lord, From Bashan, will I bring back,—I will bring back from the depths of the sea:

23. That thou mayest bathe thy foot in blood,—The tongue of thy dogs, from the foes, hath its portion.

24. They have seen thy progress O God, The progress of my GOD, my king into the sanctuary:

25. In front are the singers, Behind are the harpers, In the midst of damsels playing on timbrels:

26. In the congregations, bless ye God, My Lord, from among the called of Israel:

27. There, is Benjamin, the Diminutive—ruling them, The princes of Judah—their throng, The princes of Zebulun, The princes of Naphtali.

28. Thy God hath commanded thy strength,—The strength, O God, which thou hast wrought for us.

29. Because of thy temple above Jerusalem, Unto thee, shall kings bear along a gift—

30. Rebuke thou, The wild beast of the reeds, The herd of mighty oxen among the calves of the peoples—Each one bowing down with bars of silver,—Scatter thou the peoples, who in wars take delight.

31. Ambassadors come out of Egypt, The Ethiopian, eagerly stretcheth out his hands, unto God. 

32.  Ye kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God, Praise in song Adonay. [Selah.]

33. Unto him that rideth upon the most ancient heavens, Lo! he uttereth his voice, a voice of strength.

34. Ascribe ye strength unto God,—Over Israel, is his majesty, And his strength, in the skies. To be revered is God, for his sanctuary,—

35. As for the GOD of Israel, he, is giving strength and abundant might to the people. Blessed be God!  

## Psalms 69

1. To the Chief Musician. On "The Lilies." David’s. Save me, O God, For waters have entered as far as the life;

2. I have sunk in deep swamp, Where there is no place to stand, I have come into abysses of waters, Where a flood hath overflowed me;

3. I am weary with mine outcry, Parched is my throat,—Mine eyes have become dim, through waiting for my God.

4. More than the hairs of my head, Are they who hate me without cause,—Firmer than my bones, Are they who are my foes for false cause,—What I had not plundered, then, had I to restore.

5. O God, thou, hast known my folly, And, my wrong-doings, from thee, have not been hid.

6. Let them not be ashamed, through me, Who have waited for thee, O My Lord, Yahweh of hosts,—Let them not be confounded, through me, Who are seeking thee, O God of Israel!

7. Because, for thy sake, have I borne reproach, Confusion hath covered my face;

8. One estranged, have I become, to my own brethren, Yea, an alien, to the sons of my own mother;

9. Because, zeal for thy house, hath eaten me up, And, the reproaches of them who have reproached thee, have fallen upon me.

10. When I have humbled my soul with fasting, Then hath it turned to my reproach;

11. When I have made my clothing of sackcloth, Then have I served them for a by-word;

12. They who sit in the gate talk against me,—And [against me are] the songs of them who imbibe strong drink. 

13.  But, as for me, my prayer shall be unto thee, O Yahweh, in a time of acceptance, O God, in the abounding of thy lovingkindness, answer me with thy saving faithfulness.

14. Rescue me out of the mire, lest I sink, Let me be rescued, From my haters, and, From abysses of waters:

15. Let not a flood of waters overflow me, And let not the depth swallow me up, Neither let the well close, over me, her mouth.

16. Answer me, O Yahweh, for good is thy lovingkindness, According to the abounding of thy compassions, turn thou towards me:

17. Then do not hide thy face from thy servant, Because I am in distress, haste thou—answer me!

18. Oh draw near unto my soul—redeem it, Because of mine enemies, ransom me.

19. Thou, knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion, Before thee, are all mine adversaries.

20. Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am weak,—Though I waited for one to pity me, yet there was none, And for comforters, yet I found not any.

21. But they put in my food—poison! And, for my thirst, they gave for my drink—vinegar! 

22.  Let their table, before them, become a snare, And unto their friends, a lure;

23. Let their eyes become too dim to see, And, their loins, continually cause thou to shake;

24. Pour out over them thine indignation, And let, the glow of thine anger, overtake them:

25. Let their encampment become desolate, In their tents, be there none to dwell:

26. For, whom, thou thyself, hadst smitten, they pursued, And, unto the pain of thy wounded ones, they must needs add.

27. Lay punishment on their iniquity, And let them not enter into thy righteousness;

28. Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And, with the righteous, let them not be enrolled.

29. I, then, am humbled and in pain, Thy salvation, O God, may it set me on high. 

30.  I will praise the Name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving;

31. So shall it be more pleasing to Yahweh than a bullock of the herd, Showing horn [and] divided hoof.

32. The humbled have seen—they rejoice! Ye seekers of God, let your heart, then, revive;

33. For, a Hearkener to the needy, is Yahweh, And, his prisoners, hath he not despised.

34. Let the heavens and the earth, praise him, The seas, and everything that creepeth therein.

35. For, God, will save Zion, And build the cities of Judah, So shall men dwell there, and possess it:

36. Yea, the seed of his servants, shall inherit it, And, the lovers of his Name, shall settle down therein.  

## Psalms 70

1. To the Chief Musician. David’s. To call to Remembrance. [Be pleased] O God, to rescue me, O Yahweh, to help me—make haste.

2. Let them turn pale and then at once blush, Who are seeking my life,—Let them draw back, and be confounded, Who are taking pleasure in my misfortune;

3. Let them turn back, on account of their own shame, Who are saying, Aha! Aha!

4. Let all them be glad and rejoice in thee, Yea, let them, who are seekers of thee,—say continually, God be magnified! Who are lovers of thy salvation.

5. But, I, being humbled and needy, O God, haste to me,—My help and my deliverer, art thou, O Yahweh do not tarry.  

## Psalms 71

1. In thee, O Yahweh, have I sought refuge, May I not be ashamed unto times age-abiding:

2. In thy righteousness, wilt thou rescue me, and deliver me, Incline unto me thine ear, and save me:

3. Be thou unto me, a Rock to dwell in, a Place of Security, To save me, For, my mountain crag and my stronghold, thou art.

4. Oh my God, deliver me, From the hand of the lawless one, From the clutch of the perverse and ruthless one;

5. For, thou, art my hope, My Lord, Yahweh, My confidence from my youthful days:

6. Upon thee, have I stayed myself from birth, Thou art he that severed me, from the body of my mother, Of thee, shall be my praise—continually.

7. A very wonder, have I been unto many, Seeing that, thou, hast been my strong refuge,

8. My mouth shall be filled with, thy praise, All the day, with thy splendour.

9. Do not cast me off in the time of old age, When my vigour faileth, do not forsake me;

10. For mine enemies have spoken of me, And, they who watch for my life, have taken counsel together;

11. Saying, God, hath forsaken him, Pursue and take him, For there is none to rescue.

12. O God, be not far from me, O my God, to help me, make haste!

13. Let them be ashamed—be consumed, Who are assailing my life,—Let them be covered with reproach and confusion, Who are seeking my hurt. 

14.  But, I, continually will hope, And will add to all thy praise;

15. My mouth, shall relate thy righteousness, All the day, thy deliverance, For I know not the numbers.

16. I will enter into the mighty doings of My Lord—Yahweh, I will make mention of thy righteousness—thine alone.

17. O God, thou hast taught me from my youthful days, And, hitherto, have I been wont to tell of thy wonders;

18. Even now, therefore, that I am old and grayheaded, O God, do not forsake me,—Until I tell of thine arm unto a [new] generation, Unto every one that is to come, thy might;

19. And, as for thy righteousness, O God, up on high, Wherein thou hast wrought great things, O God! who is like unto thee?

20. Thou who hast let us see many distresses and misfortunes, Wilt again bring us to life, And, out of the resounding depths of the earth, wilt again raise us up;

21. Thou wilt increase my greatness, And, on every side, wilt comfort me.

22. I also, will praise thee by the aid of a harp, Thy faithfulness, O my God,—I will make music unto thee with a lyre, Thou holy one of Israel;

23. My lips shall make a joyful noise, When I make music unto thee, And my soul which thou hast ransomed;

24. Even my tongue, all the day, shall softly utter thy righteousness, For they have turned pale—for they have blushed, Who were seeking my hurt.  

## Psalms 72

1. Solomon’s. O God! thy justice, give, unto the king, And thy righteousness, unto the son of a king; 

2.  May he judge, Thy people with righteousness; And thine oppressed ones with justice;

3. May the mountains bring peace to the people, And the hills [be laden] with righteousness;

4. May he, Vindicate the oppressed of the people, Bring deliverance to the children of the needy, and, Crush the oppressor.

5. Let men revere thee, With the sun, And in presence of the moon, Unto the remotest generation.

6. Let him come down, Like rain on fields to be mown, Like myriad drops on land to be reaped.

7. May righteousness, in his days, blossom forth, And abundance of peace, till there be no moon.

8. So let him have dominion, From sea to sea, And from the River [="Euphrates"] unto the ends of the earth;

9. Before him, let the men of the desert kneel, But, as for his foes, the dust, let them lick;

10. The kings of Tarshish and of the Coastlands, A gift, let them render, The kings of Sheba and Seba, A present, let them bring;

11. Yea let all kings, bow down unto him, Let, all nations, serve him;

12. Because he Rescueth, The needy from the rich, The oppressed, who hath no helper;

13. He Pitieth the weak and the needy, And, the lives of the needy, he Saveth:

14. From extortion, and, violence, he Redeemeth their life, And precious is their blood in his sight.

15. Let him live, then! And be there given unto him of the gold of Sheba,—Let prayer also be offered for him continually, All the day, let him be blessed.

16. May there be an abundance of corn in the earth, in the top of the mountains,—Let the fruit thereof, wave like Lebanon, And they of the city bloom like the fresh shoots of the earth.

17. May his Name be age-abiding, In the presence of the sun, let his Name flourish,—And may all the families of the ground bless themselves in him, All nations, pronounce him happy! 

18.  Blessed be Yahweh God, the God of Israel,—Who doeth wondrous things by himself alone;

19. And blessed be his glorious Name, unto times age-abiding,—And filled with his glory be all the earth, Amen and Amen!

20. Ended are the prayers of David, son of Jesse.  

## Psalms 73

1. A Melody of Asaph. Nothing but good, is God, Unto Israel, Unto the pure in heart.

2. But, as for me,—My feet had, almost stumbled, My steps had, well-nigh slipped;

3. For I was envious of the boasters, At the prosperity of the lawless, used I to look.

4. For they have no pangs in their death, And vigorous is their body;

5. Of the toil of weak mortals, have they none, Nor, with the sons of earth, are they hard smitten.

6. For this cause, doth arrogance deck them as a neck-chain, And a garment of wrong is their attire;

7. Their iniquity, hath proceeded from fatness, They have surpassed the imaginations of the heart;

8. They mock, and wickedly command oppression, From on high, they command;

9. They have set, in the heavens, their mouth, And, their tongue, marcheth through the earth.

10. Therefore must his people return thither, And, the waters of abundance, are drained by them;

11. And they say—How doth GOD know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?

12. Lo! these, are the lawless, Who are secure for an age, They have attained unto wealth.

13. Altogether in vain, Have I cleansed my heart, And bathed in pureness, my hands;

14. And yet been smitten all the day, And been rebuked morning by morning! 

15.  If I had thought, I will relate it thus, Lo! the circle of thy sons, had I betrayed.

16. When I reasoned, that I might understand this, A vexation, it was in mine eyes:

17. Until I could enter the holy places of God,—Could give heed to their hereafter:—

18. Surely, in slippery places, dost thou set them,—Thou hast suffered them to fall into places of danger.

19. How have they become desolate, as in a moment! They have ceased—come to an end, by reason of calamities.

20. As the dream of him that waketh, O my Lord! when rousing thyself up, their shadowy being, wilt thou despise. 

21.  But my heart had grown embittered, And, in my reins, had I received wounds;

22. But, I, was brutish, and could not perceive, Like the beasts, had I become before thee.

23. Nevertheless, I, am continually before thee, Thou hast taken hold of my right hand;

24. By thy counsel, wilt thou guide me, And, afterwards, unto glory, wilt thou take me.

25. Whom have I in the heavens? And, compared with thee, there is nothing I desire on earth.

26. Failed have my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart—and my portion, is God unto times age-abiding.

27. For lo! they who are far from thee, shall perish, Thou hast put an end to every one who wandered unchastely from thee.

28. But, as for me, the drawing near of God, is my blessedness,—I have made, of My Lord Yahweh, my refuge,—That I may recount all thy works.  

## Psalms 74

1. An Instructive Psalm. Asaph’s. Wherefore, O God, hast thou cast off utterly? Shall thine anger smoke against the flock of thine own pasturing?

2. Remember thine own assembly thou didst acquire aforetime, Thou didst redeem the tribe of thine own inheritance, Mount Zion, wherein thou didst take up thy habitation.

3. Lift up thy steps unto the places utterly unsafe, All the mischief!—the foe in the sanctuary!

4. Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine appointed meeting, They have set their ensigns as tokens!

5. One used to be known according as he carried up high—into the thicket of trees—the axes;

6. But, now, the doors thereof all together, with axes and hammers, they batter down.

7. They have cast, into the fire, thy sanctuary, To the ground, have they profaned the habitation of thy Name.

8. They have said in their heart, Let us suppress them altogether, They have burned up all the meeting-places of GOD in the land.

9. Our own signs, have we not seen,—There is no longer a prophet,—Neither is there with us, one who knoweth—How long!

10. How long, O God, shall the adversary, reproach? Shall the enemy revile thy Name perpetually?

11. Wherefore shouldst thou withdraw thy hand—thy right hand? [Bring it] out of the midst of thy bosom! [Selah.] 

12.  But, God, hath been my king from aforetime, Working Deliverances in the midst of the earth.

13. Thou, didst cleave asunder, in thy might, the sea, Thou didst break in pieces the heads of the Crocodiles, [till they floated] on the waters;

14. Thou, didst crush the heads of the Sea-Monster, Thou didst give him to be food, for the people of the deserts;

15. Thou, didst cleave open fountain and torrent, Thou, didst dry up rivers of steady flow:

16. Thine, is the day, Yea, thine, the night, Thou, didst establish moon and sun;

17. Thou, didst set up all the bounds of the earth, As for summer and winter, thou, didst form them! 

18.  Remember this, An enemy, hath reproached Yahweh, Yea, an impious people, have reviled thy Name.

19. Do not deliver up, to a wild beast, the life of thy turtle-dove, The living host of thine oppressed ones, do not forget perpetually.

20. Have respect to thy covenant, For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.

21. May the crushed one not again be confounded, As for the oppressed and the needy, let them praise thy Name.

22. Arise! O God, plead thine own cause, Remember the reproach of thee, from the impious one, all the day:

23. Do not forget the voice of thine adversaries, The noise of thine assailants, ascending continually.  

## Psalms 75

1. To the Chief Musician. "Do not Destroy." A Melody of Asaph, a Song. We have given thanks unto thee, O God, we have given thanks, And, in calling upon thy Name, men have recounted thy wonders.

2. Surely I will take a set time,—I, with equity, will judge:

3. Earth was melting away with all its inhabitants, I, have fixed the pillars thereof. [Selah.]

4. I have said to the boasters, Do not boast, And to the lawless, Do not lift up a horn;

5. Do not lift up on high your horn, Nor speak of the Rock, with arrogance; 

6.  For neither from east nor west, Nor from the wilderness of the mountains [cometh exaltation] ;

7. For, God himself, is about to judge, One, he will cast down, Another, he will lift up;

8. For, a cup, is in the hand of Yahweh, Whose wine is foaming, It is full of spiced wine, Which he hath caused to flow from one to another,—Surely, the dregs thereof, they shall drain out—they shall drink, Even all the lawless ones of the earth.

9. But, I, will exult unto times age-abiding, I will sing praises unto the God of Jacob;

10. But, all the horns of the lawless, will I hew off,—Exalted shall be the horns of the Righteous One.  

## Psalms 76

1. To the Chief Musician. With Stringed Instruments. A Melody of Asaph, a Song. God is, known in Judah, In Israel, great is his Name;

2. Now hath come into Salem, his pavilion, And his dwelling-place into Zion.

3. There, hath he broken in pieces the arrows of the bow, shield and sword, and battle. [Selah.]

4. Enveloped in light, thou, art more majestic than the mountains of prey.

5. The valiant of heart have become a spoil, They have slumbered their sleep, And none of the men of might have found their hands.

6. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Stunned are the horsemen. 

7.  As for thee, to be feared thou art! Who then shall stand before thee, because of the power of thine anger?

8. Out of the heavens, didst thou cause judgment to be heard, Earth, feared and was still:

9. When God rose up to judgment, To save all the oppressed of the earth. [Selah.]

10. For the multitude of mankind shall give thanks unto thee, The remainder of the multitude, shall keep holy festival unto thee.

11. Vow and pay, unto Yahweh your God,—Let, all who are round about him, bear along a gift unto him who is to be revered.

12. He cutteth off the spirit of nobles, he is of reverend majesty to the kings of the earth.  

## Psalms 77

1. To the Chief Musician. On "Jeduthun." Asaph’s, a Melody. With my voice—unto God, will I make outcry, With my voice unto God, and he will give ear unto me;

2. In the day of my distress—unto My Lord, will I seek, My hand, by night, hath been outstretched and never once became slack, My soul, hath refused to be consoled;

3. I remember God and I murmur, I muse, and my spirit swooneth. [Selah.]

4. Thou hast held, watching, mine eyes, I was driven to and fro, and could not speak;

5. I reasoned, Of the days of aforetime, Of the years of by-gone ages;

6. I remember my song in the night,—With my own heart, I commune, And my spirit, maketh search:—

7. For ages, will My Lord reject? And, not again, grant acceptance any more?

8. Hath his lovingkindness, come to a perpetual end? Hath his word failed to generation after generation?

9. Hath GOD, forgotten to show favour? Or hath he shut up, in anger, his compassions? [Selah.]

10. Then said I—An affliction to me, it is, The changing of the right hand of the Most High. 

11.  I will remember the doings of Yah, Surely I will remember, out of aforetime, thy wonderful way;

12. And will talk to myself of all thy work, And, of thy doings, will I muse:—

13. O God, in the sanctuary, is thy way,—Who is a great GOD like Elohim?

14. Thou, art GOD, doing wonderfully,—Thou hast made known, among the peoples, thy might;

15. Thou didst redeem, with thine arm—Thy people, Thy sons of Jacob and Joseph. [Selah.]

16. The waters saw thee, O God, The waters saw thee, They were in birth-throes, Yea the resounding deeps were stirred;

17. The clouds, poured down waters, The skies uttered, a voice, Yea, thine arrows, flew hither and thither;

18. The, voice of thy thunder, was in the whirlwind, Thy lightnings illumined the world, The earth, trembled and quaked;

19. In the sea, was thy way, And, thy path, in the mighty waters, And, thy footprints, could not be known:

20. Thou didst lead, like a flock, thy people, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.  

## Psalms 78

1. An Instructive Psalm. Asaph’s. Give ear, O my people, to mine instruction, Bend your ear to the sayings of my mouth;

2. I will open, in a parable, my mouth, I will pour forth enigmas out of antiquity;—

3. Which we have heard, and come to know, And, our fathers, have recounted to us;

4. We will not withhold [them] from their children, To a later generation, recounting the praises of Yahweh, Even his might and his wonders which he wrought;

5. When he set up a testimony in Jacob, And, a law, appointed in Israel,—Which he commanded our fathers, That they might make them known to their children;

6. To the end, A later generation, might come to know, Children who should be born, Who should arise, and recount [them] to their children;

7. That they might set, in Elohim, their confidence,—And not forget the doings of El, But, his commandments, might observe;

8. And not become, like their fathers, a generation stubborn and rebellious,—A generation that fixed not their heart, Neither was their spirit, faithful with GOD. 

9.  The sons of Ephraim—armed bowmen, Turned in the day of battle;

10. They kept not the covenant of God, And, in his law, refused to walk;

11. And forgat His doings, And his wonders which he had showed them:

12. In presence of their fathers, wrought he, wondrously,—In the land of Egypt—the field of Zoan:

13. He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through, And reared up the waters like a mound;

14. And led them, by a cloud, in the daytime, And all the night, by a light of fire;

15. He used to cleave rocks in the desert, And let them drink as out of mighty deeps;

16. And he brought forth streams out of the cliff, And caused waters to flow down, like rivers.

17. But again, once more sinned they against him, Resisting the Most High in a land of drought:

18. They put GOD to the proof in their heart, By asking food to their mind:

19. Yea they spake against Elohim,—They said, Can GOD prepare a table in the desert?

20. Lo! he hath smitten a rock, And waters, have gushed out, Yea, torrents, have rushed along,—Food also, can he give? Or provide flesh for his people?

21. Therefore, Yahweh hearkened, and became wroth,—And, a fire, was kindled against Jacob, Moreover also, anger, mounted against Israel;

22. Because, They believed not in God, Nor trusted in his salvation;

23. Though he had commanded the skies above, And, the doors of the heavens, had opened;

24. And had rained on them manna to eat, And, the corn of the heavens, had given to them:

25. The food of the mighty, each one did eat, Nourishment, sent he them to the full;

26. He let loose an east wind in the heavens, Then guided he, in his might, a south wind;

27. And rained upon them flesh as the dust, And, like the sand of the seas, birds of wing;

28. And let them fall in the midst of their camp,—Round about their habitations.

29. So they did eat and were abundantly filled, When, what they longed for, he had brought them:—

30. They had not turned away from what they had longed for, Yet was their food in their mouth,

31. When, the anger of God, mounted against them, And he slew of their vigorous youths, And, the choice young men of Israel, caused he to bow down in death.

32. For all this, sinned they still, And believed not in his wonders;

33. So he ended, in a breath, their days, And their years, in a sudden terror!

34. If he slew [of] them, then they sought him, Yea they turned, and did earnestly seek GOD;

35. And remembered that, Elohim, was their rock, Yea, EL Most High, their Redeemer:

36. So they spake him fair with their mouth, And, with their tongue, did promise him falsely;

37. But, their heart, was not fixed with him, Nor were they trusty in his covenant:

38. Yet, he, full of compassion, would put a propitiatory-covering over iniquity, and not destroy,—Yea, many a time, turned he back his anger, And would not stir up all his wrath.

39. So then he remembered, That, Flesh, they were, A Wind departing, that returneth not. 

40.  How often they, Resisted him in the desert, Vexed him, in the waste:

41. Yea they again put GOD to the test, And, to the Holy One of Israel, caused they sorrow:

42. They remembered not his hand—The day, When he ransomed them from the adversary;

43. When he set, in Egypt, his signs, And his wonders, in the plain of Zoan;

44. When he turned, into blood, their Nile-streams, And, their own rivers, could they not drink;

45. He sent among them, The gad-fly, and it devoured them, And the frog, and it despoiled them;

46. When he gave to the corn-locust their produce, And their toil, to the swarming locust;

47. He killed, with hail, their vine, And their sycomores, with frost:

48. When he gave up, to hail-storms, their beasts, And their cattle, to pestilent fevers;

49. He sent among them the heat of his anger, Wrath and indignation and distress,—A mission of messengers of misfortune:

50. He leveled a path for his anger, Withheld not, from death, their soul, But, their life—to the pestilence, he delivered:

51. So he smote, Every first-born in Egypt, The beginning of their strength, in the tents of Ham;

52. And he set forth, like sheep, his people, And guided them, like a flock in the desert;

53. Yea he led them securely, and they dreaded not, And, their enemies, the sea did cover.

54. Then brought he them within his own holy bounds, The mountain-range, which his right hand made his own:

55. So he drave out, before them, [whole] nations, And allotted them, by line, an inheritance, And caused to dwell, in their own homes, the tribes of Israel.

56. But they tested and resisted God Most High, And, his testimonies, did not observe;

57. But drew back and dealt treacherously, like their fathers, They turned aside, like deceitful bowmen;

58. And provoked him to anger with their high places, And, with their images, used to move him to jealousy.

59. God heard and was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;

60. So he gave up the habitation of Shiloh, The tent he had set up among Men;

61. Yea he gave up, into captivity, his strength, And his beauty into the hand of an adversary;

62. And delivered up, to the sword, his people, And, with his own inheritance, was he wroth;

63. His young men, were devoured by fire, And, his virgins, were not praised in song;

64. His priests, by the sword, did fall, And, his widows, were not able to bewail.

65. Then awoke, as one that had slept, Adonay, As a warrior exulting with wine!

66. So he smote his adversaries in the rear, Reproach age-abiding, laid he upon them.

67. Howbeit he rejected the tent of Joseph, And, the tribe of Ephraim, did not choose:

68. But made choice of the tribe of Judah, The mountain of Zion, which he loved;

69. And built, like the heights, his sanctuary, Like the earth, he founded it to times age-abiding.

70. And made choice of David his servant, And took him from among the folds of the sheep:

71. From after the sucking ewes, he brought him in,—To be shepherd to Jacob his people, And to Israel, his inheritance.

72. So he did shepherd them, according to the singleness of his heart, And, with the discernment of his hands, used he to guide them.  

## Psalms 79

1. A Melody of Asaph. O God, nations, Have entered thine inheritance, Have profaned thy holy temple,—Have laid Jerusalem in heaps:

2. They have given, The dead bodies of thy servants, As food for the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy men of lovingkindness, Unto the wild beast of the earth:

3. They have poured out their blood like water, Round about Jerusalem, With none to bury.

4. We have become, A reproach to our neighbours,—A mockery and a derision, to them who are round about us.

5. How long, O Yahweh, wilt thou be angry utterly? Shall thy jealousy, burn like fire? 

6.  Pour out thy wrath, Upon the nations that have not known thee—and, Upon the kingdoms that, on thy Name, have not called.

7. For he hath devoured Jacob,—And, his dwelling-place, have they laid waste.

8. Do not remember against us former iniquities,—Haste thee, let thy compassions, come to meet us, For we have been brought very low!

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, on account of the glory of thy Name,—Rescue us then, and put a propitiatory-covering over our sins, For the sake of thy Name.

10. Wherefore should the nations say—Where is their God? Let him be known among the nations before our eyes! [Yea! By] the avenging of the blood of thy servants which hath been shed!

11. Let the groaning of the prisoner, come in before thee,—According to the greatness of thine arm, Set free them who are appointed to death.

12. Return, therefore, unto our neighbours—Sevenfold, into their own bosom, The reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Adonay!

13. So, we, thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks unto thee, to times age-abiding,—To generation after generation, will we recount thy praise.  

## Psalms 80

1. To the Chief Musician. For "the Lilies of Testimony." Asaph’s. A Melody. O Shepherd of Israel, give ear, Thou who leddest forth Joseph like a rock, Thou who art throned on the cherubim, appear!

2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy strength, And come! to our salvation.

3. O God, bring us back, And light up thy face, That we may be saved.

4. O Yahweh, God of hosts! How long hast thou been wroth with the prayer of thy people?

5. Thou hast fed them with the food of tears, And hast caused them to drink the water of weeping in threefold abundance.

6. Thou dost make us an object of contention to our neighbours, And, our foes, find mockery for themselves.

7. O God of hosts, bring us back, And light up thy face, That we may be saved. 

8.  A vine out of Egypt, thou didst remove, Thou didst cast out nations, and plant it;

9. Thou didst make a clear space before it, So it rooted well its roots, and filled up the land;

10. Covered were the mountains with its shade, And, with its boughs, the mighty cedars.

11. It thrust forth its branches as far as the sea,—And, unto the River, its shoots.

12. Wherefore hast thou broken down its fences, So that all who pass along the way, pluck its fruit?

13. The boar out of the forest, browseth upon it, And, the wild beast of the field, pastureth thereon.

14. O God of hosts, return, we pray thee,—Look down out of the heavens, and see, And inspect this vine:

15. Yea the stock which thy right hand planted, Even upon the son thou didst secure for thyself.

16. To be burned with fire, it is cut down,—At the rebuke of thy countenance, they will perish.

17. Let thy hand be, Upon the Man of thy right hand, Upon the Son of Man thou didst secure for thyself;

18. So will we not draw back from thee, Thou wilt bring us to life, And, on thy Name, will we call.

19. O Yahweh, God of hosts! bring us back, Light up thy face, That we may be saved.  

## Psalms 81

1. To the Chief Musician. On "the Gittith." Asaph’s. Shout ye for joy, unto God our strength, Sound the note of triumph, to the God of Jacob;

2. Raise a melody, and strike the timbrel, The lyre so sweet, with the harp:

3. Blow, at the new moon, the horn, At the full moon, for the day of our sacred festival:

4. For, a statute to Israel, it is, A regulation, by the God of Jacob;

5. A testimony in Joseph, he appointed it, When he went forth over the land of Egypt: A language I liked not, used I to hear;

6. I took away, from the burden, his shoulder, his hands, from the clay, were set free.

7. In distress, thou didst cry, and I delivered thee,—I answered thee, within a hiding-place of thunder, I proved thee by the waters of Meribah. [Selah.] 

8.  Hear, O my people, and I will adjure thee, O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me!

9. There shall not be, within thee, a foreign GOD,—Neither shalt thou bow down to a strange GOD:

10. I, Yahweh, am thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,—Open wide thy mouth, that I may fill it.

11. But my people, hearkened not, unto my voice, Even, Israel, inclined not unto me.

12. So then I let them go on in the stubbornness of their own heart,[—] They might walk in their own counsels!

13. If, my people, were hearkening unto me, [If,] Israel, in my ways, would walk,

14. Right soon, their foes, would I subdue, And, against their adversaries, would I turn my hand:

15. The haters of Yahweh, should come cringing unto him, Then let their own good time be age-abiding!

16. Then would he feed them from the marrow of the wheat, Yea, out of the rock—with honey, would I satisfy thee.  

## Psalms 82

1. A Melody of Asaph. God, hath taken his place in the august assembly, In the midst of the gods, will he judge.

2. How long will ye judge perversely, And, the countenances of the lawless, uplift? [Selah.]

3. Vindicate the weak and the fatherless, The oppressed and the poor, see righted;

4. Deliver the weak and the needy, Out of the hand of the lawless, make rescue.

5. They know not, neither can they perceive, In darkness, they wander, All the foundations of the earth do shake. 

6.  I, said, Gods, ye are, Yea, sons of the Highest, are ye all;

7. But indeed, like the earth-born, shall ye die! And, like one of the princes, shall ye fall!

8. Arise! O God, judge thou the earth, For, thou, wilt inherit all the nations.  

## Psalms 83

1. A Song, a Melody of Asaph. O God, Do not keep quiet, Do not hold thy peace, Neither be thou still, O GOD!

2. For lo! thine enemies, are tumultuous, And, they who hate thee, have lifted up the head;

3. Against thy people, they craftily devise a secret plot, And conspire against thy treasured ones.

4. They have said—Come, and let us wipe them out from being a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.

5. For they have taken counsel with one heart, Against thee—a covenant, would they solemnize—

6. The tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagarenes;

7. Gebal and Ammon, and Amalek, The Philistines, with the dwellers in Tyre;

8. Even Assyria hath joined herself with them, They have become an arm to the sons of Lot. [Selah.] 

9.  Make them like Midian, like Sisera, like Jabin, by the torrent of Kishon;

10. They perished at En-dor, They become manure for the soil!

11. Make them—their nobles—like Oreb and like Zeeb, And, like Zebah and like Zalmunna, all their princes:

12. Who said—Let us take a possession for ourselves, The pastures of God!

13. O my God, make them, As whirling [dust], As chaff before a wind;

14. As a fire burneth a forest,—And as a flame setteth mountains ablaze,

15. So, wilt thou pursue them with thy tempest,—And, with thy storm-wind, wilt terrify them:

16. Fill thou their faces with dishonour, That men may seek thy Name, O Yahweh;

17. Let them turn pale, and be terrified to futurity, Yea let them blush, and perish:

18. That men may know that, thou, Whose Name alone is Yahweh, Art Most High over all the earth.  

## Psalms 84

1. To the Chief Musician. On "the Gittith." For the Sons of Korah. A Melody. How lovely are thy habitations, O Yahweh of hosts!

2. My soul, longeth—yea even languisheth—for the courts of Yahweh,—My heart and my flesh, shout aloud for a Living GOD.

3. Even the sparrow, hath found a home, And, the swallow, a nest for herself, where she hath laid her young, Thine altars, O Yahweh of hosts, My king and my God!

4. How happy are they who abide in thy house,—Still are they praising thee. [Selah.]

5. How happy the men whose strength is in thee, Festive processions are in their heart.

6. Passing through the balsam-vale, A place of fountains, they make it, Yea, with blessings, is it covered by the early rain.

7. They go from strength to strength, Each one appeareth before God in Zion. 

8.  O Yahweh, God of hosts, hear thou my prayer,—Give hear, thou God of Jacob. [Selah.]

9. Our Shield, behold thou, O God, And look upon the face of thine Anointed One.

10. For better is a day in thy courts, than a thousand, I choose rather to stand at the threshold in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of lawlessness.

11. For, a sun and shield, is Yahweh God,—Grace and glory, will Yahweh give, He will not withhold what is good, from them who walk without blame.

12. O Yahweh of hosts! How happy the man who trusteth in thee!  

## Psalms 85

1. To the Chief Musician. For the Sons of Korah. A Melody. Thou hast accepted, O Yahweh, thy land, Thou hast brought back the captives of Jacob;

2. Thou hast taken away, the iniquity of thy people, Thou hast covered, all their sin. [Selah.]

3. Thou hast withdrawn all thine indignation, Thou hast ceased from the glow of thine anger.

4. Restore us, O God of our salvation, And take away thy vexation towards us.

5. To times age-abiding, wilt thou be angry with us? Wilt thou prolong thine anger, from generation to generation?

6. Wilt not, thou thyself, again give us life, That, thy people, may rejoice in thee.

7. Show us, O Yahweh, thy lovingkindness, And, thy salvation, wilt thou grant us. 

8.  I will hear, what GOD—Yahweh—will speak,—For he will bespeak prosperity to his people, And to his men of lovingkindness, And to them who return with their heart unto him.

9. Surely, near unto them who revere him, is his salvation, That the Glory, may settle down, in our land.

10. Lovingkindness and faithfulness, have met together, Righteousness and prosperity, have kissed each other;

11. Faithfulness, out of the earth, doth spring forth, And, righteousness, out of the heavens, hath looked down.

12. Yahweh himself too, will give us the blessing, And, our land, shall yield her increase.

13. Righteousness, before him, shall march long,—That he may make, into a way, the steps of its feet.  

## Psalms 86

1. A Prayer. David’s. Bow down, O Yahweh, thine ear—answer me, For, oppressed and needy, am I;

2. O guard my life, For, a man of lovingkindness, am I,—Save thy servant, O thou my God, [Thy servant] who trusteth in thee;

3. Show me favour, O My Lord, For, unto thee, do I cry, all the day;

4. Rejoice the soul of thy servant, For, unto thee, O My Lord, my soul, do I lift.

5. For, thou, O My Lord, art good and forgiving, And abundant in lovingkindness, to all who call upon thee.

6. Give ear, O Yahweh, unto my prayer, And attend unto the voice of my supplications.

7. In the day of my distress, will I call upon thee, For thou wilt answer me. 

8.  There is none like unto thee, among the gods, O My Lord, And nothing like thy works.

9. All nations whom thou hast made, Shall come in and bow down before thee, O My Lord, That they may glorify thy Name.

10. For great thou art, and doest wondrous things, Thou, O God, of thyself alone.

11. Point out to me, O Yahweh, thy way, I will walk steadfastly in thy truth, My heart will rejoice to revere thy Name.

12. I will give thee thanks, Adonay, my God, with all my heart, And will glorify thy Name unto times age-abiding.

13. For, thy lovingkindness, is great towards me, And thou hast rescued my soul from Hades beneath.

14. O God, the insolent, have arisen against me, And, the assembly of tyrants, have sought my life, And have not set thee before them.

15. But, thou, O My Lord, art, A God of compassion and favour, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness a faithfulness.

16. Turn thou unto me, and show me favour,—Give thy strength to thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid.

17. Perform with me a token for good,—That they who hate me may see and be ashamed, In that, thou, Yahweh, hast helped me and comforted me.  

## Psalms 87

1. For the Sons of Korah. A Melody, a Song. His foundation, is in the holy mountains:

2. Yahweh loveth the gates of Zion, More than all the dwellings of Jacob.

3. Glorious things, are to be spoken of thee, O city of God. [Selah.] 

4.  I will mention Rahab and Babylon, to them who know me—Lo! Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia, This one was born there.

5. But, of Zion, it shall be said—This man and that were born in her, And the Highest himself shall establish her.

6. Yahweh, will record, when he enrolleth the peoples, This one was born there. [Selah.]

7. As well the singers as the flute-players [are saying],—All my springs, are in thee!  

## Psalms 88

1. A Song, a Melody. For the Sons of Korah. To the Chief Musician. On "Mahalath." For alternate Song. An Instructive Psalm. By Heman the Ezrahite. O Yahweh, God of my salvation, By day, have I made outcry, In the night, [also] before thee.

2. Let my prayer, come into thy presence, Bow down thine ear to my loud cry.

3. For my soul, is sated with misfortunes, And, my life—unto Hades, hath drawn near;

4. I am counted with them who descend into the pit, I have become as a man that is without help;

5. Among the dead, is my couch,—Like the slain that lie in the grave, Where thou rememberest them no more, Yea, they, from thy hand, are cut off;

6. Thou hast laid me, In the lowest pit, In dark places, In the deeps:

7. Upon me, hath rested thine indignation, And, with all thy breakers, hast thou caused affliction. [Selah.]

8. Thou hast far removed mine acquaintances from me,—Thou hast made me an abomination unto them, Shut up, and I cannot go forth!

9. Mine eye, hath dimmed through affliction; I have called upon thee, O Yahweh, all day long, I have spread out, unto thee, my hands. 

10.  For the dead, wilt thou perform a wonder? Or shall, the shades, arising, give thee thanks? [Selah.]

11. Shall Thy lovingkindness be recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness, in destruction?

12. Shall any wonder of thine, be known in the dark? Or, thy righteousness, in the land of forgetfulness?

13. But, I, unto thee, O Yahweh, have cried for help, And, in the morning, my prayer will confront thee!

14. Wherefore, O Yahweh, shouldst thou reject my soul? shouldst thou hide thy face from me?

15. Afflicted have I been, and dying, from youth, I have borne the terror of thee—I shall be distracted!

16. Over me, have passed thy bursts of burning anger, The alarms of thee have put an end to me;

17. They have surrounded me like waters, all the day, They have come circling against me together:

18. Thou hast far removed from me, lover and friend, Mine acquaintances, are in darkness.  

## Psalms 89

1. An Instructive Psalm, by Ethan the Ezrahite. The lovingkindnesses of Yahweh, age-abidingly will I sing, To generation after generation, will I make known thy faithfulness with my mouth.

2. For I said, To times age-abiding, shall lovingkindness be built up, As for the heavens, thou wilt establish thy faithfulness therein.

3. I have solemnised a covenant, for my chosen one, I have sworn unto David my servant:

4. Unto times age-abiding, will I establish thy seed, And will build up, unto generation after generation, thy throne. [Selah.] 

5.  So shall the heavens praise thy wondrousness, O Yahweh,—Yea, thy faithfulness, in the convocation of holy ones.

6. For whom, in the skies, can one compare unto Yahweh? [Or] can one liken unto Yahweh, among the sons of the mighty?

7. A GOD inspiring awe in the circle of the holy ones, exceedingly, And to be reverenced above all who are round about him.

8. O Yahweh, God of hosts! Who, like thee, is mighty, O Yah! With thy faithfulness round about thee:

9. Thou, rulest over the swelling of the sea, When the rolling waves thereof lift themselves, Thou, dost bid them be still:

10. Thou, hast crushed—as one slain—Rahab, With thy strong arm, hast thou scattered thy foes.

11. Thine, are the heavens, Yea, thine, the earth, The world and the fulness thereof, Thou, didst found them;

12. The north and the south, Thou, didst create them,—Tabor and Hermon, with thy Name, shall shout for joy:

13. Thine is an arm with might, Strong is thy hand, High is thy right hand;

14. Righteousness and justice, are the establishing of thy throne, Lovingkindness and faithfulness, go before thy face. 

15.  How happy are the people who know the joyful sound! O Yahweh! in the light of thy countenance, shall they firmly march along;

16. In thy Name, shall they exult all the day, And, in thy righteousness, shall they be exalted.

17. For, the beauty of their strength, thou art, And, in thine acceptance, shall our horns be exalted.

18. For, to Yahweh, belongeth our Shield, And, to the Holy One of Israel, belongeth our King. 

19.  Then spakest thou in vision of thy men of lovingkindness, and saidst—I have laid help upon a mighty one, I have exalted one chosen from among the people;

20. I have found David my servant, With mine own holy oil, have I anointed him;

21. With whom my hand shall be firm, Yea, mine arm, shall strengthen him;

22. No foe shall make exactions on him, Nor shall, a son of perversity, humiliate him;

23. And I will shatter, from before him, his adversaries, And, them who hate him, will I smite;

24. And, my faithfulness and my lovingkindness, shall be with him, And, in my Name, exalted shall be his horn;

25. And I will set, in the sea, his hand, And, in the rivers, his right hand;

26. He, shall cry out unto me, My Father, thou art, My GOD, and my Rock of Salvation!

27. Yea, I, will appoint him, firstborn, Most High to the kings of the earth!

28. Age-abidingly, will I keep for him my lovingkindness, And, my covenant, hath been made steadfast for him;

29. Therefore will I appoint, to futurity, his seed, And his throne as the days of the heavens.

30. If his sons forsake my law, And, in my regulations, do not walk;

31. If, my statutes, they profane, And, my commandments, do not keep:

32. Then will I punish, with a rod, their transgression; And, with stripes, their iniquity:

33. But, my lovingkindness, will I not frustrate from them, Neither will I falsify my faithfulness;

34. I will not violate my covenant, And that which hath proceeded out of my lips, will I not alter:

35. One thing, have I sworn by my holiness, Verily, to David, will I not lie;

36. His seed, age-abidingly, shall remain, And, his throne, be like the sun before me;

37. Like the moon, shall it be established unto times age-abiding, And, a witness, in the skies, hath been made sure. [Selah.] 

38.  Yet, thou thyself, hast cast off, and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with thine Anointed One!

39. Thou hast cast down the covenant of thy Servant, Thou hast profaned, to the earth, his crown;

40. Thou hast broken down all his defenses, Thou hast laid his fortresses in ruins;

41. All the passers by the way, have plundered him, He hath become a reproach to his neighbours;

42. Thou hast raised the right hand of his adversaries, Thou hast gladdened all his enemies;

43. Yea thou hast turned the edge of his sword, Neither hast thou caused him to stand in the battle;

44. Thou hast brought to an end his splendour, And, his throne—to the ground, hast thou hurled;

45. Thou hast shortened the days of his youths,—Thou hast covered him with shame. [Selah.]

46. How long, O Yahweh, Wilt thou hide thyself utterly? Shall thine indignation, burn like fire?

47. Remember how short-lived, I, am, Wherefore, in vain, hast thou created all the sons of Adam?

48. Who is the man that shall live, and not see death? That can deliver his soul from the hand of hades. [Selah.]

49. Where are thy former lovingkindnesses, O My Lord? Thou didst swear unto David, in thy faithfulness!

50. Remember, O My Lord, the reproach of thy servants, I have carried in my bosom the insult of the peoples:

51. In that thy foes have reproached, O Yahweh, In that they have reproached the footsteps of thine Anointed One!

52. Blessed be Yahweh to times age-abiding, Amen, and Amen!  

## Psalms 90

1. A Prayer by Moses, the Man of God. Lord! a dwelling-place, hast, thou, become to us, From generation to generation:

2. Before, the mountains, were born, Or thou hadst brought forth the earth and the world, Even, from age to age, thou, [wast] GOD.

3. Thou causest man to return unto dust, And hast said—Return, ye sons of Adam!

4. For, a thousand years, in thine eyes, [are], As yesterday, in that it passed away, Or [as] a watch in the night.

5. Thou hast snatched them away, A sleep, do they become, In the morning, [they are] like grass that shooteth up,

6. In the morning, it sprouteth and shooteth up, By the evening, it is cut down and withered. 

7.  For we are consumed in thine anger, And, in thy wrath, are we dismayed;

8. Thou hast set, Our iniquities before thee, Our secret near the luminary of thy face.

9. For, all our days, decline in thy wrath,—We end our years like a sigh.

10. The days of our years, have, in them, three score years and ten, And, if, by reason of strength, they have fourscore years, Yet, their boast, is labour and sorrow, For it hath passed quickly, and we have flown away.

11. Who knoweth the strength of thine anger? Even, according to the fear of thee, is thy wrath! 

12.  How to number our days, so grant us to know, That we may win us a heart that hath wisdom.

13. Return, Yahweh, oh how long? And have compassion upon thy servants;

14. Satisfy us, in the morning, with thy lovingkindness, That we may shout aloud and be glad, Throughout all our days.

15. Make us glad, according to, The days thou hast humbled us, The years we have seen misfortune:

16. Let thy work, appear unto thy servants, And, thy majesty, upon their children;

17. And let the delightfulness of Adonay our God be upon us,—And, the work of our hands, establish thou upon us, Yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it.  

## Psalms 91

1. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, Under the shadow of the Almighty, will tarry,

2. Saying of Yahweh—My refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I will trust.

3. For, he, will rescue thee, From the snare of the fowler, From the destructive pestilence.

4. With his pinion, will he cover thee, And, under his wings, shalt thou seek refuge, A shield and buckler, is his faithfulness.

5. Thou shalt not be afraid, Of the dread of the night, Of the arrow that flieth by day;

6. Of the pestilence that, in darkness, doth walk, Of the plague that layeth waste at noonday.

7. There shall fall, at thy side, a thousand, Yea, myriads, at thy right hand, Unto thee, shall it not come nigh;

8. Save only, with thine own eyes, shalt thou discern, And, the recompense of the lawless, shalt thou see. 

9.  Because, thou, [hast made] Yahweh, my refuge,—The Most High, thou hast made thy dwelling-place,

10. There shall not be sent unto thee misfortune, Nor shall, plague, come near into thy tent;

11. For, his messengers, will he charge concerning thee, To keep thee, in all thy ways;

12. On hands, will they bear thee up, Lest thou strike, against a stone, thy foot;

13. On the lion and adder, shalt thou tread, Shalt trample on young lion and crocodile.

14. Because, on me, he hath set firm his love, Therefore will I deliver him, I will set him on high, Because he hath known my Name;

15. He shall call me, and I will answer him, With him, will, I, be, in distress, I will rescue him, and will honour him;

16. With length of days, will I satisfy him, And will show him my salvation.  

## Psalms 92

1. A Melody, a Song, For the Sabbath-day. It is good to give thanks to Yahweh, And to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most High;

2. To declare, in the morning, thy lovingkindness, And thy faithfulness at night;

3. Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon a harp, With resounding music on the lyre.

4. For thou hast made me glad, O Yahweh, in thy doing, In the works of thy hands, will I shout for joy.

5. How great have grown thy works, Yahweh, [How] very deep are laid thy plans!

6. A man that is brutish, cannot know, And, a dullard, cannot discern this:— 

7.  When the lawless do thrive like grass, And all the workers of iniquity have blossomed, It is that they may be destroyed for ever.

8. But, thou, shalt be on high age-abidingly, O Yahweh.

9. For lo! thine enemies, Yahweh, For lo! thine enemies, shall perish, They shall be scattered—all the workers of iniquity;

10. But thou wilt exalt, as [those of] the buffalo, my horn, I have been anointed, with fresh oil.

11. So hath mine eye descried them who were lying in wait for me,—Of my wicked assailants, mine ears, shall hear.

12. The righteous, like the palm-tree, shall thrive, Like the cedar in Lebanon, shall he grow;

13. They who are planted in the house of Yahweh, In the courts of our God, shall flourish;

14. Still shall they bear fruit in old age, Vigorous and fresh, shall they be:

15. To declare that upright is Yahweh, My Rock, and no perversity in him.  

## Psalms 93

1. Yahweh, hath become king, With majesty, is he clothed,—Clothed is Yahweh, With strength, hath he girded himself, Surely he hath fixed the world, It shall not be shaken.

2. Established hath been thy throne from of old, From age-past times, thou art.

3. The floods have lifted up, O Yahweh, The floods have lifted up—their voice, The floods have lifted up—their dashing waves.

4. With the sounds of many waters, Majestic are the breakers of the sea, Majestic on high, is Yahweh.

5. Thy testimonies, are strongly confirmed, To thy house, befitting is holiness, O Yahweh—to length of days.  

## Psalms 94

1. O GOD of avenging—Yahweh, GOD of avenging, shine forth:

2. Lift up thyself, O judge of the earth, Render a recompense unto the proud.

3. How long shall the lawless, O Yahweh, How long shall the lawless exult?

4. They pour forth [words], they speak arrogantly, All the workers of iniquity, do boast:

5. Thy people, O Yahweh, they will crush, And, thine inheritance, tread down;

6. The widow and sojourner, they will slay, And, the fatherless, murder.

7. Yet have they said—Yah, doth not see, The God of Jacob, doth not understand.

8. Understand, ye brutish among the people, And, ye dullards, when will ye show discretion?

9. He that planteth the ear, shall he not hear? Or, that fashioneth the eye, shall he not have power to see?

10. He that correcteth nations, shall he not reprove? He that teacheth man knowledge!

11. Yahweh, knoweth the plans of men, That, they, are a breath! 

12.  How happy the man whom thou correctest, O Yah! And whom, out of thy law, thou instructest!

13. That thou mayest give him rest from the days of misfortune, Until there be digged—for the lawless one—a pit.

14. For Yahweh, will not abandon, his people, And, his inheritance, will he not forsake;

15. For, unto righteousness, shall the judicial sentence return, Then shall follow it—all the upright in heart.

16. Who will rise up for me, against the evil-doers? Who will make a stand for me, against the workers of iniquity?

17. If, Yahweh, had not been a help to me, Soon had sunk into silence—my soul!

18. If I say, My foot, hath slipped, Thy lovingkindness, O Yahweh, supporteth me.

19. In the multitude of my cares within me, Thy consolations, delight my soul.

20. Shall the throne that inflicteth ruin, have fellowship with thee, That frameth oppression, by statute?

21. They make an attack on the life of the righteous one,—And, innocent blood, they condemn.

22. But, Yahweh, hath become for me a high tower, And my God, my rock of refuge.

23. Thus hath he brought back on them their iniquity, And, by their own wickedness, will he destroy them, Destroy them, will Yahweh our God.  

## Psalms 95

1. Come, let us make a joyful noise to Yahweh, Let us shout in triumph, to the rock of our salvation!

2. O let us come before his face with thanksgiving, With the sounds of strings, let us shout aloud to him.

3. For, a great GOD, is Yahweh, And a great king, above all gods.

4. In whose hand, are the hidden recesses of the earth, And, the peaks of the mountains, are his;

5. Whose, is the sea, for, he, made it, And, the dry land, his hands, did form.

6. Enter! let us bow down, and bend low, Let us kneel, before Yahweh our maker; 

7.  For, he, is our God, And, we, are the people of his pasture, and the flock of his hand? To-day, if, to his voice, ye will hearken,

8. Do not harden your heart as at Meribah, As on the day of Massah, in the desert;

9. When your fathers, tested me, They proved me, yea they also saw what I could do.

10. Forty years, loathed I that generation, So I said—A people going astray in heart, they are, Even they, have not known my ways!

11. And I sware in mine anger,—Verily they shall not enter into my rest.  

## Psalms 96

1. Sing to Yahweh, a song that is new, Sing to Yahweh, all the earth;

2. Sing to Yahweh, bless ye his Name,—Tell the tidings, from day to day, of his salvation:

3. Recount, Among the nations, his glory, Among all the peoples, his wonders.

4. For great is Yahweh, and worthy to be mightily praised, To be revered is he above all gods;

5. For, all the gods of the peoples, are things of nought—But, Yahweh, made, the heavens.

6. Praise and majesty, are before him, Strength and beauty, are in his sanctuary.

7. Give to Yahweh, ye families of the peoples, Give to Yahweh, glory and strength;

8. Give to Yahweh, the glory of his Name, Bring a present, and enter his courts;

9. Bow down to Yahweh, in the adornment of holiness, Be in anguish at his presence, all the earth! 

10.  Say among the nations, Yahweh, hath become King, Surely he hath fixed the world, it shall not be shaken, He will judge the peoples with equity.

11. Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult, Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;

12. Let the field, leap for joy, and all that is therein, Then, shall all the trees of the forest, shout in triumph,

13. Before Yahweh, for he is coming, For he is coming to judge the earth,—He will judge the world, in righteousness, And the peoples, in his faithfulness.  

## Psalms 97

1. Yahweh, hath become king, Let the earth exult, Let the multitude of coastlands rejoice.

2. Clouds and thick darkness, are round about him, Righteousness and justice, are the establishing of his throne.

3. Fire, before him, proceedeth, That it may consume, round about, his adversaries.

4. His lightnings, have illumined, the world, The earth, hath seen, and hath trembled;

5. The mountains, like wax, have melted, At the presence of Yahweh, At the presence, of the Lord of all the earth.

6. The heavens, have declared, his righteousness,—And all the peoples, have seen, his glory.

7. Let all who serve an image, be ashamed, They who boast themselves in things of nought, Bow down unto him, all ye gods. 

8.  Zion, hath heard and rejoiced, And the daughters of Judah, have exulted, Because of thy righteous decisions, O Yahweh:

9. For, thou, Yahweh, art Most High over all the earth, Greatly hast thou exalted thyself above all gods.

10. Ye lovers of Yahweh! be haters of wrong,—He preserveth the lives of his men of lovingkindness, From the hand of the lawless, will he rescue them.

11. Light, is sown for the righteous one, And, for the upright in heart, rejoicing:

12. Rejoice, ye righteous, in Yahweh, And give ye thanks, at the mention of his holiness.  

## Psalms 98

1. A Melody. Sing to Yahweh, a song that is new, For, wonderful things, hath he done, His own right hand and his holy arm, have brought him salvation.

2. Yahweh, hath made known, his salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, hath he revealed his righteousness;

3. He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness towards the house of Israel,—All the ends of the earth, have seen, the salvation of our God. 

4.  Shout aloud to Yahweh, all the earth, Break forth and make a joyful noise and sweep the strings;

5. Sweep the strings to Yahweh, With the lyre, With the lyre, and the voice of melody;

6. With trumpets and the sound of a horn, Shout aloud, before the king—Yahweh.

7. Let the sea, roar, and the fulness thereof, The world, and they who dwell therein;

8. Let, the floods, clap their hands, Together, let, the mountains, make a joyful noise,

9. Before Yahweh, for he is coming—to judge the earth,—He will judge the world, in righteousness, And the peoples, with equity.  

## Psalms 99

1. Yahweh, hath become king, Let the peoples, tremble, He is enthroned on the cherubim, Let the earth, shake.

2. Yahweh, in Zion, is great, And, high, is he over all the peoples.

3. Let them thank his Name—great and reverend, Holy, is he!

4. Yea, with the strength of a king—justice, he loveth,—Thou, hast established equity, Justice and righteousness in Jacob, thou, hast wrought.

5. Exalt Yahweh our God, And bow down at his footstool, Holy, is he! 

6.  Moses and Aaron, [were] among his priests, And, Samuel, [was] among them who were calling upon his Name, Who were calling upon Yahweh, and, he, used to answer them:

7. In the pillar of cloud, used he to speak unto them, They kept his testimonies, and the statute he gave them.

8. O Yahweh our God! thou, answeredst them,—A pardoning GOD, thou becamest to them, Yet one bringing vengeance on their deeds.

9. Exalt Yahweh our God, And bow down towards his holy mountain, For, holy, is Yahweh our God.  

## Psalms 100

1. A Melody for Thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth:

2. Serve Yahweh with rejoicing, Enter before him, with shouts of triumph.

3. Know that, Yahweh, he, is God,—He, made us, and not, we ourselves, His people, and the flock of his pasture.

4. Enter ye his gates, with thanksgiving, his courts, with praise, Give ye thanks to him, bless ye his Name;

5. For good is Yahweh, Age-abiding is his lovingkindness, And, unto generation after generation, his faithfulness.  

## Psalms 101

1. David’s. A Melody. Of lovingkindness and of justice, will I sing! Unto thee, O Yahweh, will I touch the strings!

2. I will behave myself wisely in a blameless way, When wilt thou come in unto me? I will walk to and fro in the blamelessness of my heart,—in the midst of my house:

3. I will not set before mine eyes, a vile thing,—The doing of them who fall away, I hate, It shall not cleave unto me;

4. A perverse heart, shall depart from me, A maker of mischief, will I not acknowledge;

5. He that uttereth slander in secret against his friend, him, will I root out; One of lofty eyes, and of an ambitious heart, him shall I not be able to endure.

6. Mine eyes, shall be upon the faithful of the land, That they may dwell with me,—he that walketh in a blameless way, he, shall attend me.

7. There shall not dwell in the midst of my house, One who worketh deceit,—he that speaketh falsehoods, shall not be established before mine eyes;

8. Morning by morning, will I uproot, All the lawless ones of the land, That I may cut off, out of the city of Yahweh—All the workers of iniquity.  

## Psalms 102

1. A Prayer for the Humbled One when he is about to faint, and, before Yahweh, poureth out his grief. O Yahweh, hear thou my prayer, and let, my cry for help, unto thee, enter in.

2. Do not hide thy face from me, In the day when I am in distress,—Bend down unto me thine ear, In the day when I call, speedily answer me.

3. For, consumed in smoke, are my days, And, my bones, like a burning mass, are scorched through;

4. Smitten like herbage, so is my heart dried up, For I have forgotten to eat my food.

5. At the noise of my groaning, my bone, hath cleaved, to my flesh:

6. I am like the pelican of the desert, I have become as an owl among ruins.

7. I have watched and am become, Like a bird sitting alone upon a housetop.

8. All the day, have mine enemies, reproached me, And, they who are mad against me, by me, have sworn.

9. For, ashes—like bread, have I eaten, And, my drink—with my tears, have I mingled;

10. Because of thine indignation and thy wrath, For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.

11. My days, are like a shadow extended, And, I, as green herbage, do wither. 

12.  But, thou, O Yahweh, age-abidingly wilt remain, And the memorial of thee, to generation after generation.

13. Thou, wilt arise, wilt have compassion upon Zion, Surely it is time to favour her, Surely the time appointed, hath come;

14. Seeing that thy servants, take pleasure, in her stones, And, her dust, they favour:

15. That the nations may revere thy Name, O Yahweh, And all the kings of the earth, thy glory.

16. When Yahweh, hath built up, Zion, Hath appeared in his glory;

17. Hath turned towards the prayer of the destitute, And not despised their prayer,

18. This, shall be written, for a later generation, And, a people to be created, will give praise unto Yah:—

19. That he looked down, out of his holy height, Yahweh, from the heavens unto the earth, directed his gaze;—

20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To set free, them who were appointed to death.

21. To the end the Name of Yahweh, might be celebrated in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem:

22. When the peoples, gather themselves together, And the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh. 

23.  He hath prostrated, in the way, my strength,—He hath shortened my days.

24. I said, O my GOD, do not remove me in the midst of my days, Throughout the generation of generations, are thy years;

25. Of old—the earth, thou didst found, And, the work of thy hands, are the heavens;

26. They, shall perish, But, thou, wilt abide; And, they all, like a garment, shall fall in pieces, As a vesture, wilt thou change them and they shall vanish;

27. But, thou, art, the same,—And, thy years, shall have no end:

28. The children of thy servants, shall continue,—And, their seed, before thee, be established.  

## Psalms 103

1. Bless, O my soul, Yahweh,—And all that is within me, his holy Name;

2. Bless, O my soul, Yahweh, And forget not all his dealings:—

3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquity, Who healeth all thy diseases;

4. Who redeemeth, from destruction, thy life, Who crowneth thee, with lovingkindness and compassion:

5. Who satisfieth, with good, thine age, Thy youth, reneweth itself like an eagle. 

6.  Yahweh is one, who executeth righteousness, Yea vindication for all the oppressed.

7. Who made known his ways unto Moses, unto the sons of Israel, his doings.

8. Compassionate and gracious, is Yahweh,—Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness.

9. Not perpetually, will he contend, Nor age-abidingly, retain anger;

10. Not according to our sins, hath he dealt with us, Nor according to our iniquities, hath he treated us.

11. For, as the heavens are exalted over the earth, His lovingkindness hath prevailed over them who revere him;

12. As far as East from West, Hath he put far from us, our transgressions;

13. Like the compassion of a father for his children, Is, the compassion of Yahweh, for them who revere him;

14. For, he, knoweth how we are formed, He is mindful that, dust, we are.

15. As for man, like grass, are his days, Like the blossom of the field, so, doth he blossom;

16. For, a wind, hath passed over it, and it is gone, And its own place is acquainted with it no more.

17. But, the lovingkindness of Yahweh, is from one age even to another, Upon them who revere him, And his righteousness, to children’s children:—

18. To such as keep his covenant, And remember his precepts, to do them. 

19.  Yahweh, in the heavens, hath established his throne, And, his kingdom, over all, hath dominion.

20. Bless Yahweh, ye messengers of his,—Heroes of vigour, doing his word, To hearken [again] to the voice of his word;

21. Bless Yahweh, all ye his hosts, Attendants of his, doing his pleasure;

22. Bless Yahweh, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion, Bless, O my soul, Yahweh.  

## Psalms 104

1. Bless, O my soul, Yahweh,—Yahweh, my God, thou art exceedingly great, With honour and majesty, hast thou clothed thyself,

2. Putting on light, as a robe, Stretching out the heavens, as a curtain;

3. Building, in the waters, his upper chambers,—Who maketh clouds his chariot, Who passeth along on the wings of the wind;

4. Making His messengers, winds, His attendants, a flaming fire;

5. He hath fixed the earth on its foundations, It is not to be shaken, to times age-abiding and beyond.

6. With the resounding deep—as a garment, hast thou covered it, Above the mountains, stand the waters;

7. At thy rebuke, they flee, At the voice of thy thunder, they hurry away;

8. Mountains rise, Valleys sink, Unto the place which thou hast fixed for them;

9. Bounds, hast thou set, which they are not to pass over, They are not to return to cover the earth. 

10.  Who hast sent forth springs, through the torrent-beds, Between the mountains, they flow along;

11. They give drink, to every wild beast of the field, The wild asses do break their thirst.

12. Over them, the bird of the heavens settleth down, From amidst the foliage, they utter a voice.

13. Who watereth the mountains out of his upper chambers, Out of the fruit of thy works, thou satisfiest the earth.

14. Who causeth the grass to shoot forth for the cattle, And the herb, for the service of man, That he may bring forth food out of the earth;

15. And, wine, may rejoice the heart of man, Making radiant his well-nourished face,—And, food, may, the heart of man, sustain.

16. Satisfied are, The trees of Yahweh, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

17. Where the birds build their nests, The stork, in the fir-trees, hath her house;

18. The high mountains, are for the chamois, The crags, are a refuge for the conies. 

19.  He hath made the moon for seasons, And, the sun, knoweth his place for entering in.

20. Thou causest darkness, and it becometh night, Therein, creepeth forth, Every wild beast of the forest;

21. The young lions, roaring for prey, And seeking, from GOD, their food.

22. The sun ariseth, they withdraw themselves, And, in their lairs, lay them down.

23. Man goeth forth to his work, And to his labour, until evening.

24. How thy works abound, O Yahweh! All of them—in wisdom, hast thou made, The earth is full of thy possession:—

25. This sea here, is great and broad on both hands,—Wherein are creeping things, even without number, Living things, small with great;

26. There, ships, sail along, This sea-monster, thou hast formed to sport therein;

27. All of them, for thee, do wait, That thou mayest give them their food in its season;

28. Thou givest unto them, they gather, Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.

29. Thou hidest thy face, they are dismayed, Thou withdrawest their spirit, They cease to breathe, And, unto their own dust, do they return:

30. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created, And thou renewest the face of the ground. 

31.  Be thy glory, O Yahweh, to times age-abiding, Let Yahweh rejoice in his own works:

32. Who looketh at the earth, and it trembleth, He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.

33. I will sing to Yahweh, as long as I live! Yea I will touch the strings to my God, while I continue;

34. Pleasing unto him, be my meditation, I, will rejoice in Yahweh.

35. Sinners shall be consumed out of the earth And, the lawless, no more, shall exist,—Bless, O my soul, Yahweh, Praise ye Yah!  

## Psalms 105

1. Give ye thanks to Yahweh, Call upon his Name, Make known, among the peoples, his doings;

2. Sing ye to him, Make ye music to him, Speak ye of all his wonders.

3. Make your boast in his holy Name, Joyful be the heart of them who are seeking Yahweh.

4. Search out Yahweh and his strength, Seek diligently his face at all times.

5. Remember his wonders which he hath done, His portents, and the just decisions of his mouth.

6. O ye Seed of Abraham—his servants, Sons of Jacob—his chosen ones:

7. Yahweh himself, is our God, Through all the land, are his just decision. 

8.  He hath remembered, unto times age-abiding, his covenant, The word he commanded, to a thousand generations;

9. Which he solemnised with Abraham, and his oath, to Isaac;

10. And confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel, as a covenant age-abiding;

11. Saying, To thee, will I give the land of Canaan, As your inherited portion;

12. While as yet they were men easily counted,—A very few, and sojourners therein;

13. And they wandered from nation to nation, From a kingdom, to another people.

14. He suffered no son of earth to oppress them, And reproved—for their sakes—[even] kings!

15. Ye may not touch mine Anointed ones, And, to my Prophets, may ye do no wrong.

16. Then called he a famine over the land, All the staff of bread, he brake;

17. He sent before them a man, For a slave, was he sold—[even] Joseph;

18. They forced, into a fetter, his foot, Into the iron, entered his soul;

19. Until the time when his word came to pass, Speech of Yahweh, proved him;

20. The king sent, and set him free, One having dominion over peoples, yet loosed he his bonds;

21. He appointed him lord to his household, And one having dominion over all he possessed;

22. That he might bind his rulers as he pleased, And, his elders, he might embue with wisdom.

23. So Israel came into Egypt, And, Jacob, sojourned in the land of Ham;

24. And he made his people exceeding fruitful,—And caused them to become stronger than their adversaries. 

25.  He let them turn their heart—To hate his people, To deal treacherously with his servants;

26. He sent Moses his servant, Aaron, whom he had chosen.

27. He set among them his threatening signs, And his wonders, in the land of Ham;

28. He sent darkness, and made it dark, But they rebelled against his words;

29. He turned their waters into blood, And so caused their fish to die;

30. Their land swarmed with frogs, In the chambers of their kings!

31. He spake, and there came in the gad-fly, Gnats, in all their bounds;

32. He made their showers—hail, A fire flaming throughout their land;

33. And he smote their vines, and their fig-trees, And brake in pieces the trees of their bounds;

34. He spake—then came the swarming locust,—The devouring locust, and that without number;

35. And devoured all the herbage in their land, And devoured the fruit of their ground.

36. Then smote he every firstborn in their land, The beginning of all their strength;

37. Thus brought he them forth, with silver and gold, Nor was there, throughout his tribes, one that faltered;

38. Egypt rejoiced when they went out, For the dread of them had fallen upon them.

39. He spread out a cloud as a covering, And fire, to give light by night,

40. They asked, and he brought in the quail,—And, with the bread of the heavens, he satisfied them;

41. He opened the rock, and there gushed forth waters, They flowed along, through parched places, as a river;

42. For he remembered his holy word, With Abraham his servant.

43. Thus brought he forth his people with gladness,—With shouts of triumph, his chosen ones;

44. And gave them, the lands of the nations, And, of the toil of the peoples, took they possession:

45. In order that they might observe his statutes, And, over his laws, might keep watch, Praise ye Yah.  

## Psalms 106

1. Praise ye Yah, Give ye thanks to Yahweh—For he is good, For age-abiding, is his lovingkindness.

2. Who can relate the mighty deeds of Yahweh? can cause to be heard, all his praise?

3. How happy! They who observe justice, He that executeth righteousness at all times.

4. Remember me, O Yahweh, when thou acceptest thy people, Visit me, with thy salvation;

5. That I may look upon the welfare of thy chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, That I may glory, with thine inheritance. 

6.  We have sinned—with our fathers, We have acted perversely, we have committed lawlessness;

7. Our fathers, in Egypt, understood not thy wonders, They remembered not the abounding of thy lovingkindnesses, but rebelled by the sea—at the Red Sea.

8. Yet he saved them, for the sake of his Name, to make known his mighty power;

9. So he rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up, And he led them through deeps, as pasture-land;

10. And saved them from the hand of one full of hatred, And redeemed them out of the hand of the foe;

11. So the waters covered their adversaries, Not one from among them, was left.

12. They believed therefore in his words, They sang his praise. 

13.  Soon forgat they his works,—They waited not for his counsel;

14. But lusted a lust in the desert, and tested GOD in the waste.

15. So he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.

16. And they became jealous of Moses in the camp,—of Aaron the holy one of Yahweh;

17. The earth opened and engulfed Dathan, and covered up the assembly of Abiram;

18. Then was kindled a fire in their assembly,—a flame, consumed the lawless ones.

19. They made a calf in Horeb,—and bowed down to a molten image;

20. Thus changed they my glory, for the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.

21. They forgat GOD their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt:

22. Wonders in the land of Ham, Terrible things by the Red Sea.

23. Then would he have bidden to destroy them,—had not Moses his chosen, stood in the breach before him, To turn back his wrath from destroying.

24. And they refused the delightful land, They believed not his word;

25. But murmured in their tents,—They hearkened not unto the voice of Yahweh.

26. So he lifted up his hand unto them, that he would let them fall in the desert;

27. And would disperse their seed among the nations, and would scatter them throughout the lands.

28. Yet they let themselves be bound to Baal-peor,—and did eat sacrifices to the dead:

29. So they provoked to anger by their doings, and a plague, made a breach among them.

30. Then stood up Phinehas, and interposed, and stayed was the plague:

31. So it was counted unto him, for righteousness, To generation after generation, unto times age abiding.

32. And they provoked by the waters of Meribah,—And it fared ill with Moses, for their sakes;

33. For they embittered his spirit, and he spake rashly with his lips. 

34.  They destroyed not the peoples of which Yahweh had spoken to them;

35. But had fellowship with the nations, and learned their doings;

36. Yea they served their idols, and they became to them a snare:

37. Yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to mischievous demons;

38. And poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, And the land was polluted with blood-shed;

39. And they became unclean by their works, and became unchaste in their doings.

40. Then was kindled the anger of Yahweh with his people, and he abhorred his own inheritance.

41. So he delivered them up into the hand of the nations, And they who hated them, had dominion over them;

42. And their enemies oppressed them, And they were bowed down under their hand.

43. Many times, did he rescue them,—But, they, rebelled by their counsel, and sank low in their iniquity.

44. Then looked he on the distress which befell them,—when he heard their loud cry;

45. Then remembered he, for them, his covenant, and was moved to pity, according to the abounding of his lovingkindnesses;

46. And granted them compassion before all their captors.

47. Save us, O Yahweh our God, and gather us from among the nations, That we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, That we may triumph aloud in thy praise.

48. Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, from one age even unto another, And all the people, shall say, Amen! Praise ye Yah!  

## Psalms 107

1. O give thanks to Yahweh—For he is good, For, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness.

2. Let the redeemed of Yahweh say, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;

3. And, out of the lands, hath gathered them—From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.

4. They wandered about in the desert—in a waste, Way to a city to dwell in, found they none;

5. Hungry—yea thirsty, their soul, within them, fainted:

6. Then made they outcry to Yahweh, in their peril, Out of their distresses, he rescued them;

7. And led them by a straight road, That they might journey to a city to dwell in.

8. Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men;

9. For he hath satisfied the longing soul, and, the famished soul, hath he filled with good. 

10.  The dwellers in darkness and death-shade, bound with oppression and iron;

11. Because they had rebelled against the sayings of GOD,—and, the counsel of the Most High, they had spurned;

12. And he bowed down, with labour, their heart, They staggered, with no one to help,

13. Then made they outcry to Yahweh in their peril, Out of their distresses, he saved them;

14. He brought them forth out of darkness and death-shade, and, their fetters, he tare off.

15. Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men!

16. For he brake in pieces the doors of bronze, And, the bars of iron, he hewed asunder. 

17.  The perverse, by reason of their transgression, and on account of their iniquities, are afflicted;

18. All manner of food, their soul abhorreth, and so they draw near unto the gates of death,

19. Then make they outcry to Yahweh in their peril, and, out of their distresses, he saveth them.

20. He sendeth his word, and healeth them, and delivereth them from their graves.

21. Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men!

22. Yea let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and recount his works with a shout. 

23.  Men who go down to the sea, in ships, doing business through mighty waters;

24. They, see the works of Yahweh, and his wonders in the deep;

25. And he speaketh, and there ariseth a tempestuous wind, which lifteth on high its rolling waves;

26. They mount the heavens, they descend the roaring deeps, their soul, by trouble, dissolveth;

27. They reel and stagger, like a drunken man, and, all their wisdom, is engulfed,

28. Then make they outcry to Yahweh in their peril, and, out of their distresses, he bringeth them forth,

29. He calmeth the storm to a whisper, and silent are their rolling waves:

30. Then are they glad, because they are hushed, And he guideth them unto their desired haven.

31. Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful dealings with the sons of men!

32. Yea let them extol him in the convocation of the people, and, in the seated company of elders, let them praise him. 

33.  He turneth Rivers into a desert, and, Springs of Water, into thirsty ground,

34. A Land of Fruit, into a waste of salt, For the wickedness of them who dwell therein.

35. He turneth A Desert, into a pool of water, and, A Parched Land into springs of water;

36. And hath caused the famished to dwell there, And they have built them a city to dwell in;

37. And have sown fields, and planted vineyards, and made them fruits of increase:

38. Thus hath he blessed them, and they have multiplied greatly, And, their cattle, he maketh not few.

39. So have they become few and been brought low, By oppression, misfortune, and sorrow;

40. He poureth contempt upon nobles, and causeth them to wander in a pathless waste;

41. But he hath set the needy on high from affliction, and made families, like a flock:—

42. The upright seeth and is glad, And, all perverseness, hath closed her mouth.

43. Who is wise? then let him observe these things! and diligently consider the lovingkindness of Yahweh.  

## Psalms 108

1. A Song, a Melody: David’s. Fixed, is my heart, O God, I will sing and touch the strings, even mine honour.

2. Awake, O harp and lyre, I will awaken the dawn!

3. I will thank thee among the peoples, O Yahweh, and will sing praise unto thee, among the tribes of men.

4. For, great, above the heavens, is thy lovingkindness, and, as far as the skies, thy faithfulness.

5. Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And, above all the earth, be thy glory. 

6.  To the end thy beloved ones may be delivered, Oh save thou with thy right hand and answer me!

7. God, hath spoken in his holiness, I will exult! I will apportion Shechem! And, the Vale of Succoth, will I measure out;

8. Mine, is Gilead—mine, Manasseh, but, Ephraim, is the defence of my head, Judah, is my commander’s staff;

9. Moab, is my wash-bowl, Upon Edom, will I throw my shoe, Over Philistia, raise a shout of triumph.

10. Who will conduct me to a fortified city? Who will lead me as far as Edom?

11. Hast not thou, O God, rejected us? and wilt not go forth, O God, with our hosts.

12. Grant us help out of distress, for, vain, is the deliverance of man:

13. In God, shall we do valiantly, He himself, therefore, shall tread down our adversaries.  

## Psalms 109

1. To the Chief Musician. David’s. A Melody. O God of my praise, do not be silent;

2. For, the mouth of the lawless one and the mouth of the deceiver, against me, are open, They have spoken to me with false tongue;

3. And, with words of hatred, have they surrounded me, and have made war upon me without cause:

4. For my love, they have been accusing me, while, I, was at prayer:

5. Yea they have returned unto me—Evil for good; and, Hatred for my love. 

6.  Set in charge over him, one who is lawless, and let, an accuser, stand at his right hand;

7. When he is judged, let him go out condemned, and let, his own petition, become a sin;

8. Let his days become few, his overseership, let another take;

9. Let his children become fatherless, and his wife a widow;

10. Let his children, wander about, and beg, Let them be driven out of their ruins;

11. Let the creditor take aim at all that he hath, and let strangers prey on the fruit of his toil;

12. Let him have no one to continue lovingkindness, and there be none to favour his fatherless children;

13. Let his posterity be for cutting off, In another generation, let their name be wiped out;

14. Remembered be the iniquity of his fathers against Yahweh, and, the sin of his mother, let it not be wiped out;

15. Let them be before Yahweh continually, and let the memory of them, be cut off out of the earth.

16. Because that he remembered not to show lovingkindness, but pursued the man that was oppressed and needy, that, the downhearted, he might slay.

17. Because he loved cursing, May it have come upon him, Because he delighted not in blessing, May it have kept far from him;

18. Because he clothed himself in cursing as his outer garment, therefore may it have entered like water into his inward part, and like oil into his bones;

19. Be it his, as a garment he shall wrap round him, and for a girdle he shall, at all times, gird on:

20. This, be the reward of mine accusers, from Yahweh, even of them who are speaking wrongfully against my life. 

21.  But, thou, Yahweh, Adonay, deal effectually with me, for the sake of thy Name, Since good is thy lovingkindness, O rescue me;

22. For, oppressed and needy, I am, and, my heart, is wounded within me.

23. As a shadow when it stretcheth out, I am gone, I am shaken off like the locust;

24. My knees, tremble from fasting, and, my flesh, faileth of fatness:

25. So, I, am become a reproach for them, They see me, they shake their head.

26. Help me! O Yahweh my God, Save me, according to thy lovingkindness:

27. That they may know that, Thine own hand, this is, Thou, Yahweh, hast done it.

28. They, may curse if, thou, wilt bless,—Mine assailants, shall be ashamed, but, thy servant, shall rejoice;

29. Mine accusers shall be clothed with confusion, and shall wrap about them, like a cloak, their own shame.

30. I will thank Yahweh loudly with my mouth, Yea, in the midst of multitudes, will I praise him;

31. Because he standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save, from them who would pass sentence on his life.  

## Psalms 110

1. David’s. A Melody. The declaration of Yahweh to my Lord—Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

2. Thy sceptre of strength, will Yahweh extend out of Zion, Tread thou down, in the midst of thy foes.

3. Thy people, will freely offer themselves, in the day of thine army,—in the splendours of holiness, out of the womb of the dawn, To thee, [shall spring forth] the dew of thy youth.

4. Yahweh, hath sworn—and will not repent, Thou, [shalt be] a priest unto times age-abiding, after the manner of Melchizedek. 

5.  My Lord, on thy right hand,—hath shattered—in the day of his anger—kings;

6. He will judge among the nations—full of dead bodies! He hath shattered the head over a land far extended:

7. Of the torrent in the way, will he drink;—For this cause, will he lift up [his] head.

4. Risen—in darkness, is light to the upright, The gracious and compassionate and righteous.

5. Well for a man showing favour and lending! He shall sustain his affairs with justice. 

6.  Surely, unto times age-abiding, shall he not be shaken, In remembrance, age-abiding, shall the righteous one remain;

7. Of evil tidings, shall he not be afraid, Established is his heart, led to trust in Yahweh;

8. Upheld is his heart, he shall not be afraid, until that he gazeth on his foes.

9. He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy, His righteousness, standeth for aye, His horn, shall be exalted in honour.

4. High above all nations, is Yahweh, Above the heavens, his glory.

5. Who is like Yahweh our God? that goeth on high to dwell,

6. That cometh down low to look, through the heavens and through the earth;

7. That raiseth, out of the dust, the poor, From the dunghill, uplifteth the needy;

8. To give a seat with nobles, with the nobles of his people!

9. Causing the barren woman to dwell in a household, A mother of sons in her joy! Praise ye Yah.  

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel came forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from among a people of strange tongue,

2. Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his realm:

3. The sea, beheld, and fled, The Jordan, turned back;

4. The mountains, started like rams, The hills like the young of the flock?

5. What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, that thou turnest back?

6. Ye mountains, that ye start like rams? Ye hills, like the young of the flock?

4. Their idols, are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men,—

5. A mouth, have they, but they speak not, Eyes, have they, but they see not;

6. Ears, have they, but they hear not, A nose, have they, but they smell not:

14. My vows—to Yahweh, will I pay, Might it be in presence of all his people!

15. Costly in the eyes of Yahweh, is, death, for his men of lovingkindness.

16. I beseech thee, O Yahweh—for, I, am thy servant,—I, am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid, Thou hast loosened my bonds.

17. To thee, will I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and, on the Name of Yahweh, will I call:

11. They have compassed me about—yea compassed me about, In the Name of Yahweh, surely I will make them be circumcised;

12. They have compassed me about like wax bees, they have blazed up like the fire of thorns, In the Name of Yahweh, surely I will make them be circumcised.

171.  My lips, shall pour out, praise, When thou shalt teach me thy statutes. 

172.  My tongue, shall respond, with thy word, For, all thy commandments, are righteous. 

173.  Be thy hand ready to help me, For, thy statutes, have I chosen.

174. I have longed for thy salvation, O Yahweh, and, thy law, is my dear delight.

4. The arrows of the hero sharpened, with burning coals of broom. 

5.  Woe is me, That I sojourn in Meshek,—That I abide near the tents of Kedar!

4. Whither have come up the tribes, The tribes of Yah, A testimony to Israel, To give thanks unto the Name of Yahweh:

5. For there are set—Thrones for justice, Thrones for the house David.

4. Then, the waters, had whelmed us, the torrent, gone over our soul;

5. Then, had gone over our soul the waters so proud!

3. Lo! an inheritance from Yahweh, are children, A reward, the fruit of the womb:

4. As arrows in the hand of a warrior, so, are the children of young men.

4. Yahweh, is righteous, He hath cut asunder the cords of the lawless. 

5.  Let all who hate Zion, be ashamed and shrink back:

6. Let them become like the grass of housetops, which, before it is pulled up, hath withered;

7. Wherewith no reaper, hath filled his hand, nor binder, his bosom:

## Psalms 130

1. A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths, have I cried unto thee, O Yahweh.

4. But, with thee, is forgiveness, that thou mayest be revered. 

5.  I have waited for Yahweh, My soul hath waited for his word;

6. I have hoped, O my soul, for My Lord, more than they who watch for the morning, who watch for the morning.

7. Wait, O Israel, for Yahweh,—for, with Yahweh, is lovingkindness, and there aboundeth with him—redemption.

8. He, therefore, will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.  

## Psalms 131

3. Wait, O Israel, for Yahweh, from this time forth, even to times age-abiding.  

## Psalms 132

1. A Song of Ascents. Remember, O Yahweh, unto David, all his humiliations!

2. What he Sware to Yahweh,—Vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

3. Surely I will not enter the home of my own house, nor ascend my curtained couch;

4. I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor, to mine eye-lashes, slumber:

5. Until I find a place for Yahweh, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob.

6. Lo! we heard of it at Ephrathah, we found it in the fields of the wood.

7. We would enter his habitations, we would bow down at his footstool.

8. Arise! O Yahweh, unto thy place of rest, Thou, and the ark of thy strength.

9. Thy priests, let them be clothed with righteousness, Thy men of lovingkindness, let them shout for joy!

10. For the sake of David thy servant, do not turn away the face of thine Anointed One. 

11.  Yahweh hath sworn unto David, in faithfulness, will he not turn from it,—Of the fruit of thy body, will I seat on thy throne.

12. If thy sons keep my covenant, and my testimony which I will teach them, even their sons, unto futurity, shall sit on thy throne.

13. For Yahweh hath chosen Zion,—He hath desired it as a dwelling for himself:

14. This, is my place of rest unto futurity, Here, will I dwell, for I have desired it;

15. Her provision, will I abundantly bless, Her needy ones, will I satisfy with bread;

16. And, her priests, will I clothe with salvation, and, her men of lovingkindness, shall, shout aloud, for joy;

17. There, will I cause to bud a horn to David, I have prepared a lamp for mine Anointed One;

18. His enemies, will I clothe with shame, but, upon himself, shall his crown be resplendent.  

## Psalms 133

1. A Song of Ascents. David’s. Lo! how good and how delightful, for brethren, to dwell together even as one.

2. Like the precious oil upon the head, descending upon the beard; the beard of Aaron,—which descended unto the opening of his robe:

7. Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth,—Lightnings for the rain, hath he made, bringing forth wind out of his treasuries.

8. Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man, and of beast;

9. Sent signs and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

10. Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings:

11. Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;

12. And gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people.

13. O Yahweh! thy Name, is age-abiding,—O Yahweh! thy memorial, is to generation after generation.

14. For Yahweh will vindicate his people,—and, on his servants, have compassion. 

15.  The idols of the nations, are silver and gold, the work of the hands of men:

16. A mouth, have they, but they speak not, Eyes, have they, but they see not;

17. Ears, have they, but they hear not, Nose,—there is no breath in their mouth.

18. Like unto them, shall be they who make them, every one who trusteth in them.

19. O house of Israel! bless Yahweh, O house of Aaron! bless Yahweh;

2. Upon the willows—in the midst thereof, hanged we our lyres:

4. How shall we sing the song of Yahweh, on a foreign soil?

5. If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right-hand forget:

6. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember thee! if I do not lift up Jerusalem above the head of mine own gladness.

4. All the kings of the earth, will thank thee, O Yahweh, when they have heard the sayings of thy mouth;

5. And they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, That great is the glory of Yahweh:

7. Though I walk in the midst of distress, thou wilt give me life,—Because of the anger of my foes, thou wilt thrust forth thy hand, and thy right hand, will save me:

## Psalms 139

1. To the Chief Musician, David’s. A Melody. O Yahweh! thou hast searched me, and observed:

2. Thou, hast observed my downsitting and mine uprising, Thou hast given heed to my desire, from afar:

3. My path and my couch, hast thou examined, and, all my ways, thou well knowest.

4. Surely there hath not been a word on my tongue, [but] behold! O Yahweh, thou hast observed it on every side.

5. Behind and before, hast thou shut me in, and hast laid upon me thy hand:—

6. Knowledge, too wonderful, for me! high, I cannot attain to it! 

7.  Whither can I go from thy spirit? or whither, from thy face, can I flee?

8. If I ascend the heavens, there, thou art! If I spread out hades as my couch, behold thee!

9. If I mount the wings of the dawn, settle down in the region beyond the sea,

10. Even there, thy hand shall lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

11. If I say, Surely, darkness, shall cover me! then, night, is light about me.

12. Even darkness, will not conceal from thee,—but, night, like day, will shine, So is the darkness, as the light!

13. For, thou, didst possess thyself of my reins, thou didst weave me together in the womb of my mother.

14. I thank thee, in that fearfully was my being distinguished, Wonderful are thy works, and, mine own soul, is observing [them] intently!

15. My substance was not hid from thee,—when I was made in secret, when I was skilfully figured in the lower parts of the earth.

16. Mine unfinished substance, thine eyes beheld, and, in thy book, all the parts thereof were written,—the days they should be fashioned! while yet there was not one among them. 

17.  To me, then, how precious have thy desires become, O GOD! How numerous, the heads of them!

18. I would recount them! Beyond the sands, they multiply, I rouse myself—and am still with thee.

19. Wilt thou not, O GOD, slay the lawless one? Therefore, ye men of bloodshed, depart from me!

20. For they speak of thee wickedly, Thy foes lift up [their hand] unto falsehood.

21. Do I not hate, them who hate thee, O Yahweh? And loathe, them who rise up against thee?

22. With completeness of hatred, I hate them, As enemies, have they become to me.

23. Search me, O GOD, and observe my heart, Try me, and observe my cares;

24. And see if there be any idol-way in me, and lead me in a way age-abiding.  

## Psalms 140

1. To the Chief Musician. A Melody of David. Rescue me, O Yahweh, from the men of mischief, From the men of violence, wilt thou preserve me:

2. Who have devised mischiefs in their [heart], Every day, do they stir up wars:

3. They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent,—The poison of the asp, is under their lips. [Selah.]

4. Keep me, O Yahweh, from the hands of the lawless one, From the man of violence, wilt thou preserve me,—who have devised, to thrust at my steps:

5. The proud have hidden a snare for me, and, cords, have they spread as a net beside the track, Snares, have they set for me. [Selah.]

6. I have said unto Yahweh, My GOD, thou art! Give ear, O Yahweh, unto the voice of my supplications.

7. O Yahweh, My Lord, my saving strength, thou hast screened my head in the day of battle. 

8.  Do not grant, O Yahweh, the desires of the lawless one, his device, do not promote, They would exalt themselves. [Selah.]

9. As for the head of them who surround me, Let the mischief of their lips cover them:

10. May there be dropped on them live coals,—Into the fire, may they be let fall, into watery pits [from which] they shall not rise.

11. As for the slanderer, let him not be established in the earth,—As for the man of wrongful violence, let misfortune hunt him with thrust upon thrust.

12. I know that Yahweh will execute, the right of the oppressed one, the vindication of the needy.

13. Surely, the righteous, shall give thanks to thy Name, the upright shall dwell in thy presence.  

## Psalms 141

1. A Melody of David. O Yahweh, I have cried unto thee, Make thou haste to me, Give ear unto my voice, when I cry to thee.

2. Let my prayer be set in order like incense before thee,—the lifting up of my hands, as the evening gift.

3. Set thou, O Yahweh, a watch at my mouth, Keep thou guard over the door of my lips.

4. Let not my heart incline to a matter of wrong, that I should busy myself with practices in lawlessness, with men working iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties. 

5.  Let a righteous man smite me—a lovingkindness, that he should correct me, an oil for the head [which] let not my head refuse! For, yet, even my prayer, shall be in their calamities.

6. Their judges, have been hurled down by a crag, Now have men heard my sayings, for they have become sweet.

7. As when one plougheth and furroweth the earth, Scattered about, are our bones at the mouth of hades!

8. Surely, unto thee, O Yahweh, My Lord, are mine eyes, In thee, have I sought refuge, Do not pour out my life.

9. Keep me out of the clutches of the trap they have set for me, and the snares of the workers of iniquity.

10. They who are lawless, shall fall into the nooses thereof, while, I, at the same time, pass on.  

## Psalms 142

1. An Instructive Psalm of David. When he was in the Cave. A Prayer. With my voice—to Yahweh, make I outcry, With my voice—to Yahweh, make I supplication:

2. I pour out before him my complaint, My distress—before him, I tell.

3. When my spirit fainted concerning myself, then, thou, didst take note of my path,—In the course which I was about to take, they had hidden a snare for me. 

4.  Look to the right hand and see, that there is none that, for me, hath regard,—Escape is lost to me, There is no one to care for my life.

5. I have made outcry unto thee, O Yahweh,—I have said, Thou, art my refuge, my portion, in the land of the living.

6. Attend thou unto my loud cry, for I am brought very low,—Rescue me from my pursuers, for they are stronger than I.

7. O bring forth, out of prison, my soul, That I may give thanks unto thy Name,—About me, let the righteous gather round, for thou wilt deal bountifully with me.  

## Psalms 143

1. A Melody of David. O Yahweh, hear my prayer, Give ear to my supplications, In thy faithfulness, answer me, in thy righteousness.

2. Do not then enter into judgment with thy servant, for no one living, can appear just before thee.

3. For an enemy hath pursued my soul, hath crushed, to the earth, my life, hath made me dwell in dark places, like the ancient dead.

4. Therefore hath my spirit, fainted concerning myself, Within me, hath, my heart, been confounded.

5. I have remembered the days of aforetime, I have talked with myself of every deed of thine, Of the work of thy hands, I would speak:

6. I have spread out my hands unto thee, My soul, is as a thirsty land, for thee. [Selah.] 

7.  Speedily answer me, O Yahweh, My spirit faileth,—Do not hide thy face from me, or I shall be made like unto them who go down into the pit.

8. Let me hear, in the morning, thy lovingkindness, for, in thee, have, I trusted,—Let me know the way in which I should walk, for, unto thee, have I uplifted my soul.

9. Rescue me from my foes, O Yahweh, Unto thee, have I come seeking refuge.

10. Teach me to do thy good pleasure, for, thou, art my God,—Thy spirit, is good, thou wilt set me down to rest in a level land.

11. For the sake of thy Name, O Yahweh, wilt thou give unto me life, In thy righteousness, wilt thou bring forth, out of distress, my soul;

12. And, in thy lovingkindness, wilt thou exterminate my foes,—and destroy all the adversaries of my soul, because, I, am thy servant.  

## Psalms 144

1. David’s. Blessed be Yahweh, my Rock, who teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight:

2. My lovingkindness and my stronghold, my high tower and my deliverer—mine! My buckler, and he in whom I have sought refuge,—He that subdueth my people under me.

3. O Yahweh! what is the earthborn, And yet thou hast acknowledged him,—the son of a mortal, And yet thou hast taken account of him:

4. The earthborn, resembleth, a vapour, his days, are like a passing shadow.

5. O Yahweh! bow thy heavens and come down, Touch the mountains, that they smoke:

6. Flash forth lightning, that thou mayest scatter them, Send out thine arrows, that thou mayest confound them:

7. Put forth thy hands from on high:—Snatch me away and rescue me out of mighty waters, out of the hand of the sons of the alien,

8. Whose mouth, hath spoken deceit, and, whose right hand, is a right hand of falsehood. 

9.  O God! a new song, will I sing unto thee,—On a harp of ten strings, will I make music to thee:

10. Who giveth victory unto kings—Who snatcheth away David his servant, from the calamitous sword.

11. Snatch me away and rescue me out of he hand of the sons of the alien,—whose mouth hath spoken deceit, and, whose right hand, is a right hand of falsehood:—

12. That, our sons, may be like plants well grown while yet young,—Our daughters, like corner pillars,—carved, in the construction of a palace:

13. Our garners, full, pouring out from one kind to another; Our flocks, multiplying by thousands—by myriads, in our open fields:

14. Our oxen, well-laden; no breaking in and no departing,—and no loud lament in our places of concourse:—

15. How happy the people that is in such a case! How happy the people that hath Yahweh for its God!

21. The praise of Yahweh, my mouth shall speak, That all flesh may bless his holy Name, Unto times age-abiding and beyond.  

## Psalms 146

1. Praise ye Yah, Praise, O my soul, Yahweh.

2. I will praise Yahweh while I live! I will make melody to my God while I continue!

3. Do not ye trust in nobles, in a son of man who hath no deliverance:

4. His spirit, goeth forth, he returneth to his ground, In that very day, his thoughts perish. 

5.  How happy is he that hath the GOD of Jacob as his help, whose hope, is on Yahweh his God:—

6. Who made The heavens and the earth, The sea and all that is therein, Who keepeth faithfulness to times age-abiding:

7. Who executeth justice for the oppressed, who giveth food to the famishing, Yahweh, who liberateth prisoners;

8. Yahweh, who opened [the eyes of] the blind, Yahweh, who raiseth the prostrate, Yahweh, who loveth the righteous;

9. Yahweh, who preserveth sojourners, The fatherless and widows, he relieveth,—but, the way of the lawless, he overturneth.

10. Yahweh, will reign, to times age-abiding, Thy God, O Zion, to generation after generation. Praise ye Yah!  

## Psalms 147

1. Praise ye Yah, For it is good, to make melody to our GOD,—For it is delightful, seemly is praise!

2. Yahweh, is building Jerusalem, The outcasts of Israel, will he gather together.

3. He is healing the broken in heart,—and binding up their hurts.

4. Counting the number of the stars, To all of them—names, he giveth.

5. Great is our Lord, and of abounding strength, And, his knowledge, cannot be expressed.

6. Yahweh, relieveth the humbled! casting the lawless down to the earth.

7. Respond to Yahweh with thanksgiving, Make melody to our God with the lyre.

8. Who covereth the heavens with clouds, preparing rain for the earth, who causeth the mountains to sprout grass:

9. Giving, to the beast, its food, to the young ravens, when they cry.

10. Not in the strength of the horse, doth he delight, Not in the legs of a man, hath he pleasure:

11. Yahweh, hath pleasure, in them who revere him, in them who wait for his lovingkindness. 

12.  Laud thou, O Jerusalem, Yahweh, Praise thy God, O Zion:

13. For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates, He hath blessed thy children in thy midst:

14. Who maketh thy boundaries to be peace, With the marrow of wheat, doth he satisfy thee:

15. Who sendeth his utterance to the earth, How swiftly, runneth his word!

16. Who giveth snow like wool, Hoar-frost—like ashes, he scattereth:

17. Casting forth his ice like crumbs, Before his cold, who can stand?

18. He sendeth forth his word and melteth them, He causeth his wind to blow, the waters, stream along:

19. Declaring his word unto Jacob, His statutes and his regulations, unto Israel.

20. He hath not dealt so with any nation, and, his regulations, he maketh not known to them. Praise ye Yah!  

## Psalms 148

1. Praise ye Yah, Praise Yahweh, out of the heavens, Praise him, in the heights;

2. Praise him, all his messengers, Praise him, all his host;

3. Praise him, sun and moon, Praise him, all ye stars of light;

4. Praise him, O ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens;

5. Let them praise the Name of Yahweh, for, he, commanded, and they were created;

6. So caused he them to stand perpetually—age-abidingly, A decree, hath he given, and it passeth not beyond. 

7.  Praise Yahweh, out of the earth, sea monsters, and all resounding deeps;

8. Fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind, fulfilling his word;

9. Ye mountains, and all hills, fruit trees, and all cedars;

10. Thou wild-beast, and all ye cattle, crawling creature, and bird of wing;

11. Kings of earth, and all peoples, Rulers, and all judges of earth;

12. Young men, yea even virgins, elders, and children.

13. Let them praise the Name of Yahweh, for lofty is his Name alone, His splendour is over earth and heavens.

14. Therefore hath he exalted a horn for his people, a praise for all his men of lovingkindness, for the sons of Israel—a people near him, Praise ye Yah!  

## Psalms 149

1. Praise ye Yah, Sing to Yahweh a song that is new, his praise in the convocation of the men of lovingkindness.

2. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, Let the sons of Zion exult in their king;

3. Let them praise his Name in the dance, with timbrel and lyre, Let them make music to him.

4. For Yahweh is taking pleasure in his people, He will beautify humbled ones with victory.

5. Let the men of lovingkindness exult as they glory, Let them shout aloud upon their beds: 

6.  The high songs of GOD be in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand:

7. To execute an avenging among the nations, rebukes among the peoples:

8. To bind their kings with fetters, and their honoured ones with iron bands:

9. To execute upon them the sentence written, An honour, shall it be to all his men of lovingkindness. Praise ye Yah!  

## Psalms 150

1. Praise ye Yah, Praise ye GOD in his sanctuary, Praise him, in his strong expanse:

2. Praise him, for his mighty deeds, Praise him, according to his exceeding greatness:

3. Praise him, with the blast of a horn, Praise him, with the harp and lyre:

4. Praise him, with timbrel and dance,—Praise him, with stringed instrument and flute,

5. Praise him, with cymbals of clear tone,—Praise him, with cymbals of loud clang:

6. Let, every breathing thing, praise Yah, Praise ye Yah!
