## 1 Peter 1

1. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, unto the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion, throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,—

2. [Chosen] according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of Spirit, unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, Favour unto you, and peace, be multiplied! 

3.  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who, according to his great mercy, hath regenerated us unto a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead,

4. Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you

5. who, in God’s power, are being guarded through faith unto salvation—ready to be revealed in the last ripe time: 

6.  Wherein ye exult, though, for a little, just now, if needful, put to grief in manifold temptations,

7. In order that the proving of your faith—much more precious than of gold that perisheth even though, by means of fire, it is proved—may be found unto praise and glory and honour in the revealing of Jesus Christ,—

8. Whom, not having seen, ye love, on whom, though at present not looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with glory,

9. Being about to bear away the end of your faith—a salvation of souls: 

10.  Concerning which salvation, prophets—who concerning the favour for you, did prophesy—sought out and searched out,

11. Searching into what particular, or what manner, of season the Spirit of Christ which was in them was pointing to, when witnessing beforehand as to—The sufferings, for Christ, and the glories, after these,—

12. Unto whom it was revealed—that, Not unto themselves, but unto us, they were ministering them, which things have, now, been announced unto you through them who have told you the good tidings with Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven: into which things messengers are coveting to obtain a nearer view. 

13.  Wherefore, girding up the loins of your mind, keeping sober, perseveringly direct your hope unto the favour, being borne along to you, in the revealing of Jesus Christ:

14. As obedient persons, not configuring yourselves unto your former covetings in your ignorance:

15. But, according as he that hath called you is holy, do, ye yourselves, also become, holy in all manner of behaviour,—

16. Inasmuch as it is written—Holy shall ye be, because, I, am holy.

17. And, if, as Father, ye are invoking him who, without respect of persons, judgeth according to each man’s work, with reverence, for the time of your sojourning, behave ye;

18. Knowing that, Not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, have ye been redeemed from your unmeaning behaviour paternally handed down,

19. But with precious blood, as of a lamb, unblemished and unspotted, of an Anointed One,—

20. Foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, but made manifest at a last stage of the times, for the sake of you

21. who, through him, are faithful towards God,—Who raised him from among the dead, and glory to him gave, So that your faith and hope are directed towards God:

22. Having purified, your souls, by the obedience of the truth, unto unfeigned brotherly affection, from the heart, love, one another, earnestly;

23. Having been regenerated—Not out of corruptible seed, but incorruptible—through means of the word of a Living and Abiding God; 

24.  Inasmuch as—All flesh, is as grass, and, all the glory thereof, as the flower of grass,—The grass hath withered, and the flower hath fallen out,

25. But the declaration of the Lord age-abidingly remaineth; And, this, is a declaration which in the joyful message hath been announced unto you.  

## 1 Peter 2

1. Putting away, therefore, all vice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envyings and all detractions,

2. As new-born babes, for the pure milk that is for the mind, eagerly crave, that, thereby, ye may grow unto salvation:—

3. If ye have tasted for yourselves that, gracious, is the Lord,— 

4.  Unto whom coming near, as unto a living stone—by men, indeed, rejected, but, with God, chosen, held in honour,

5. Yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, well-pleasing unto God through Jesus Christ;

6. Inasmuch as it is contained in scripture—Lo! I lay in Zion an outmost corner stone, chosen, held in honour, and, he that resteth faith thereupon, shall not be put to shame.

7. Unto you, then, is the honour—[unto you] who believe; but, unto such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected,—The same, hath become head of the corner,

8. And a stone to strike against, and a rock to stumble over: Who stumble because, unto the word, they do not yield,—unto which also they have been appointed;

9. But, ye, are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a peculiar treasure, that, the excellences, ye may tell forth, of him who, out of darkness, hath called you into his marvellous light:—

10. Who, at one time, were a No-people, but, now, are a people of God,—who had not been enjoying mercy, but, now, have received mercy.

11. Beloved! I exhort you, as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly covetings, such as take the field against the soul;

12. Having, your behaviour among the nations, honourable,—in order that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may, owing to the honourable works they are permitted to behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. 

13.  Submit yourselves unto every human creation, for the Lord’s sake,—whether unto a king, as one that protecteth,

14. Or unto governors, as, through him, sent—for vengeance on evil-doers, but praise to such as do good;

15. Because, so, is the will of God,—by doing good, to be putting to silence, the ignorance of heedless men:

16. As free, yet, not as a cloak of vice, holding your freedom, but, as God’s servants.

17. Unto all men, give honour, unto the brotherhood, shew love, unto God, give reverence, the king, hold in honour.

18. Ye domestics, submitting yourselves, in all reverence, unto your masters,—not only unto the good and considerate, but also unto the perverse;

19. For, this, is thankworthy,—If, for the sake of conscience towards God, one beareth griefs, suffering wrongfully,—

20. For what sort of honour is it—if, committing sin, and being buffeted, ye endure it? But, if, doing good, and suffering, ye endure it, this, is thankworthy with God.

21. For, hereunto, have ye been called; because, Christ also, suffered in your behalf, unto you, leaving behind a pattern, that ye might follow in his steps:

22. Who did not, a sin, commit, neither was deceit found in his mouth,—

23. Who, being reviled, was not reviling again, suffering, he was not threatening, but was making surrender unto him that judgeth righteously,—

24. Who, our sins, himself, bare up, in his body, unto the tree, in order that we, from our sins getting away, in righteousness, might live,—by whose stripes, ye have been healed;

25. For ye were as sheep going astray, but have now turned back unto the shepherd and overseer of your souls.  

## 1 Peter 3

1. In like manner, ye wives,—submitting yourselves unto your own husbands; in order that, if any are not yielding unto the word, through their wives behaviour, they may, without the word, be won,

2. Having been permitted to behold your reverently chaste behaviour,—

3. Whose adorning, let it be—not the outward, of plaiting the hair and wearing golden ornaments, or putting on of apparel,

4. But the hidden character, of the heart,—in the incorruptible [ornament] of the quiet, and meek, spirit, which is, in presence of God, of great price.

5. For, so, at one time, the holy women also, who directed their hope towards God, used to adorn themselves, being in submission unto their own husbands:

6. As, Sarah, was obedient unto Abraham, calling him, lord,—whose children ye have become—so long as ye are doing good, and not bringing yourselves into fear of any single cause of alarm.

7. Ye husbands, in like manner, dwelling with them according to knowledge,—as unto a weaker vessel, unto the female [vessel], assigning honour, as joint—inheritors also of life’s favour,—to the end that unhindered may be, your prayers. 

8.  And, finally, all, being of one mind, having fellow—feeling, attached to the brethren, of tender affection, of lowly mind:

9. Not returning evil for evil, nor reviling for reviling, but, on the contrary, bestowing a blessing,—because, hereunto, have ye been called, in order that, a blessing, ye might inherit.

10. For, he that desireth to love, life, and to see good days, Let him cause his tongue to cease from mischief, and lips, that they speak not deceit;

11. Let him turn away from mischief, and do good, Let him seek peace, and pursue it;

12. Because, the eyes of the Lord, are towards the righteous, and his ears, unto their supplication,—Whereas, the face of the Lord, is against them that are doing mischievous things.

13. Who, then, is he that shall harm you, if, for that which is good, ye become zealous?

14. Nevertheless, even if ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy [are ye] ! Their fear, however, do not fear, neither be troubled;

15. But, the Lord Christ, hallow ye in your hearts, ready always for a defence, unto every one that is asking you a reason concerning, the hope within you,—nevertheless, with meekness and reverence: 

16.  Having, a good conscience, in order that, wherein they speak against you, they may be put to shame who cast wanton insult on, your good behaviour in Christ.

17. For it is, better, as well-doers, if it should please the pleasure of God, to be suffering, than, as evil-doers: 

18.  Because, Christ also, once for all, concerning sins, died,—Just in behalf of unjust,—in order that he might introduce us unto God; being put to death, indeed, in flesh, but made alive in spirit,—

19. In which, even unto the spirits in prison, he went and proclaimed,—

20. [Spirits] unyielding at one time, when the longsuffering of God was holding forth a welcome in the days of Noah, there being in preparation an ark—[going] into which, a few, that is eight, souls, were brought safely through by means of water,— 

21.  Which [water] in manner corresponding, doth, now, save, you also—even immersion,—not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the request unto God, for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,—

22. Who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, messengers and authorities and powers, having been made subject unto him.  

## 1 Peter 4

1. Christ, then, having suffered in flesh, do, ye also, with the same purpose, arm yourselves,—because, he that hath suffered in flesh, hath done with sins,—

2. To the end that, no longer, in men’s covetings, but in God’s will, ye may live, the still remaining time.

3. For, sufficient, is the bygone time—to have wrought out, the will of the nations, having gone on in wanton ways, covetings, wine-drinkings, revellings, drinking-bouts, and impious idolatries:— 

4.  Wherein they are taken by surprise that ye run not with them into the same overflow of riotous excess,—uttering defamation:

5. Who shall render an account unto him who is holding in readiness to judge living and dead;

6. For, unto this end, even unto the dead, was the glad-message delivered,—in order that they might be judged, indeed, according to men in flesh, but might live according to God in spirit. 

7.  But, the end of all things, hath drawn near:—be of sound mind, therefore, and be sober for prayers;

8. Before all things, keeping, fervent, your love, among yourselves, because, love, covereth a multitude of sins;

9. Showing hospitality one to another without murmuring,—

10. Each one, according as he hath received a gift of favour, unto one another, ministering the same, as careful stewards of the manifold favour of God:

11. If any one speaketh, as oracles of God, if any one ministereth, as of strength which, God, supplieth,—that, in all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,—unto whom are the glory and the dominion, unto the ages of ages. Amen! 

12.  Beloved! be not held in surprise by the burning among you, which, for putting you to the proof, is befalling you, as though a, surprising, thing were happening unto you;

13. But, in so far as ye are taking fellowship in the Christ’s sufferings, rejoice! in order that, in the revealing of his glory also, ye may rejoice with exultation:

14. If ye are being reproached in the name of Christ, happy [are ye] ! Because, the Spirit, of the glory, and the [Spirit] of God, unto you is bringing rest.

15. For let, none of you, be suffering as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as one prying into other men’s affairs;

16. But, if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but be glorifying God in this name.

17. For it is the ripe time for the judgment to begin with the house of God; but, if first with us, what shall be the end of them who yield not unto the glad-message of God?

18. And, if, the righteous man, is, with difficulty, saved, where then shall, the ungodly and sinful man, appear?

19. So then, let, them who are even suffering, according to the will of God, unto a faithful Creator, be committing their souls, in well-doing.  

## 1 Peter 5

1. Elders, therefore, among you, I exhort—[I] who am their co-elder and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also, in the glory about to be revealed, have, a share;—

2. Shepherd the beloved flock of God, which is among you,—not by compulsion, but by choice, nor yet for base gain, but of a ready mind,—

3. Nor yet as lording it over the allotted portions, but becoming, ensamples, to the beloved flock;

4. And, when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, ye shall bear away, the unfading crown of glory. 

5.  In like manner, ye younger men—submit yourselves unto elders;—All, however, one towards another, gird on humility; because, God, against the haughty, arrayeth himself, whereas, unto the lowly, he giveth favour.

6. Be made lowly, therefore, under the strong hand of God, that he may lift, you, up in due time,—

7. All your anxiety, casting upon him, because he careth for you. 

8.  Be sober! be watchful! Your slanderous adversary, as a roaring lion, is walking about—seeking to devour:

9. Whom resist, steadfast in your faith, knowing that, the same sufferings, in your brotherhood that is in the world, are being accomplished. 

10.  Howbeit, the God of all favour—who hath called you unto his age-abiding glory in Christ—when, for a little, ye have suffered, Himself, will adjust, confirm, strengthen:—

11. Unto him, be the dominion, unto the ages. Amen!

12. By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I account him, have I briefly written, unto you, exhorting and adding testimony—that, this, is the true favour of God—within which, stand ye fast!

13. She who, in Babylon, is co-elect, and Mark my son, salute you:

14. Salute ye one another with a kiss of love. Peace unto you all who are in Christ.
