# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Since many have undertaken to compose a history of the things that are fully believed among us,

2. even as they were delivered to us by those who were, from the beginning, eye-witnesses and ministers of the word;

3. it seemed good to me also, having obtained exact information of all things from the very first, to write them in order for you, most excellent Theophilus,

4. that you might know the certainty of the things in which you have been instructed.  

5. There was, in the days of Herod the king of Judea, a certain priest, named Zachariah, of the class of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

6. They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.

7. And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.  

8. It came to pass, while he was officiating as priest before God, in the order of his class, that,

9. according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense, when he went into the temple of the Lord.

10. And all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.

11. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.  

12. And Zachariah was troubled at the sight, and fear fell upon him.

13. But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachariah; for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.

14. And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.

15. For he shall be great before the Lord; and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.

16. And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.

17. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient, by the wisdom of the just, in order to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.  

18. And Zachariah said to the angel: By what sign shall I know this? for I am old, and my wife is advanced in years.

19. And the angel answered and said to him: I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I am sent to speak to you, and to announce to you this good news.

20. And behold, you shall be dumb and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because you did not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their proper time.

21. And the people were waiting for Zachariah, and they wondered that he stayed so long in the temple.

22. But when he came out, he was not able to speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them, and remained speechless.  

23. And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, that he departed to his own house.

24. And after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself retired for five months, saying:

25. Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he has looked with regard upon me, to take away my reproach among men.  

26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

27. to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.  

28. And the angel came into her presence, and said: Hail, graciously accepted: the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women.

29. And she was perplexed at his words, and reasoned, what this salutation could mean.

30. And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary; for you have found favor with God.

31. And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.

32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father;

33. and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.  

34. But Mary said to the angel: How shall this be, since I know not a man?

35. And the angel answered and said to her: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; for which reason, also, that which is begotten, being holy, shall be called the Son of God.

36. And behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman, even she has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren;

37. for nothing shall be impossible with God.

38. And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.  

39. And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the mountainous country, into a city of Judah;

40. and she came into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth.

41. And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, that the babe in her womb leaped for joy.

42. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke with a loud voice, and said: Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

43. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. For, behold, when the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.

45. And blessed is she who believed; for there shall be a fulfillment of the things which were spoken to her from the Lord.  

46. And Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord,

47. and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior;

48. for he has looked upon the lowly condition of his handmaid. For, behold, from this time, all generations shall call me blessed;

49. for He that is Mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name:

50. and his mercy is from generation to generation upon those who fear him.

51. He has done mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their hearts.

52. He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly.

53. He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich he has sent empty away.

54. He has helped Israel his servant, (as he spoke to our fathers,)

55. by remembering his mercy to Abraham and to his posterity forever.  

56. And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.  

57. Now the time for Elizabeth to be delivered had fully come; and she gave birth to a son.

58. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had showed great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.  

59. And it came to pass, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father, Zachariah.

60. And his mother answered and said: Not so: but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her: There is no one among your relatives that is called by this name.

62. And they made signs to his father, to know what he wished him to be called.

63. And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying: His name is John. And they were all astonished.  

64. And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue was loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.

65. And fear came on all that dwelt round about them; and all these things were talked of everywhere throughout the mountainous country of Judea.

66. And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, and said: What, then, will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.  

67. And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:

68. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people;

69. and he has raised up for us, in the house of David his servant, a horn of salvation,

70. (as he spoke by the mouth of all his holy prophets of ancient times,)

71. salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,

72. in order to show the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,

73. the oath which he swore to Abraham our father,

74. that he would grant to us, that being delivered from the hands of our enemies, we might serve him without fear,

75. in holiness and righteousness before him, all our days.  

76. And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High; for you shall go before the face of the Lord, to make ready his ways,

77. by giving to his people the knowledge of salvation in the remission of their sins,

78. through the tender mercies of our God; by which the dawn from on high has visited us,

79. to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, by guiding our feet in the way of peace.  

80. And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.   

## Luke 2

1. And it came to pass in those days, that there went forth a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the inhabitants of the land should be enrolled.

2. This enrollment first took place when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.

3. And all went to be enrolled, each one to his own city.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, (for he was of the house and family of David,).

5. to be enrolled with Mary his betrothed wife, who was with child.  

6. And it came to pass while they were there, that the days for her to be delivered were completed;

7. and she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swathing-clothes, and laid him in the stable, because there was no place for them in the inn.  

8. And there were in the same country shepherds, living in the open field, and guarding their flock by night.

9. And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were greatly afraid.

10. And the angel said to them: Be not afraid; for, behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which shall be for all people.

11. For there is born for you this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

12. And this shall be to you the sign: you will find the babe wrapped in swathing-clothes, and lying in a stable.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying:

14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will among men.  

15. And it came to pass, that, after the angels had gone away into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us now go to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.

16. And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the stable.

17. And after they had seen it, they made known everywhere the words that had been spoken to them of this child.

18. And all that heard, wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary kept all these things in her mind, and pondered them in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen, as it had been told to them.  

21. And when eight days were completed for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, as it had been called by the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.  

22. And when the days for their purification were completed according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,

23. (as it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

24. and to offer a sacrifice, according to that which is commanded in the law of the Lord: A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.  

25. And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon. And this man was just and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him:

26. and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Anointed.

27. And he came by the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,

28. he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and said:

29. Now, Lord, thou dost let thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word,

30. for my eyes have seen thy salvation,

31. which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

32. a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.  

33. And Joseph and his mother wondered at the things which were spoken of him.

34. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign to be spoken against,

35. (and a sword shall pierce through your own soul,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.  

36. And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was of great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity:

37. and she was a widow of about eighty-four years, and she departed not from the temple, but served, day and night, with fastings and prayers.

38. And she came in at that hour, and gave thanks to Lord, and spoke of him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.  

39. And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.  

41. And his parents went up every year to Jerusalem, at the feast of passover.

42. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast.

43. And when they had kept the full number of days, and had set out to return, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew it not.

44. But supposing that he was in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their relatives and acquaintance;

45. and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of him.  

46. And it came to pass, after three days, that they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions.

47. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding, and his answers.

48. And when they saw him they were amazed. And his mother said to him: Child, why have you acted thus toward us? Behold, your father and I have sought for you in sorrow.

49. And he said to them: Why did you seek for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?

50. And they did not understand the words which he spoke to them.

51. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with man.   

## Luke 3

1. In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,

2. Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness.  

3. And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the immersion of repentance in order to the remission of sins;

4. as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight;

5. every ravine shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made level; and the crooked ways shall be made straight; and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

6. and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.  

7. Therefore he said to the multitudes that came out to be immersed by him: Generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Bring forth, therefore, fruits worthy of repentance. And begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.

9. And now also the ax is lying at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.  

10. And the multitudes asked him, saying: What, then, shall we do?

11. He answered and said to them: He that has two coats, let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise.

12. And the publicans also came to be immersed, and they said to him: Teacher, what shall we do?

13. And he said to them: Exact no more than that which is appointed you.

14. And soldiers also asked him, saying: And what shall we do? And he said to them: Take nothing from any one by extortion, nor by false accusation, and be content with your pay.  

15. While the people were in suspense, and all were reasoning in their hearts about John, whether he was the Christ or not,

16. John answered them all, saying: I indeed immerse you in water; but there comes One mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose; he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.

17. His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his thrashing-floor, and gather the grain into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

18. With many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people.  

19. But Herod the tetrarch having been reproved by him on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, and for all the wicked deeds which Herod did,

20. added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.  

21. And it came to pass, while all the people were being immersed, that Jesus also was immersed; and as he was praying, the heaven was opened,

22. and the Holy Spirit descended upon him, in a bodily form, like a dove; and there came a voice from heaven, which said: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I delight.

23. And Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his ministry, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, son of Heli,

24. son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Malchi, son of Janna, son of Joseph,

25. son of Mattathiah, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggæ,

26. son of Maath, son of Mattathiah, son of Shimoi, son of Joseph, son of Judah,

27. son of Joannah, son of Rhesa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri,

28. son of Malchi, son of Addi, son of Kosam, son of Elmodam, son of Er,

29. son of Jose, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi,

30. son of Simeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonan, son of Eliakim,

31. son of Meleah, son of Mainan, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,  

32. Son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,

33. son of Aminidab, son of Aram, son of Esrom, son of Phares, son of Judah,

34. son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,

35. son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Salah,

36. son of Kenan, son of Arphaxad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,

37. son of Methusalah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalaleel, son of Kenan,

38. son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.   

## Luke 4

1. And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

2. and was there forty days, to be tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days; and when they were ended, he was afterward hungry.

3. And the devil said to him: If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.

4. And Jesus answered him, and said: It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.  

5. And the devil took him up into a high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, in a moment of time.

6. And the devil said to him: I will give you all the authority and glory of these, for it is delivered to me; and to whomever I will, I give it.

7. If, therefore, you will bow with reverence before me, all shall be yours.

8. And Jesus answered and said to him: Get behind me, Satan; it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.  

9. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him: If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from this place;

10. for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning you, to guard you carefully;

11. and in their hands they shall take you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.

12. And Jesus answered and said to him: It is said, You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof.

13. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a time.  

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and his fame went throughout the whole of that region.

15. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.  

16. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and, as his custom was, he entered the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and stood up to read.

17. And the volume of Isaiah the prophet was given to him: and when he had unrolled the volume, he found the place where it was written:

18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind; to set free the oppressed;

19. to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.

20. And he rolled up the volume, and save it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all that were in the synagogue were earnestly fixed upon him.  

21. And he began to say to them: This scripture which you have heard, is this day fulfilled.

22. And all extolled him; and they wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth, and said: Is not this the son of Joseph?

23. And he said to them: You will assuredly apply to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever things we have heard were done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.

24. And he said: Verily I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.

25. And I tell you, in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, so that a great famine was on all the land:

26. and to no one of them was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.

27. And many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet; and no one of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.  

28. And all that were in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with anger,

29. and arose, and drove him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.

30. But he passed through the midst of them, and went away.  

31. And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath-days.

32. And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.

33. And there was in the synagogue a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,

34. saying: Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Nazarene? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Be silent, and come out of him. And the demon threw him into the midst, and came out of him, and hurt him not.

36. And amazement came upon all, and they spoke one to another, saying: What teaching is this? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.

37. And his fame went abroad into every place of the country round about.  

38. And he arose and went out of the synagogue into the house of Simon. And Simon’s mother-in-law was confined with a violent fever: and they besought him in her behalf.

39. And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her: and she arose immediately, and ministered to them.  

40. And when the sun had gone down, all that had any sick with various diseases, brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and cured them.

41. Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying: Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuked them, and did not permit them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.  

42. And when it was day, he went out and departed into a desert place; and the multitudes sought for him, and came to him and endeavored to detain him, that he should not go away from them.

43. But he said to them: I must make known the good news of the kingdom of God to other cities also; for to this end I have been sent.

44. And he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.   

## Luke 5

1. And it came to pass while the multitude was pressing on him to hear the word of God, and he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,

2. that he saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

3. And he entered one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and requested him to push out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitude from the ship.  

4. And when he had made an end of speaking, he said to Simon: Push out into the deep water, and let down your nets for a draught.

5. And Simon answered and said to him: Master, we have toiled all night and have caught nothing; but at thy command, I will let down the net.

6. And when they had done this, they inclosed a great number of fishes, and their net began to break;

7. and they beckoned to their partners who were in the other ship, to come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.  

8. And when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, and said: Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.

9. For amazement at the draught of fishes which they had caught had seized upon him and all that were with him;

10. and in like manner also upon James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon: Fear not; from this time forth you shall catch men.

11. And when they had brought their ships to the land, they left all and followed him.  

12. And it came to pass, that he was in one of their cities; and behold, a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and besought him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

13. And stretching out his hand, he touched him, and said: I will; be clean. And immediately his leprosy departed from him.

14. And he charged him to tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and make offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, that it may be a testimony to them.

15. But his fame went abroad the more; and many multitudes came together to hear, and to be cured by him of their infirmities.

16. And he withdrew to the deserts and prayed.  

17. And it came to pass, on a certain day, that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was exerted to heal them.

18. And behold, men brought, on a bed, a man who was a paralytic. And they sought how they might bring him in, and lay him before him.

19. And finding no way by which they could bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up on the top of the house, and, through the tiling, let him down, with his bed, into the midst before Jesus.

20. And when he saw their faith, he said to him: Man, your sins are forgiven you.

21. And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying: Who is this that utters impious words? Who can forgive sins but God alone?  

22. But Jesus perceived their reasonings, and answered and said to them: Why are you reasoning in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say., Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise and walk?

24. But that you may know that the Son of man on the earth has power to forgive sins, (he said to the paralytic,) I say to you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go to your house.

25. And he immediately arose before them, took up that on which he had been lying, and went away to his own house, glorifying God.

26. And astonishment seized upon all, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying: We have seen strange things to-day.  

27. And after these tilings, he went out and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him: Follow me.

28. And leaving all, he arose and followed him.

29. And Levi made him a great feast at his own house; and there was a great multitude of publicans and others, who reclined at table with them.

30. And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying: Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

31. And Jesus answered arid said to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.

32. I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners, to repentance.  

33. And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?

34. And he said to them: Can you make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them; then shall they fast in those days.  

36. And he spoke also a parable to them: No one patches an old garment with a piece taken from a new garment. If so, the new tears it, and the patch from the new suits not the old.

37. And no one puts new wine into old bottles; if so, the new wine will burst the bottles, and it will be spilled, and the bottles will be destroyed.

38. But new wine must be put into new bottles, and both will be preserved.

39. And no one, after drinking old wine, immediately desires new; for he says: The old is better.   

## Luke 6

1. And it came to pass, on the first sabbath after the second day of the feast, that he was going through the fields of grain; and his disciples pulled the ears and ate, rubbing them in their hands.

2. And some of the Pharisees said to them: Why are you doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?

3. And Jesus answered and said to them: Have you not read even that which David did, when he was hungry himself, and those who were with him,

4. that he entered the house of God, and took the loaves of the presence, and ate, and gave to those also who were with him, which it is not lawful, except for the priests alone, to eat?

5. And he said to them: The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.  

6. And it came to pass, on another sabbath, that he entered the synagogue and taught; and a man was there, whose right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and Pharisees watched closely, whether he would heal on the sabbath-day, that they might find an accusation against him.

8. But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had the withered hand: Rise, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose, and stood.

9. Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you a question: Which is lawful on the sabbath, to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?

10. And looking round upon them all, he said to him: Stretch forth your hand. And he did so; and his hand was restored like the other.

11. But they were filled with madness, and began to consult with one another what they should do to Jesus.  

12. And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he spent the night in prayer to God.

13. And when it was day, he called to him his disciples; and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:

14. Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon who is called Zelotes,

16. Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was also the traitor.

17. And he came down with them, and stood in a plain; and with him stood a multitude of his disciples, and a great number of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases,

18. and those who were oppressed by evil spirits; and they were cured.

19. And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for power went forth from him, and healed them all.  

20. And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: Blessed are you that are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.

21. Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh.

22. Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and shall withdraw themselves from you, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of man.

23. Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for behold, your reward is great in heaven: for so did their fathers to the prophets.  

24. But alas for you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.

25. Alas for you that are full! for you shall be hungry. Alas for you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.

26. Alas for you, when men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.  

27. But I say to you that hear: Love your enemies; do good to them that hate you;

28. bless them that curse you; pray for them that abuse you.

29. To him that strikes you on one cheek, offer also the other; and from him that takes away your mantle, withhold not your coat.

30. Give to every one that asks of you; and of him that takes away your goods, ask them not again.

31. And as you would that men should do to you, do you also in like manner to them.

32. And if you love them that love you, what thanks have you? for even sinners love those who love them.

33. And if you do good to them that do good to you, what thanks have you? for even sinners do the same.

34. And if you lend to them from whom you hope to receive, what thanks have you? for even sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive the same.

35. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind to the unthankful and the evil.

36. Be you, therefore, merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  

37. Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.

38. Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your lap. For with the same measure with which you measure, it shall be measured to you in return.  

39. And he spoke a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Will not both fall into the pit?

40. The disciple is not above his teacher; but every accomplished disciple shall be as his teacher.  

41. And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother’s eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?

42. Or, how can you say to your brother: Brother, let me pull out the splinter that is in your eye, when you yourself see not the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite, first pull the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the splinter that is in your brother’s eye.

43. For a good tree does not produce unsound fruit; nor does an unsound tree produce good fruit.

44. For every tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes gathered from brambles.

45. The good man, out of the good treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is good; and the evil man, out of the evil treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.  

46. But why call me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I command?

47. Every one that comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.

48. He is like a man that, when building a house, digged deep, and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the torrent dashed against that house, and it was not able to shake it, for it was founded on the rock.

49. But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth, without a foundation, against which the torrent dashed with violence, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.   

## Luke 7

1. And when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he went into Capernaum.

2. And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and about to die.

3. But when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, and besought him to come and save his servant.

4. And they came to Jesus, and besought him earnestly, saying: He is worthy for whom thou shouldst do this;

5. for he loves our nation, and of his own accord has built us a synagogue.

6. And Jesus went with them.   And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, and said to him: Lord, give thyself no trouble; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof.

7. For which reason, neither did I count myself worthy to go to thee; but command in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

8. For I am a man placed under authority, and have soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

9. And when Jesus heard these things, he was filled with admiration for him; and, turning to the multitude that followed, he said: I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith.

10. And they that had been sent, returned to the house, and found the servant that had been sick restored to health.  

11. And it came to pass, the next day, that he was going to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples and a great multitude followed him.

12. And when he came near the gate of tho city, behold, they were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude from the city was with her.

13. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her: Weep not.

14. And he went and touched the bier; and those who were carrying it, stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to you, Arise.

15. And he that had been dead, sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.

16. And fear seized on all; and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet has arisen among us; and, God has visited his people.

17. And this report concerning him went abroad into all Judea and all the neighboring region.  

18. And the disciples of John told him of all these things.

19. And John called to him two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, and said: Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?

20. And the men came to him and said: John the Immerser has sent us to thee, and says, Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?

21. And in that very hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and bestowed sight on many that were blind.

22. And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them;

23. and blessed is he who shall find no cause of offense in me.  

24. And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

25. But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear splendid apparel, and live in luxury, are in kings houses.

26. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

28. For I say to you, Among those born of women, there is no prophet greater than John the Immerser. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

29. And all the people, and the publicans that heard him, vindicated God, by being immersed with the immersion of John;

30. but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God in regard to themselves, by not being immersed by him.

31. To what, then, shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in the market-place, who call to one another, and say, We have played on the pipe for you, and you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs for you, and you have not lamented.

33. For John the Immerser came, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.

34. The Son of man has come, eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners.

35. Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.  

36. And one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and reclined at table.

37. And, behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that he reclined at table in the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

38. and stood behind at his feet, weeping; and she began to wash his feet with her tears; and she wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.

39. But when the Pharisee who had invited him, saw it, he said within himself: This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who, and what sort of woman this is that touches him; for she is a sinner.  

40. And Jesus answered and said to him: Simon, I have something to say to you. He replied: Teacher, say on.

41. A certain creditor had two debtors; the one owed him five hundred denarii, the other, fifty.

42. But as they had nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them, then, will love him the more?

43. Simon answered and said: I suppose he to whom he forgave the more. He said to him: You have decided correctly.  

44. And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon: Do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.

45. You gave me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.

46. You did not anoint my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with ointment.

47. Wherefore, I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much. But he to whom little is forgiven, loves little.

48. And he said to her: Your sins are forgiven.

49. And those who reclined at table with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that also forgives sins?

50. But he said to the woman: Your faith has saved you; go in peace.   

## Luke 8

1. And it came to pass afterward, that he went through every city and village, preaching, and making known the good news of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him;

2. and also certain women that had been cured of evil spirits and diseases; Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven demons,

3. and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him from their means.  

4. And when a great multitude had assembled, and they were coming to him from every city, he spoke by a parable:

5. The sower went forth to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air ate it up.

6. And some fell upon the rock; and when it had sprung up, it withered, because it had no moisture.

7. And some fell in the midst of thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.

8. And other seed fell into good ground, and sprung up, and produced fruit a hundred-fold. When he had said these things, he cried: He that has ears to hear, let him hear.  

9. And the disciples asked him, saying: What does this parable mean?

10. He replied: To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that when they see, they may not see, and when they hear, they may not understand.

11. But the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the word of God;

12. those by the wayside are they that hear; then comes the devil and takes the word from their heart, lest they should believe and be saved.

13. Those on the rock are they that, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who, for awhile, believe, and in time of temptation apostatize.

14. That which fell among thorns are those who hear, and so conduct themselves, that they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

15. But that on the good ground are those who, in a good and honest heart, hear the word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.  

16. No one when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a divan, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who come in may see the light.

17. For there is nothing concealed, that shall not be made manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known and brought into view.

18. Take heed, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, even that which he seems to have shall be taken from him.  

19. And his mother and his brothers came to him, but were not able to get near him on account of the multitude.

20. And it was told him by some that said: Thy mother and thy brothers stand without, desiring to see thee.

21. But he answered and said to them: My mother and my brothers are they that hear the word of God and do it.  

22. And it came to pass, on a certain day, that he entered a ship with his disciples; and he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they set sail.

23. And while they were sailing, he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down upon the lake, and they began to be filled, and were in danger.

24. And they came to him, and awoke him, saying: Master, master, we perish. But he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And he said to them: Where is your faith? And being afraid, they wondered, and said one to another: Who, then, is this, that he commands even the wind and the water, and they obey him?  

26. And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite to Galilee.

27. And when he came out upon the land, there met him a certain man from the city, who had been possessed with demons for a long time, and who wore no clothes, and dwelt in no house, but in the tombs.

28. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, torment me not.

29. For he had O; commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized upon him, and he had been bound with chains and fetters, and kept in confinement; and he broke the bonds, and was driven by the demon into the deserts.

30. And Jesus asked him, saying: What is your name? He answered, Legion; for many demons had entered into him.

31. And they be sought him, that he would not command them to go away into the abyss.  

32. And there was in that place a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. And they besought him to permit them to go into them. And he permitted them.

33. And the demons came out of the man, and went into the swine; and the herd rushed down a steep place into the lake, and were drowned.

34. And when those who fed them saw what was done, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.

35. And they came out to see what had been done; and they came to Jesus, and saw the man out of whom the demons had gone, clothed, and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.

36. And those who had seen it, told them by what means the man who had been possessed with the demons, was saved.  

37. And the whole multitude of the neighboring country of the Gadarenes besought him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear. And he entered the ship and returned.

38. And the man out of whom the demons had gone, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying:

39. Return to your house, and tell what things God has done for you. And he went away, proclaiming through the whole city what Jesus had done for him.  

40. And it came to pass, when Jesus returned, that the multitude received him gladly; for they were all waiting for him.

41. And, behold, there came a man, whose name was Jairus; and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him to come into his house;

42. for he had a daughter, his only child, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And as he went, the multitude pressed upon him.  

43. And a woman that had been afflicted with an issue of blood for twelve years, who had spent her whole living upon physicians, and could be cured by no one,

44. came behind, and touched the fringe of his mantle; and her issue of blood immediately ceased.

45. And Jesus said: Who touched me? When they all denied, Peter and those with him said: Master, the multitudes press upon thee, and throng thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?

46. But Jesus said: Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.

47. And the woman, seeing that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and fell down before him, and told him, before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and that she was immediately restored to health.

48. And he said to her: Take courage, daughter; your faith has saved you; go in peace.  

49. While he was yet speaking, there came some one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and said to him: Your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.

50. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying: Fear not, only believe, and she shall be saved.

51. And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to go in but Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the child.

52. And all were weeping and lamenting her. But he said: Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.

53. And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.

54. But he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, and said: Child, arise.

55. And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And he commanded that food should be given her.

56. And her parents were amazed. But he charged them to tell no one what had been done.   

## Luke 9

1. And he called his twelve disciples to him, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases:

2. and he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

3. And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; nor have two coats each.

4. And whatever house you enter, there remain, and thence depart.

5. And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off even the dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.

6. And they departed, and went through every village, preaching the gospel, and performing cures everywhere.  

7. And Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some, that John had risen from the dead;

8. and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that a prophet of ancient times had risen again.

9. And Herod said: John I have beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.  

10. And the apostles returned, and told him all that they had done. And he took them, and withdrew privately to a desert place, that belonged to a city called Bethsaida.

11. But the multitudes knew it, and followed him; and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.  

12. And the day began to decline; and the twelve came and said to him: Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and the country round about, and lodge, and find food; for we are here in a desert place.

13. But he said to them: Do you give them food. They replied: We have nothing but five loaves and two fishes, unless we go and buy food for all these people.

14. For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Make them recline in companies of fifty.

15. And they did so, and made them all recline.

16. And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave them to the disciples, to set before the multitude.

17. And they all ate, and were satisfied; and there was taken up what remained to them of the broken pieces, twelve baskets.  

18. And it came to pass, as he was praying in a retired place, that his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying: Who do the multitudes say that I am?

19. They answered and said: John the Immerser; but some, Elijah; and others, that some prophet of ancient times has risen again.

20. He said to them: But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said: The Christ of God.

21. And he strictly charged them and commanded them to tell this to no one,

22. saying: The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised the third day.  

23. And he said to them all: If any one determines to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

24. For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall save it.

25. For what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and destroy himself, or be lost?

26. For whoever will be ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in his own glory; and that of the Father, and of the holy angels.

27. But I say to you, of a truth, there are some of these who stand here that shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.  

28. And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

29. And as he prayed, the appearance of his face was changed, and his raiment became white and glittering.

30. And, behold, two men conversed with him, who were Moses and Elijah;

31. they appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.  

32. And Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; but having fully awakened, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

33. And it came to pass, that, as they were withdrawing from him, Peter said to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for. Elijah, not knowing what he said.

34. While he was saying these things, there came a cloud, and it overshadowed them; and they were afraid as those men entered the cloud.

35. And there came a voice from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son; hear him.

36. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it secret, and told no one, in those days, any of the things which they had seen.  

37. And it came to pass, that, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.

38. And, behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying: Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, for he is my only child;

39. and, behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it throws him into convulsions, and causes him to foam, and after depriving him of strength, hardly departs from him.

40. And I entreated thy disciples to cast it out; but they were not able.

41. And Jesus answering, said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you! Bring your son hither.

42. And while he was coming, the demon cast him to the ground, and threw him into convulsions; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and restored the child to health, and gave him back to his father.

43. And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God.   And while they were all wondering at every thing that Jesus did, he said to his disciples:

44. Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.

45. But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they might not understand it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.  

46. And there arose a contention among them, which of them should be greatest.

47. But Jesus perceived the thought of their heart, and he took a little child, and made it stand by him,

48. and said to them: Whoever will receive this little child on my account, receives me; and whoever will receive me, receives him that sent me. For he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.  

49. And John answered and said: Master, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.

50. And Jesus said to him: Forbid him not; for whoever is not against us, is for us.  

51. And it came to pass, as the time for him to be taken up into heaven had fully come, that he set his face steadfastly to go up to Jerusalem.

52. And he sent messengers before his face; and they went, and entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for him.

53. And they did not receive him, because his face was turned toward Jerusalem.

54. And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said: Lord, is it thy will that we command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, even as Elijah did?

55. But he turned and rebuked them, and said: You know not of what spirit you are.

56. And they went to another village.  

57. And it came to pass, as they were going on their journey, that a certain man said to him: Lord, I will follow thee wherever thou shalt go.

58. And Jesus said to him: The foxes have dens, and the birds of the air have roosts, but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.

59. And he said to another: Follow me. But he replied: Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.

60. Jesus said: Let the dead bury their own dead; but do you go and publish abroad the kingdom of God.

61. And another said: I will follow thee, Lord; but first permit me to take leave of those at home.

62. Jesus said to him: No one that puts his hand to the plow, and looks back, is fit for the kingdom of God.   

## Luke 10

1. And after these things, the Lord appointed seventy others, also, and sent them, two and two, before his face, into every city and place to which he himself was about to go.

2. He said, therefore, to them: The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest that he send out laborers into his harvest.

3. Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Carry no purse, nor bag, nor sandals; and salute no one on the road.

5. Whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.

6. And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on him; but, if not, it shall return upon you.

7. And in that house remain, eating and drinking what they have to give; for the laborer is worthy of his hire; go not from house to house.  

8. And whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you;

9. and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them: The kingdom of God has come near to you.

10. But whatever city you enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of it, and say:

11. Even the dust of your city, which cleaves to us, we do wipe off against you; yet know this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.

12. I say to you, It shall be more tolerable, in that day, for Sodom, than for that city.

13. Alas for thee, Chorazin! alas for thee, Bethsaida! for, if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. But for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment, than for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, who hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hades.

16. He that hears you, hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects him that sent me.  

17. And the seventy returned with joy, and said: Lord, even the demons are subject to us through thy name.

18. And he said to them: I saw Satan, like lightning from heaven, falling.

19. Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and authority over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

20. However, rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.  

21. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said: I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.

22. All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.  

23. And he turned to his disciples, and said privately: Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.

24. For I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.  

25. And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up to tempt him, and said: Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

26. He said to him: What is written in the law? How do you read?

27. He answered and said: You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole strength, and with your whole understanding, and your neighbor as yourself.

28. He said to him: You have answered correctly; do this, and you shall live.  

29. But, wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus: And who is my neighbor?

30. And Jesus answered and said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among; robbers, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and went away, leaving him half dead.

31. And by chance a certain priest went down along that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

32. In like manner, also, a Levite, when he came to the place, went and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, who was on a journey, came near him; and when he saw him, he had compassion on him.

34. And he went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and he put him on his own beast, and carried him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. And on the morrow, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him: Take care of him; and whatever you spend more, on my return, I will repay you.  

36. Which, then, of these three do you think was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers?

37. He replied: He that showed mercy to him. Jesus said to him: Go, and do you likewise.  

38. And it came to pass, as they continued their journey, that he entered a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

39. And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the feet of Jesus, and heard his word.

40. But Martha made herself busy with much serving; and she came to him, and said: Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her, therefore, that she help me.

41. But Jesus answered and said to her: Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things:

42. one thing is needful; and Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.   

## Luke 11

1. And it came to pass, as he was in a certain place praying, that, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

2. And he said to them: When you pray, say, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.

3. Give us, day by day, the bread sufficient for our support;

4. and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  

5. And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

6. for a friend of mine, who is on a journey, has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?

7. And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not; the door is already closed, and my children and myself are in bed; I can not rise and give you.

8. I say to you, Although he will not arise and give him, because he is his friend, yet, on account of his importunity, he will arise and give him as many as he needs.

9. And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

10. For every one that asks, receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, it shall be opened.  

11. If a son ask bread of any one of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he, instead of a fish, give him a serpent?

12. Or if he ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

13. If, then, you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?  

14. And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it came to pass, when the demon had gone out, that the dumb man spoke: and the multitudes wondered.

15. But some of them said: He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.

16. And others, that they might tempt him, asked of him a sign from heaven.

17. But, knowing their purpose, he said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolation; and a house that is divided against a house, falls.

18. If Satan be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say, that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.

19. But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they shall be your judges.

20. But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then has the kingdom of God already come upon you.  

21. When the strong man armed keeps guard over his palace, his goods are in peace;

22. but when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.

23. He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathers not with me, scatters.  

24. When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house out of which I came.

25. And he comes and finds it swept, and set in order.

26. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits, more wicked than himself, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

27. And it came to pass, that, when he said these things, a certain woman from among the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him: Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts that thou didst suck.

28. And he said: Yes, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.  

29. And when the multitudes were crowded together, he began to say: This is an evil generation; it asks for a sign, and no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.

30. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of man shall also be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them; for she came from the most distant parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, something greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it; for they repented in accordance with the preaching of Jonah; and lo, something greater than Jonah is here.  

33. No one, when he has lighted a lamp, puts it in a secret place, nor under the measure, but upon the lamp-stand, that those who come in may see the light.

34. The lamp of the body is the eye; when, therefore, your eye is sound, your whole body also is light; but if it be diseased, your body also is dark.

35. Take heed, therefore, lest the light that is in you be darkness.

36. If, therefore, your whole body is light, having no part dark, the whole shall be light, as when a lamp, by its brightness, gives you light.  

37. And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went in and reclined at table.

38. And when the Pharisee saw it, he wondered that he had not first immersed himself before dinner.

39. And the Lord said to him: Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.

40. Senseless men, did not he who made the outside, make the inside also?

41. But give as charity the contents of the cup, and behold, all things are clean for you.  

42. But alas for you, Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass by the justice and the love of God; these you ought to have done, and those you ought not to have left undone.

43. Alas for you, Pharisees! for you love the chief seat in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

44. Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like graves that are not seen; and men that walk over them know it not.  

45. And one of the lawyers answered and said to him: Teacher, in saying these things, you reproach us also.

46. He replied: Alas for you, lawyers, also! for you bind upon men burdens hard to be borne, and you yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers,

47. Alas for you! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. Therefore you attest and approve the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchers.

49. For this reason also the Wisdom of God said: I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill, and persecute,

50. that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

51. from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the temple; yes, I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.

52. Alas for you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not go in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you prevented.  

53. And when he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very angry, and to put questions to him about many things,

54. trying to entrap him, and seeking to lay hold on something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.   

## Luke 12

1. In the mean time, when myriads of the people had come together, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first of all: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For there is nothing covered, which shall not be revealed, and hid, which shall not be made known.

3. Wherefore, what you have spoken in the darkness, shall be heard in the light; and what you have spoken in the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.  

4. But I say to you, my friends, Fear not them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

5. But I will show you whom you shall fear: Fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, Fear him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? yet not one of them is forgotten before God.

7. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.  

8. And I further say to you, Whoever confesses me before men, him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.

9. But he that denies me before men, shall be denied before the angels of God.

10. And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but he that speaks impiously against the Holy Spirit, shall not be forgiven.

11. When they bring you to the synagogues, and to rulers and authorities, be not anxious how or what you shall answer, or what you shall say;

12. for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour what you ought to say.  

13. And a certain one of the multitude said to him: Teacher, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

14. But he said to him: Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

15. And he said to them: Take heed and beware of covetousness; for a man’s life depends not on the abundance of his possessions.  

16. And he spoke a parable to them, saying: The farm of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.

17. And he reasoned within himself, saying: What shall I do? for I have no place in which I can store my fruits.

18. And he said: This will I do: I will pull down my barns and I will build larger ones; and there I will store ail my produce, and my good things;

19. and I will say to my soul: Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.

20. But God said to him: Senseless man, this night shall your soul be required of you; and who shall have the things which you have provided?

21. So is he that lays up treasure for him self, and is not rich toward God.  

22. And he said to his disciples: For this reason I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you shall eat; nor for your body, what you shall put on.

23. Life is a greater gift than food, and the body, than clothing.

24. Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; which have neither storehouse nor granary; yet God feeds them: you are of far more value than the birds.

25. Which of you, by his anxiety, can add one span to his life?

26. If, therefore, you can not do that which is the least, why are you anxious about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow. They toil not, they spin not; yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.

28. If, then, God so clothes the herb of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?  

29. And seek not what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, and be not in anxious suspense.

30. For all these things the nations of the world seek after; but your Father knows that you have need of these things.

31. But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be given you in addition.

32. Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell what you have, and be charitable. Make for yourselves purses that do not become old, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where no thief comes near, and no moth corrupts.

34. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  

35. Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning;

36. and be like men that are waiting for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that, when he comes and knocks, they may open for him immediately.

37. Blessed are those servants whom their lord, when he comes, shall find watching. Verily I say to you, That he will gird himself and make them recline at table, and will come forth and serve them.

38. And if he shall come in the second watch, and if he shall come in the third watch, and find them thus, blessed are those servants.

39. But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief comes, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.

40. Be you, therefore, ready also; for at an hour when you think not, the Son of man comes.  

41. Then Peter said to him: Lord, dost them speak this parable to us, or also to all?

42. And the Lord said: Who, then, is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his servants, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?

43. Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when he comes, shall find so doing.

44. Of a truth, I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.

45. But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to strike the men-servants and the maid-servants, and to eat and to drink, and to be drunk;

46. the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he looks not for him, and at an hour which he knows not; and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.  

47. And that servant who knew his lord’s will, but made no preparation, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;

48. but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. To whomever much has been given, of him shall much be required; and to whom men have intrusted much, of him will they ask the more.  

49. I have come to send fire on the earth; and how greatly do I wish that it were already kindled!

50. I have an immersion with which to be immersed, and how distressed I am till it be accomplished!

51. Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I toll you, No; but rather dissension.

52. For from this time forth there shall be five in one house at variance, three with two, and two with three.

53. The father shall be at variance with the son, and the son with the father; the mother with the daughter, and the daughter with the mother; the mother-in-law with her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law.  

54. And he said also to the multitudes: When you see the cloud rising from the west, you immediately say, There comes a shower: and so it is.

55. And when the south wind blows, you say, There will be heat: and it comes to pass.

56. Hypocrites, you know how to judge of the face of the earth, and of the heavens; but how is it that you do not judge of this time?  

57. And why even of yourselves do you not judge what is right?

58. For when you are going with your opponent at law to the ruler, while you are on the way, endeavor to be delivered from him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the collector, and the collector throw you into prison.

59. I say to you, You shall not come out thence, till you have paid the very last mite.   

## Luke 13

1. And there were present, at that time, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

2. And Jesus answered and said to them: Do you think that those Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things?

3. I tell you, No; but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.

4. Or, those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were greater debtors than all other men that were living in Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, No; but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.  

6. And he spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree that was planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.

7. Then he said to his vine-dresser, Behold, for three years I have come and sought fruit on this fig-tree, and I have found none; cut it down; why does it occupy the ground unprofitably?

8. But he answered and said to him, Sir, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and throw in manure;

9. and it may bear fruit; but if not, afterward you shall cut it down.  

10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

11. And, behold, there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and was not able to raise herself up at all.

12. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her: Woman, you are released from your infirmity.

13. And he laid his hands on her; and she immediately stood erect, and glorified God.  

14. But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had performed a cure on the sabbath-day, answered and said to the multitude: There are six days in which work ought to be done; on these, therefore, come and be cured, and not on the sabbath-day. Then the Lord answered him and said:

15. Hypocrites, does not each one of you, on the sabbath, loose his ox or his ass from the stable, and lead him away, and give him water?

16. And ought not this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?

17. And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed; and all the multitude rejoiced on account of all the glorious things that were done by him.  

18. Then he said: To what is the kingdom of God like; and to what shall I liken it?

19. It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took, and sowed in his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the birds of the air roosted in its branches.  

20. And again he said: To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.  

22. And he went through every city and village, teaching, and journeying to Jerusalem.  

23. And a certain man said to him: Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said to them:

24. Strive to enter in through the strait gate; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

25. When once the master of the house has risen, and closed the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open for us, and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not, whence you are;

26. then, you will begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

27. And he shall say, I tell you, I know you not, whence you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.

28. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but your selves cast out.

29. And they shall come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and shall recline at table in the kingdom of God.

30. And behold, there are last that shall be first, and there arc first that shall be last.  

31. On the same day, certain Pharisees came and said to him: Depart, and get away from this place; for Herod intends to kill you.

32. And he said to them: Go and toll that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I finish the work.

33. But I must continue my journey to-day and to-morrow and the day following; for it is not possible that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

34. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent to thee: how often have I desired to gather thy children together, as a bird gathers her young under her wings, and you refused.

35. Behold, your house is deserted; and I say to you, You shall not see me till the time come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.   

## Luke 14

1. And it came to pass, that he went, on the sabbath-day, into the house of one of the chief men of the Pharisees, to eat bread; and they watched him.

2. And behold, there was a man before him, who had the dropsy.

3. And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath-day?

4. But they were silent. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.

5. And he answered and said to them: Which of you, if his son or his ox should fall into a pit, would not immediately pull him out on the sabbath-day?

6. And they were not able to give him an answer to these things.  

7. And he spoke a parable to those who had been invited, when he observed how they were choosing the first places at table; and he said to them:

8. When you are invited by any one to a wedding, do not recline in the first place, lest a more honorable man than you may have been invited by him;

9. and he that invited you and him, come and say to you, Give place to this man; and then you shall begin with shame to take the last place.

10. But when you are invited, go and recline in the last place, that when he that invited you shall come, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you shall have honor in the presence of those who recline with you.

11. For every one that exalts himself shall be humbled; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.  

12. Then he said also to him that had invited him: When you make a dinner or a supper, call not your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor your rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and a recompense be made you.

13. But when you make a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind;

14. and you shall be blessed; for they have no power to repay you; but you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.  

15. And a certain one of those who reclined at table with him, after hearing these things, said to him: Blessed is he who shall cat bread in the kingdom of God.

16. And he said to him: A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.

17. And he sent his servant at the hour of supper, to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all things are now ready.

18. And they all, with one consent, began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a farm, and I must go and see it; I pray you, have me excused.

19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them; I pray you, have me excused.

20. And another said, I have married a wife, and, for this reason, I can not come.

21. And that servant came and told his lord these things.   Then the master of the house was angry, and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and the maimed, the lame and the blind.

22. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you commanded, and yet there is room.

23. And the lord said to his servant, Go out into the roads, and among the hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be full.

24. For I say to you, that not one of those men who have been invited, shall taste of my supper.  

25. And many multitudes were journeying with him; and he turned and said to them:

26. If any one comes to me, and hates not his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and his own life also, he can not be my disciple.

27. And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, can not be my disciple.

28. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down, and count the cost, whether he has the means to finish it?

29. Lest, when he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all that see it begin to deride him,

30. saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.  

31. Or, what king, going to make war against another king, does not first sit down, and deliberate whether he is able, with ten thousand, to meet him that is coming; against him with twenty thousand?

32. And if not, while he is yet at a distance, he sends an embassy, and asks for conditions of peace.

33. So, then, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has, can not be my disciple.

34. Salt is good; but if the salt become tasteless, by what means shall it become salt again?

35. It is fit neither for earth, nor for manure; but they cast it out. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.   

## Luke 15

1. And all the publicans and the sinners came near to him to hear him.

2. And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receives sinners, and eats with them.  

3. And he spoke this parable to them, saying:

4. What man of you that has a hundred sheep, and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which is lost, till he find it?

5. And when he finds it, he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, and says to them., Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.

7. I say to you, That thus there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety-nine just persons, who need no repentance.  

8. Or, what woman that has ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she find it?

9. And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma that I lost.

10. So, I say to you, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.  

11. Then he said: A certain man had two sons.

12. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of the property that falls to me. And he divided his estate between them.

13. And not many days after, the younger son, taking with him all that was his, left home for a distant country, and there wasted his property in riotous living.

14. When he had spent all, there was a great famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want.

15. And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.

16. And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods which the swine did eat. And no one gave to him.  

17. But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!

18. I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight,

19. and am no longer worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired servants.

20. And he arose, and came to his father. And while he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion on him, and ran and fell upon his neck, and kissed him.

21. But his son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.

22. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet.

23. And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;

24. for this my son was dead, and is alive again: he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.  

25. But his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. And he called to him one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.

27. And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him in health.

28. And he was angry, and would not go in. Then his father went out and entreated him.

29. But he answered and said to his father, Behold, for so many years do I serve you, and never have I transgressed your commandment, and yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.

30. But as soon as this your son has come, Who has eaten up your estate with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf.

31. And he said to him, Son, you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours.

32. But it became us to make merry and rejoice; for this your brother was dead, and is alive again: was lost, and is found.   

## Luke 16

1. And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he was accused to him of wasting his goods.

2. And he called him, and said to him: What is this that I hear of you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer act as steward.

3. And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes from me the stewardship. I have not strength to dig; I am ashamed to beg.

4. I am resolved on what I shall do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, I may be received into their houses.  

5. And he called to him every one of his lord’s debtors, and said to the first, How much do you owe my lord?

6. He replied, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take back your note, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

7. Then he said to another, How much do you owe? He replied, A hundred homers of wheat. And he said to him, Take back your note, and write eighty.

8. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he acted prudently. For the children of this age are more prudent toward their generation than the children of light.  

9. And I say to you, Make for yourselves friends with the unrighteous riches, that when you fail, you may be received into the everlasting habitations.

10. He that is faithful in the least, is faithful also in much. He that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.

11. If, therefore, you have not been faithful in the unrighteous riches, who will intrust you with the true?

12. And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give to you that which is your own?

13. No servant can serve two masters; for he will either hate the one, and love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and despise the other. You can not serve God and riches.  

14. And the Pharisees also, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.

15. And he said to them: You set yourselves forth as righteous before men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men, is detestable in the sight of God.

16. The law and the prophets were till John. Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached, and every one enters it by force.

17. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one point of the law to fail.

18. Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her that is divorced, commits adultery.  

19. There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day.

20. And there was a certain poor man named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores:

21. and he would gladly have been fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. And even the dogs came and licked his sores.

22. And it came to pass, that the poor man died, and was carried by angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried;

23. and in hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.  

24. And he called to him and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that, in your lifetime, you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus his evil things. But now he is comforted, and you are tormented.

26. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that they that would pass hence to you, can not; nor can they that would, pass thence to us.  

27. Then he said, I beseech you, therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house;

28. for I have five brothers; that he may earnestly admonish them, lest they also come to this place of torment.

29. Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

30. But he said, Not so, Father Abraham; but if one should go to them from the dead, they would repent.

31. But he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded, though one should rise from the dead.   

## Luke 17

1. Then he said to his disciples: It is impossible that causes of offense should not come; but alas for him by whom they come!

2. It would be better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.

3. Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sin against you, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

4. And if he sin against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you and say, I repent, you shall forgive him.  

5. And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.

6. And the Lord said: If you had faith like a grain of mustard, you might say to this sycamine-tree, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it should obey you.  

7. Which of you that has a servant plowing, or feeding a flock, will say to him immediately, when he comes in from the field, Go and recline at table?

8. But will he not say to him, Make ready my supper, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunk; and afterward, you shall eat and drink?

9. Does he thank that servant, because he did what was commanded? I think not.

10. So also you, when you shall have done all things that you arc commanded to do, say, We are unprofitable servants; for we have done what was our duty to do.  

11. And it came to pass, as he was journeying to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And as he entered a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood at a distance.

13. And they lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

14. And when he saw them, he said to them: Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were made clean.  

15. But, one of them, seeing that he was restored to health, turned back, and, with a loud voice, glorified God.

16. And he fell on his face at his feet, and gave him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.

17. And Jesus answered and said: Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?

18. Were there none found to return and give glory to God, but this one of another race?

19. And he said to him: Arise, and go; your faith has saved you.  

20. And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said: The kingdom of God comes not so as to attract attention;

21. nor shall it be said, Lo here! or Lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is among you.  

22. And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.

23. And they shall say to you, Lo here! or Lo there! go not after them, nor follow them.

24. For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven, shines to another part under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.

25. But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.  

26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day in which Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

28. In like manner also, as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

29. but in the day in which Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

30. Even thus shall it be in the day in which the Son of man is revealed.  

31. In that day, let not him that is on the house-top, and whose goods are in the house, come down to take them away. Likewise, he that is in the field, let him not turn back.

32. Remember Lot’s wife.

33. Whoever will seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever will lose his life, shall save it.

34. I say to you, on that night two men shall be in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

35. Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

36. Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

37. And they answered and said to him. Where, Lord? And he said to them: Where the body is, there will the vultures be gathered.   

## Luke 18

1. And he spoke a parable to them, that they ought always to pray, and not to become weary,

2. saying: There was in a certain city a judge, who neither feared God nor regarded man.

3. And there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, and said: Avenge me on my opponent at law.

4. And for a while he refused. But afterward he said within himself: Though I fear not God, nor regard man,

5. yet, because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.  

6. And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge says;

7. and will not God avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night, though he delay long in respect to them?

8. I say to you, that he will avenge them speedily. Yet, when the Son of man comes, will he find the faith on the earth?  

9. And he spoke this parable to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and who despised others.

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

11. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.

12. I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.

13. And the publican, standing afar off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying: God, be merciful to me a sinner.

14. I say to you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For every one that exalts himself, shall be humbled; but he that humbles himself, shall be exalted.  

15. And they brought to him infants also, that he might touch them. But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

16. And Jesus called them to him, and said: Let the little children come to me, and hinder them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child, shall in no way enter into it.  

18. And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

19. And Jesus said to him: Why do you call me good? None is good but one, that is God.

20. You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery; Do not kill; Do not steal; Do not bear false testimony; Honor your father and your mother.

21. He replied: All these have I kept from my youth.

22. When Jesus heard this, he said to him: One thing you yet lack; sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

23. And when he heard this, he was very sad, for he was very rich.  

24. When Jesus saw that he was very sad, he said: How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

25. For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom, of God.

26. And those who heard it said: Who, then, can be saved?

27. He replied: Things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.  

28. Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all and followed thee.

29. And he said to them: Verily I say to you, There is no one that has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come, eternal life.  

31. And he took the twelve aside, and said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.:

32. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be derided and insulted and spit upon;

33. and they shall scourge him, and put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.

34. And they understood none of these things; and this saying was concealed from them; and they understood not the things that were spoken.  

35. And it came to pass, that, as he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road begging.

36. And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.

37. And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.

38. And he cried out and said: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.

39. And those who went before rebuked him, that he should be silent. But he cried so much the more: Son of David, have mercy on me.  

40. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,

41. saying: What do you wish me to do for you? he replied: Lord, that I may receive my sight.

42. And Jesus said to him: Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.

43. And he immediately received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.   

## Luke 19

1. And he entered, and passed through Jericho.

2. And, behold, there was a man called Zacchæus, who was a chief publican; and he was rich.

3. And he sought to see Jesus, who he was, and was not able on account of the multitude, because he was of small stature.

4. And he ran before, and climbed up a sycamore-tree, that he might see him, for he was about to pass that way.

5. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him: Zacchæus, make haste and come down, for I must spend this day at your house.

6. And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.  

7. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying: He has gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

8. And Zacchæus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken from any one by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him: To-day has salvation come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.  

11. And as they heard these things, he also spoke a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.

12. He said, therefore: A certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

13. And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, Engage in trade till I come.

14. But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.  

15. And it came to pass, that, when he had returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded those servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what each had gained by trading.

16. And the first came and said: Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.

17. And he said to him: Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.

18. And the second came and said: Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.

19. And he said to him also: And be you over five cities.

20. And another came and said: Lord, behold your pound, which I have kept laid away in a napkin.

21. For I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man; you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.  

22. Then he said to him: Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow.

23. And why then did you not put my money into the bank, that, when I came, I could have collected it with interest?

24. And he said to those who stood by: Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.

25. And they said to him: Lord, he has ten pounds.

26. For I say to you, To every one that has, it shall be given; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away.

27. But those who are my enemies, who were not willing that I should rule over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

28. And when he had said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.  

29. And it came to pass, that, when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

30. saying: Go into the opposite village, in which, when you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Loose him, and bring him.

31. And if any one ask you why you loose him, thus shall you say to him: The Lord has need of him.  

32. And those who were sent, went, and found as he had said to them.

33. And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of him said to them: Why do you loose the colt?

34. They replied: The Lord has need of him.

35. And they brought him to Jesus, and threw their mantles upon the colt, and set Jesus on him.

36. And as he was going on, they spread their mantles in the road.

37. And when he was now near the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God, with a loud voice, for all the mighty deeds which they had seen,

38. saying: Blessed is the king that comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

39. And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude, said to him: Teacher, rebuke your disciples.

40. And he answered, and said to them: I say to you, that if these had been silent, the stones would have cried out.  

41. And when he came near, he looked upon the city, and wept over it,

42. saying: Hadst thou known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which were for thy peace! But now, they are hid from thy eyes.

43. For the days will come upon thee, when thy enemies will throw up a mound about thee, and inclose thee around, and keep thee in on every side,

44. and will destroy thee and thy children within thee, and will not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.  

45. And he went into the temple, and began to drive out those who were selling in it, and those who were buying,

46. and said to them: It is written, My house is a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.  

47. And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

48. and found nothing that they could do, for all the people hung on his words.   

## Luke 20

1. And it came to pass, that, on one of those days, while he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came to him,

2. and spoke to him, saying: Tell us by what authority you do these things? or, who is he that gave you this authority?

3. And he answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, and do you answer me.

4. Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men?

5. And they reasoned among themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will reply: Why, then, did you not believe him?

6. But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they believe that John was a prophet.

7. And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.

8. And Jesus said to them: Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things.  

9. And he began to speak this parable to the people: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to vine-dressers, and was absent from home for a long time.

10. And at the proper season, he sent a servant to those vine-dressers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vine-dressers scourged him, and sent him away empty-handed.

11. And he then sent another servant. But they scourged him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.

12. And he also sent a third; but they wounded him, and drove him out.  

13. And the owner of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps, when they see him, they will reverence him.

14. But when the vine-dressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

15. And they drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

16. He will come and destroy these vine-dressers, and will give his vineyard to others.   And when they heard it, they said: Be it not so!

17. And he looked on them and said: What, then, does this mean, which is written, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?

18. Whoever shall fall on this stone, shall be dashed to pieces; but on whomever it shall fall, it will make him as chaff for the wind.

19. And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him, the same hour; (and yet they feared the people;) for they knew that he spoke this parable against them.  

20. And they watched him, and sent spies, who feigned them selves to be just men, that they might take hold of his words, in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.

21. And they asked him, saying: Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not regard the person of any, but teach the way of God in truth.

22. Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?

23. But he perceived their cunning, and said to them: Why do you tempt me?

24. Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said: Cæsar’s.

25. He said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.

26. And they were not able to take hold of his words before the people. And they were astonished at his answer, and were silent.  

27. Then there came to him some of the Sadducees, (these deny that there is any resurrection,) and asked him,

28. saying: Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.

29. There were, therefore, seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children;

30. and the second took his wife, and he died without children;

31. and the third took her; and in like manner also the seven; and they left no children, and died.

32. Last of all, the woman also died.

33. Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her as a wife.  

34. And Jesus answered and said to them: The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.

35. But those who shall be accounted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.

36. For they can die no more; for they are like the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.

37. But: that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at The Bush, since he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. He is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him.

39. And certain of the scribes answered and said: Teacher, thou hast answered well.

40. And after this they durst not ask him any question at all.  

41. But he said to them: How say they that the Christ is the son of David?

42. Even David himself says, in the book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,

43. till I make thy enemies thy footstool.

44. David, therefore, calls him Lord; and how is he his son?  

45. And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples:

46. Beware of the scribes, who delight to walk in robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first places at suppers;

47. who eat up the houses of widows, and, for a pretext, make long prayers. These shall receive the greater condemnation.   

## Luke 21

1. And he looked up, and saw the rich throwing their gifts into the treasury.

2. And he saw also a certain poor widow throw in thither two mites.

3. And he said: Of a truth, I say to you, that this poor widow has thrown in more than they all.

4. For all these, from their abundance, have thrown in among the gifts of God; but she, from her poverty, has thrown in all the living that she had.  

5. And as some were saying of the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he said:

6. As for these things which you see, the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

7. And they asked him, saying: Teacher, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when these things come to pass?

8. He replied: Take heed that you be not deceived; for many will come in my name, saying: I am he; and, The time is near. Go not, therefore, after them.

9. But when you hear of wars, and tumults, be not terrified; for these things must first take place; but the end comes not immediately.

10. Then he said to them: Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;

11. and there shall be great earthquakes in various places, and famines, and pestilences; and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.  

12. But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues, and into prisons, after being brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake.

13. But this shall become to you the means of bearing testimony.

14. Therefore, determine in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what you shall answer;

15. for I will give you a mouth, and wisdom, which all your opposers shall not be able to gainsay or withstand.

16. But you will be delivered up by parents and brothers and relatives and friends; and some of you they will put to death;

17. and you will be hated by all for my name’s sake.

18. Yet a hair of your head shall not perish.

19. By your patient endurance, preserve your lives.  

20. But when you shall see Jerusalem besieged by armies, then know that its desolation is near.

21. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let those who are in the midst of it, withdraw from it. Let those who are in the count try, not come within it.

22. For these are the days of vengeance, that all things that are written may be fulfilled.

23. But alas for them that are with child, and for them that give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath upon this people.

24. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive among all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.  

25. And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and on the earth, distress of nations in perplexity; the sea and its waves roaring;

26. men’s hearts failing on account of the fearful expectation of the things that are coming on the land; for the hosts of the heavens shall be shaken.

27. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28. When these things begin to take place, look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.  

29. And he spoke a parable to them: See the fig-tree, and all the trees;

30. when they now put forth leaves, you see, and know of yourselves that summer is near.

31. So likewise, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.

32. Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled.

33. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  

34. And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts become heavy with reveling and drunkenness and the cares of life, and that day come upon you when you look not for it.

35. For as a snare, it shall come on all that dwell on the face of all the land.

36. Watch, therefore, and pray at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.  

37. And in the day-time he was teaching in the temple. But he went out and passed the nights in the mount called the mount of Olives.

38. And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, in order to hear him.   

## Luke 22

1. Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the passover, was at hand.

2. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.

3. But Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.

4. And he went away, and conferred with the chief priests and the captains how he might deliver him up to them.

5. And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.

6. And he consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them without tumult.  

7. Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.

8. And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, make ready the passover for us, that we may eat it.

9. They said to him: Where dost thou wish that we make it ready?

10. And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters;

11. and say to the master of the house: The Teacher says to you, Where is the room in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?

12. And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.

13. And they went, and found as he had said to them; and they made ready the passover.  

14. And when the hour had come, he reclined at table, and the twelve apostles with him.

15. And he said to them: I have greatly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.

16. For I say to you, I will eat of it no more till it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said: Take this, and divide it among yourselves;

18. for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of God has come.  

19. And he took bread, and gave thanks; and he broke, and gave it to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you: do this in remembrance of me.

20. In like manner also, the cup, after he had supped, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.  

21. But, behold, the hand of him that delivers me up is with me on the table.

22. And the Son of man goes, as it is determined; but alas for that man by whom he is delivered up.

23. And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it could be that was about to do this thing.  

24. And there had been also a contention among them, which of them was thought to be the greatest.

25. And he said to them: The kings of the nations have dominion over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.

26. But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you be as the younger, and him that is chief, as he that serves.

27. For which is greater, he that reclines at table, or he that serves? Is not he that reclines at table? But I am among you as one that serves.

28. You are they that have continued with me in my trials;

29. and I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed to me,

30. that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  

31. And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded you apostles for himself, that he may sift you as wheat.

32. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith fail not. And when you have turned to me again, strengthen your brethren.

33. And he said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both to prison and to death.

34. He replied: I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before you have three times denied that you know me.  

35. And he said to them: When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, did you need any thing? They replied: Nothing.

36. Then he said to them: But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he that has no sword, let him sell his mantle and buy one.

37. For I say to you, That even this which is written must be fulfilled in me: And he was numbered with transgressors. For the things concerning me have an end.

38. And they said: Lord, behold, here are two swords. He said to them: It is enough.  

39. And after he had gone out, he went, according to custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.

40. And when he came to the place, he said to them: Pray, that you enter not into temptation.

41. And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and kneeled down, and prayed,

42. saying: Father, if thou art willing that this cup should pass from me―yet, not my will, but thine be done.  

43. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, to strengthen him.

44. And he was in agony, and prayed more earnestly. And his sweat was like great drops of blood falling to the ground.

45. And he arose from prayer, and came to his disciples, and found them asleep for sorrow.

46. And he said to them: Why do you sleep? Arise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.  

47. And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and came near to Jesus to kiss him.

48. But Jesus said to him: Judas, do you deliver up the Son of man with a kiss?

49. When those who were about him saw what would be done, they said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

50. And a certain one of them struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. And Jesus answered and said: Let this matter proceed thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him.  

52. And Jesus said to the chief priests, and the captains of the temple, and the elders that had come against him: Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber?

53. While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.

54. And they took him, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the chief priest.   But Peter followed at a distance.

55. And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.

56. And a certain maid-servant saw him sitting by the fire; and, looking intently at him, she said: This man also was with him.

57. But he denied, saying: Woman, I know him not.

58. And after a little, another saw him, and said: You also are one of them. Peter replied: Man, I am not.

59. And about one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.

60. But Peter said: Man, I know not what you say. And immediately, while he was speaking, the cock crew.

61. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, that he had said to him, Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.

62. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.  

63. And the men that had Jesus in custody mocked him, and smote him.

64. And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying: Give a response; who is it that struck you?

65. And many other impious things they said to him.  

66. And when it was day, the elders of the people, the chief priests also and scribes, met together, and led him up to the Sanhedrin, and said:

67. If you are the Christ, tell us. But he said to them: If I tell you, you will not believe;

68. and if I also ask you a question, you will not answer me, nor let me go.

69. Henceforth the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God.

70. And they all said: You are, then, the Son of God? He said to them: You say that I am.

71. They replied: What further need have we of testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.   

## Luke 23

1. And the whole number of them arose, and led him away to Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse him, saying: We found this man turning the people away, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.

3. And Pilate asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? He answered and said to him: You say it.

4. Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no fault in this man.

5. But they became the more urgent, and said: He excites the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.

6. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the man was a Galilean.  

7. And when he learned that he belonged to the dominion of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was at that time in Jerusalem.

8. When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly; for he had, for a long time, desired to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign done by him.

9. And he questioned him concerning many things; but he made him no answer.

10. And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, and vehemently accused him.

11. But Herod and his guards treated him with contempt; and having mocked him, and put on him a gaudy robe, he sent him back to Pilate.

12. And on the same day, Pilate and Herod became friends to each other; for, before this, they had been at enmity the one toward the other.  

13. And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

14. and said to them: You have brought to me this man as one that turns the people away; and behold, I have examined him before you, and have found in this man no fault, with respect to the things of which you accuse him;

15. nor indeed did Herod; for I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.

16. I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him.  

17. For it was necessary that he should release to them one at the feast.

18. And the whole multitude cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.

19. He, for a certain seditious movement that had been made in the city, and for murder, had been thrown into prison.

20. Therefore Pilate, desiring to release Jesus, again called to them.

21. But they answered, saying: Crucify, crucify him.

22. He said to them the third time: Why, what evil has he done? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him.

23. But they were urgent with loud voices, demanding that he should be crucified. And their voices, and those of the chief priests, prevailed.

24. And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they demanded.

25. And he released him that for a seditious movement, and for murder, had been thrown into prison, whom they demanded; but Jesus, he delivered up to their will.  

26. And as they led him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it after Jesus.

27. And there followed him a great number of the people, and of women that bewailed and lamented him.

28. But Jesus turned, and said to them, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

29. For, behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck.

30. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.

31. For, if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?  

32. And two others, who were evil-doers, were led out to be put to death with him.

33. And when they came to the place called Skull, they there crucified him and the evil-doers; one on the right, and the other on the left.

34. And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And dividing his clothing into parts, they cast lots.

35. And the people stood and looked on. And the rulers, with them scoffed at him, saying: He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.

36. The soldiers also derided him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,

37. and saying: If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.

38. And a superscription was also written over him in Greek and in Roman and in Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  

39. And one of the evil-doers that were hanged reviled him, saying: If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.

40. But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Do you not fear God, since you are in the same condemnation?

41. And we justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.

42. And he said to Jesus: Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom.

43. And Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, to-day you shall be with me in paradise.  

44. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land till the ninth hour.

45. And the sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.

46. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And when he had said this, he gave up his spirit.  

47. When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying: Truly, this was a righteous man.

48. And all the multitudes that had come together to that sight, when they saw what was done, returned, smiting their breasts.

49. And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance looking on these things.  

50. And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor, a good and a just man;

51. (he had not given his consent to their counsel and deed;) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he himself also waited for the kingdom of God:

52. this man came to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.

53. And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that had been hewed in rock, in which no one had yet been laid.

54. And the day was the preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.  

55. And the women that had come with him from Galilee followed after and saw the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.

56. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointment; and they rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.   

## Luke 24

1. And on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and with them came certain others.

2. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher;

3. and they entered in, but found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it came to pass, while they were much perplexed at this, behold, two men stood by them in shining raiment.

5. And while they feared and bowed their faces to the earth, they said to them: Why seek you among the dead for him that lives?

6. He is not here, but he has risen; remember that he spoke to you while he was yet in Galilee,

7. saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.  

8. And they remembered his words,

9. and returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven and to the rest.

10. It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, and the others with them, that told these things to the apostles.

11. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

12. But Peter arose and ran to the sepulcher, and stooping down, he saw the linen clothes lying by themselves; and he departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.  

13. And, behold, two of them were going, on the same day, to a village called Emmaus, distant from Jerusalem sixty furlongs.

14. And they were talking to one another about all these things which had taken place.

15. And it came to pass, that, while they conversed and reasoned together, Jesus himself drew near, and went on with them.

16. But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not recognize him.

17. And he said to them: What matters are these which you are discussing with one another as you walk and are sad?  

18. And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to him: Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things that have taken place there in these days?

19. And he said to them: What things? They said to him: The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people;

20. and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.

21. But we trusted that it was he that was about to redeem Israel. And besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.

22. And further, certain women of our company, who were early at the sepulcher, astonished us:

23. for they found not his body, and came and told that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.

24. And some of those who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even as the women had said, but him they saw not.  

25. And he said to them: O inconsiderate, and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets have spoken!

26. Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

27. And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, he explained to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himself.

28. And they drew near the village to which they were going; and he made as if he would go further.

29. And they constrained him, saying: Remain with us, for it is near the evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.  

30. And it came to pass, while he reclined at table with them, that he took bread and blessed; and he broke, and gave it to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he disappeared from them.

32. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?  

33. And they arose the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven, and those who were with them, assembled,

34. and saying: The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.

35. And they told what had taken place on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.  

36. And while they were speaking of these things, Jesus him self stood in the midst of them, and said to them: Peace be to you.

37. But they were terrified and frightened, and thought that they saw a spirit.

38. And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?

39. See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.

40. And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.

41. And while they did not believe as yet for joy, and were astonished, he said to them: Have you any thing here to eat?

42. And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.

43. And he took it, and did eat before them.  

44. And he said to them: These are the words that I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled that are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.

45. Then he opened their mind, that they might understand the scriptures,

46. and he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus was it necessary that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day,

47. and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. You are witnesses of these things.

49. And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you. But do you remain in the city of Jerusalem, till you be clothed with power from on high.  

50. And he led them out as far as Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.

51. And it came to pass, that as he blessed them, he was separated from them, and carried up into heaven.

52. And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy;

53. and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
