# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.  

2. Abraham begot Isaac: Isaac begot Jacob: Jacob begot Judah and his brothers:

3. Judah begot Phares and Zarah of Thamar: Phares begot Hezron: Hezron begot Aram:

4. Aram begot Aminidab: Aminidab begot Nahshon: Nahshon begot Salmon:

5. Salmon begot Boa of Rachab: Boaz begot Obed of Ruth: Obed begot Jesse:

6. Jesse begot David the king: David the king begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah:

7. Solomon begot Rehoboam: Rehoboam begot Abia: Abia begot Asa:

8. Asa begot Jehosaphat: Jehosaphat begot Jehoram: Jehoram begot Uzziah:

9. Uzziah begot Jotham: Jotham begot Ahaz: Ahaz begot Hezekiah:

10. Hezekiah begot Manasseh: Manasseh begot Amon: Amon begot Josiah:

11. Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time of the removal to Babylon.  

12. And after the removal to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel: Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel:

13. Zerubbabel begot Abiud: Abiud begot Eliakim: Eliakim begot Azor:

14. Azor begot Sadok: Sadok begot Achim: Achim begot Eliud:

15. Eliud begot Eleazar: Eleazar begot Matthan: Matthan begot Jacob:

16. Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.  

17. So all the generations from Abraham till David are fourteen generations: and from David till the removal to Babylon are fourteen generations: and from the removal to Babylon till the Christ are fourteen generations.  

18. But Jesus Christ was begotten thus: After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they had come together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.

19. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not choosing to make an example of her, intended to put her away privately.

20. But while he was thinking of these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take home Mary your wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.

21. And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins.

22. Now all this was done, that the word might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:

23. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called Immanuel, which, when translated, is, God with us.

24. And Joseph awoke from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; and he took home his wife,

25. and knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son. And he called his name Jesus.   

## Matthew 2

1. Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem,

2. saying: Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage.

3. When Herod the king heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

4. And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.

5. And they said to him: In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet:

6. And thou, Bethlehem, city of Judah, art by no means the least among the chiefs of Judah; for out of thee shall come a leader, that shall be a shepherd to my people Israel.  

7. Then Herod, when he had secretly called the Magi, inquired of them strictly at what time the star, then visible, first made its appearance:

8. and sending them to Bethlehem, he said: Go, make strict inquiry for the young child: and when you have found him, bring me word, that I also may go and do him homage.

9. When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over the place where the young child was.

10. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.

11. And having come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they did him homage. And when they had opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

12. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.  

13. When they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there till I bring you word; for Herod is about to seek for the young child, to destroy him.

14. And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,

15. and was there till the death of Herod; that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through his prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have I called my Son.  

16. Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the Magi, was greatly enraged, and sent out and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem and in all its borders, from the age of two years and under, according to the time which he had strictly inquired of the Magi.

17. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

18. A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted because they are no more.  

19. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

20. saying: Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the young child’s life.

21. And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

22. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither. But being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the regions of Galilee,

23. and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets: He shall be called a Nazarene.   

## Matthew 3

1. In those days came John the Immerser, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,

2. and saying: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

3. For this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

4. But the same John had his clothing of camel’s hair, and a girdle of leather around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.  

5. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,

6. and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them: Generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coining wrath?

8. Bring forth, therefore, fruit worthy of repentance:

9. and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

10. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees: therefore, every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

11. I immerse you in water, in order to repentance; but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:

12. whose winnowing-shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his thrashing-floor, and gather his grain into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.  

13. Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be immersed by him.

14. But John forbade him, saying: I have need to be immersed by thee, and comest thou to me?

15. But Jesus answering said to him: Permit it now; for thus it becomes us to perform fully every righteous act. Then he permitted him.

16. And after Jesus was immersed, he came up immediately from the water; and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.

17. And lo, a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.   

## Matthew 4

1. Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.

2. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.

3. And the tempter came to him and said: If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.

4. But he answered and said: It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.

5. Then the devil took him into the holy city, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,

6. and said to him: If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: He will give his angels charge concerning you; and in their hands shall they take you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.

7. Jesus said to him: It is again written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof.  

8. Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,

9. and said to him: All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.

10. Then Jesus said to him: Get behind me, Satan, for it is written: You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.

11. Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.  

12. Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up; he withdrew into Galilee;

13. and, leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea, in the borders of Zebulon and Naphtali,

14. that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:

15. The land of Zebulon, and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

16. the people that sat in darkness saw great light; and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has risen.

17. From that time Jesus began to preach and to say: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  

18. And as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, throwing a net into the sea, for they were fishers.

19. And he said to them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. And they immediately left their nets and followed him.

21. And going on thence, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

22. And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.  

23. And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease, and every kind of sickness among the people.

24. And his fame went abroad into all Syria. And they brought to him all that were sick, those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were possessed with demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he cured them.

25. And many multitudes followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.   

## Matthew 5

1. And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him;

2. and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:

3. Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

4. Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.

6. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness; for they shall be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful; for they shall receive mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.

9. Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called sons of God.

10. Blessed are they that are persecuted on account of righteousness; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11. Blessed are you, when they shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, falsely, on my account.

12. Rejoice, and leap for joy; for great is your reward in heaven: for so did they persecute the prophets who were before you.  

13. You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has become tasteless, by what means shall it become salt again? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trod upon by men.

14. You are the light of the world: a city that lies upon a mountain can not be hid:

15. neither do men light a lamp and place it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all that are in the house.

16. In this way let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.  

17. Think not that I have come to make the law or the prophets of no effect. I have not come to make them of no effect, but to give them their full efficiency.

18. For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one yod or one point shall in no way pass from the law till all be fulfilled.

19. Whoever, therefore, shall make void one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

20. For I say to you, That, unless your righteousness excel that of the scribes and Pharisees, you can by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven.  

21. You have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill, shall be liable to the sentence of the judges.

22. But I say to you, Whoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be liable to the sentence of the judges. And whoever shall say to his brother, Worthless fellow, shall be liable to the sentence of the Sanhedrin. But who ever shall say, Impious wretch, shall be in danger of hell-fire.

23. If, therefore, you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has any thing against you,

24. leave your gift there before the altar, and go, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.

25. Come to an agreement with your opponent at law quickly, while you are on the road with him, lest your opponent at law deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.

26. Verily, I say to you, You shall by no means come out thence, till you have paid the last farthing.  

27. You have heard that it was said: You shall not commit adultery.

28. But I say to you, Whoever looks upon a woman to cherish desire for her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. If, then, your right eye ensnare you, tear it out, and throw it from you; for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.

30. And if your right hand ensnare you, cut it off, and throw it from you; for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.  

31. It has been said: Whoever will put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.

32. But I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, unless on account of lewdness, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever marries her that is divorced, commits adultery.

33. Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but shall pay to the Lord your vows.

34. But I say to you, Swear not at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;

35. nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King:

36. neither shall you swear by your head, for you can not make one hair white or black.

37. But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than these is of the Evil One.  

38. You have heard that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

39. But I say to you, Resist not the injurious. But whoever will smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.

40. And to him that will go to law with you, and take away your coat, give your mantle also.

41. And whoever will compel you to go one mile, go with him two.

42. Give to him that asks of you; and from him that would borrow of you, turn not away.  

43. You have heard that it was said: You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.

44. But I say to you, Love your enemies: bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you:

45. that you may be the sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and causes it to rain on the just and on the unjust.

46. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the publicans the same?

47. And if you salute your brethren only, in what do you excel? Do not even the publicans so?

48. Be you therefore perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.   

## Matthew 6

1. Beware of doing your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.

2. When, therefore, you do a charitable deed, do not cause a trumpet to be sounded before you, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.

3. But when you do a charitable deed, let not your left hand know what your right hand does;

4. that your charitable deeds may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, himself will reward you openly.  

5. And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.

6. But do you, when you pray, go into your closet, and when you have closed the door, pray to your Father who is in secret: and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.

7. But when you pray, do not use vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they will be heard for their many words.

8. Be not, therefore, like them; for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him.  

9. In this manner, therefore, pray you: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

10. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.

11. Give us this day the bread for our support.

12. And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.

13. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One.

14. For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

15. But if you forgive not men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.  

16. And when you fast, do not put on a sad countenance, as the hypocrites do; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to be fasting. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.

17. But do you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face;

18. that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.  

19. Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal.

20. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.

21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

22. The lamp of the body is the eye: if, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be light:

23. But if your eye be diseased, your whole body will be dark. If therefore, the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!  

24. No one can serve two masters: for he will either hate the one and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and riches.

25. For this reason I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you shall eat, and what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not your life a greater gift than food, and your body than clothing?

26. Observe the birds of the air, that they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into granaries. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?

27. Which of you, by his anxiety, can add one span to his life?

28. And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow: they toil not, nor do they spin.

29. But I say to you, That Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these.

30. If then, God so clothes the herb of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

31. Therefore, be not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or, with what shall we be clothed?

32. For after all these things do the Gentiles seek: for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

33. But seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you in addition.

34. Therefore, be not anxious about the morrow, for the morrow will have anxieties of its own. Sufficient for the day is its own evil.   

## Matthew 7

1. Judge not, that you may not be judged:

2. for with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.

3. And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother’s eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?

4. Or, how will you say to your brother, Let me pull out the splinter from your eye: and lo; a beam is in your own eye?

5. Hypocrite! first pull the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to pull the splinter out of your brother’s eye.  

6. Give not that which is holy to dogs, nor throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and tear you.  

7. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

8. For every one that asks, receives; and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, it shall be opened.

9. What man is there of you, of whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?

10. And if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

11. If then you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?

12. All things, therefore, whatever you would that men should do to you, even so do you to them: for this is the law and the prophets.  

13. Enter in through the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction; and many there are that go in through it.

14. How strait is the gate, and how narrow the way, that leads to life! and few there are that find it.  

15. But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but within are ravenous wolves.

16. By their fruits you will know them. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?

17. So every good tree produces goodly fruit: but an unsound tree produces diseased fruit.

18. A good tree can not produce diseased fruit; nor can an unsound tree produce goodly fruit.

19. Every tree that does not produce goodly fruit, is cut down and thrown into the fire.

20. Therefore, by their fruits you shall know them.  

21. Not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

22. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name done many mighty works?

23. And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.  

24. Therefore, whoever hears these words of mine and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on the rock:

25. and the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell not: for it was founded on the rock.

26. And every one that hears these words of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.

27. And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell: and great was its fall.  

28. And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these words, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:

29. for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.   

## Matthew 8

1. And when he had come down from the mountain, many multitudes followed him.  

2. And behold, a leper came and did him homage, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

3. And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying: I will; be clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus said to him: See that you tell no one. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.  

5. And when he entered Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,

6. and saying: Lord, my servant lies in my house, palsied, fearfully afflicted.

7. And Jesus said to him: I will go and cure him.

8. And the centurion answering, said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but say in a word only, and my servant shall be restored to health.

9. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

10. And when Jesus heard it, he was filled with admiration, and said to those who followed him: Verily I say to you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.

11. I also say to you, That many shall come from the east and the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;

12. but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast into the darkness that is without. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as you have believed, so be it to you. And his servant was restored to health in that hour.  

14. And when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying, and ill of a fever.

15. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose and ministered to him.  

16. When the evening had come, they brought to him many that were possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and cured all that were sick;

17. that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: He himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.  

18. But when Jesus saw many multitudes about him, he gave orders to depart to the other side.

19. And a certain scribe came and said to him: Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.

20. And Jesus said to him: The foxes have dens, and the birds of the air have roosts; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.

21. And another of his disciples said to him: Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.

22. But Jesus said to him: Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.  

23. And when he had entered the ship, his disciples followed him.

24. And behold, there was a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves: but he was asleep.

25. And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying: Lord, save us; we perish.

26. And he said to them: Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea: and there was a great calm.

27. But the men were astonished, and said: What man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!  

28. And when he had come to the opposite side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two men, coming out of the tombs, possessed with demons, very fierce, so that no one could pass that way.

29. And behold, they cried out, saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God? Hast thou come hither to torment us before the time?

30. Now there was, at a distance from them, a herd of many swine, feeding.

31. And the demons besought him, saying: If thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.

32. And he said to them: Go. And when they had come out, they went away into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine rushed down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.

33. And those who fed them fled, and went into the city, and told every thing, and what had happened to those who had been possessed with the demons.

34. And, behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they besought him to depart out of their borders.   

## Matthew 9

1. And he entered the ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.

2. And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the palsied man: Son, be of good courage; your sins are forgiven you.

3. And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves: This man talks impiously.

4. And Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said: Why do evil thoughts arise in your hearts?

5. For, which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?

6. But that you may know that the Son of man on earth has authority to forgive sins (then he said to the palsied man): Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.

7. And he arose, and departed to his house.

8. And when the multitude saw it, they were astonished, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.  

9. And as Jesus passed by from that place, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him: Follow me. And he arose and followed him.

10. And it came to pass that, while Jesus was reclining at table in his house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and reclined at table with him and his disciples.

11. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples: Why does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?

12. When Jesus heard it, he said to them: Those who are in health have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.

13. But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I came not to call righteous men, but sinners to repentance.  

14. Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples fast not?

15. And Jesus said to them: Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then will they fast.

16. No one puts a patch of new cloth on an old garment; for that which is put in to fill it up, takes from the garment, and a worse rent is made.

17. Nor do men put new wine into old bottles; if so, the bottles burst, and the wine runs out, and the bottles are lost. But they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

18. While he was speaking these things to them, behold, a certain ruler came and did him homage, saying: My daughter is already dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

19. And Jesus and his disciples arose and followed him.  

20. And behold, a woman that had been diseased with an issue of blood for twelve years, came behind him, and touched the fringe of his mantle.

21. For she said within herself: If I may only touch his mantle, I shall be saved.

22. But Jesus turned, and saw her, and said: Daughter, be of good courage; your faith has saved you. And the woman was saved from that hour.

23. And when Jesus came into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making lamentation,

24. he said to them: Depart; for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they derided him.

25. But when the multitude had been sent out, he went in, and took the maiden by the hand, and she arose.

26. And the fame of this went abroad in all that land.  

27. And as Jesus was departing thence, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying: Son of David, have mercy on us.

28. And when he had entered the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them: Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.

29. Then he touched their eyes, and said: According to your faith, be it to you.

30. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly charged them, saying: See that no one know it,

31. But they went out and spread his fame abroad in all that land.  

32. And as they were going out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.

33. And after the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke. And the multitudes were astonished, and said: Never was it seen thus in Israel.

34. But the Pharisees said: He casts out the demons by the prince of the demons.  

35. And Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every infirmity.

36. And when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and scattered as sheep that had no shepherd.

37. Then he said to his disciples: The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.

38. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.   

## Matthew 10

1. And he called to him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they might cast them out, and care every disease and every infirmity.  

2. Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphæus, and Lebbæus, who was surnamed Thaddæus;

4. Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.  

5. These twelve Jesus sent forth after he had charged them, saying: Go not into the road that leads to the Gentiles, and enter not a city of the Samaritans.

6. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And as you go, preach, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

8. Cure the sick, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.

9. Provide for yourselves neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, to put into your purses,

10. nor bag for your journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor staffs: for the laborer is worthy of his support.  

11. Whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there make your home till you go away.

12. When you go into a house, salute it:

13. and if the house be worthy, your peace shall come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you.

14. And whoever will not receive you, nor hear your words, when you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.

15. Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for that city.  

16. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be, therefore, wise as serpents, and guileless as doves.

17. But beware of men: for they will deliver you to the councils, and scourge you in their synagogues;

18. and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

19. But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what you shall speak; for that which you shall speak shall be given you in that hour:

20. for it is not you that speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you.

21. Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father the child; and children will rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.

22. And you will be hated by all men on my account: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.  

23. But when they persecute you in this city, flee into another: for verily I say to you, You will not have made the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of man shall come.

24. The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master.

25. It is enough for the disciple, that he be as his teacher; and for the servant, that he be as his master. If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household?

26. Fear them not, therefore; for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor hidden that shall not be made known.

27. What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light: and what you hear in the ear, preach on the house-tops.  

28. And fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and yet not one of them shall fall upon the ground with out your Father.

30. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Fear not, therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.

32. Whoever, therefore, will confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.

33. But whoever will deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.  

34. Think not that I have come to send peace on the earth. I have not come to send peace, but a sword.

35. For I have come to set a man at variance with his father, and the daughter with her mother, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law:

36. and a man’s enemies shall be those of his own household.

37. He that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loves son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me:

38. and whoever does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.

39. He that finds his life shall lose it; and he that loses his life for my sake, shall find it.

40. He that receives you, receives me: and he that receives me, receives him that sent me.

41. He that receives a prophet because he is a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward: and he that receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s reward.

42. And whoever will give one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink, because he is a disciple, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.   

## Matthew 11

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.  

2. Now when John had heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples,

3. and said to him: Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?

4. And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John what you hear and see.

5. The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them;

6. and blessed is he that shall find in me no cause of offense.  

7. As these were going away, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

8. But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.

9. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

10. For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

11. Verily, I say to you, Among those born of women, there has not risen a greater than John the Immerser. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  

12. From the days of John the Immerser till now, the kingdom of heaven is taken by violence, and men of violence seize upon it eagerly.

13. For all the prophets and the law prophesied till John;

14. and if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah that was to come.

15. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.

16. But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, and calling to their companions,

17. and saying: We have played on the pipe for you, and you have not danced; we have wailed for you, and you have not lamented.

18. For John came, neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He has a demon.

19. The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and they say: Behold, a glutton, and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners. Yet wisdom is vindicated by her children.  

20. Then he began to reprove the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.

21. Alas for thee, Chorazin! alas for thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which have been clone in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, in the day of judgment, than for you.

23. And thou, Capernaum, that hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hades. For if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained till this day.

24. But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for thee.  

25. At that time Jesus answered and said: I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.

26. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.

27. All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son, but the Father; nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

28. Come to me, all you that are weary, and heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.

29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and you shall find rest for your souls.

30. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.   

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Jesus was going, on the Sabbath, through the fields of grain; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pull the ears of grain, and to eat.

2. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him: Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.

3. But he said to them: Have you not read what David did, when he and those who were with him were hungry?

4. how he entered the house of God, and ate the loaves of the presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?

5. Or, have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath-days the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?

6. But I say to you, that something greater than the temple is here.

7. But if you had known what this means―I desire mercy, and not sacrifice―you would not have condemned the blameless.

8. For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.  

9. And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue.

10. And behold, a man was there that had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath-days? that they might accuse him.

11. And he said to them: What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?

12. How much better, then, is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath-days.

13. Then he said to the man: Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored to soundness, like the other.

14. But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him, that they might destroy him.

15. But Jesus perceived it, and withdrew from that place. And many multitudes followed him, and he cured them all.

16. And he charged them not to make him known;

17. that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:

18. Be hold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall declare law to the Gentiles.

19. He shall not contend, nor cry out; nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets.

20. A bruised reed he shall not break, and a smoking wick he shall not extinguish, till he shall send forth his law for conquest.

21. And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.  

22. Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb: and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw.

23. And all the people were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David?

24. But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said: This man does not cast out the demons, unless by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.

25. But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And no city or house divided against itself shall stand.

26. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?

27. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason, they shall be your judges.

28. But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has already come upon you.

29. Or, how can any one enter the house of the strong man and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.

30. He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathers not with me, scatters.  

31. Therefore I say to you, That every sin and impious speech shad be forgiven men: but the impious speech against the Spirit shall not be forgiven men.

32. And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in the present age, or in that which is to come.

33. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree unsound, and its fruit unsound. For by the fruit the tree is known.

34. Generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

35. The good man, out of his good treasury, brings forth good things; and the evil man, out of his evil treasury, brings forth evil things.

36. But I say to you, That for every idle word which men speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.

37. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.  

38. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered and said: Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.

39. But he answered and said to them: A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.

40. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

41. Tho men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it; for they repented in accordance with the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.

42. The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the most distant parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.  

43. When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places seeking rest, and finds none.

44. Then he says: I will return to my house, out of which I came. And he comes and finds it empty, swept, and set in order.

45. Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be with this wicked generation.  

46. While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak to him.

47. And some one said to him: Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak to you.

48. But he answered and said to him that told him: Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?

49. And he stretched out his hand toward his disciples, and said: Behold my mother and my brothers.

50. For whoever will do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.   

## Matthew 13

1. On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea.

2. And many multitudes came together to him, so that he went into a ship and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.  

3. And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: Behold, the sower went out to sow.

4. And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way: and the birds came and ate them up.

5. Others fell on stony places, where they had not much earth; and they immediately sprung up, because they had no depth of earth.

6. But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

7. Others fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them.

8. Others fell upon good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundred, some fifty, some thirty.

9. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.  

10. And the disciples came and said to him: Why dost thou speak to them in parables?

11. He answered, and said to them: Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given.

12. For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him.

13. For this reason I speak to them in parables; because when they see, they see not; and when they hear, they hear not, nor do they understand.

14. And in them is fulfilled the prophesy of Isaiah, which says: You shall surely hear, and you will not understand; and you shall surely see, and you will not perceive.

15. For the heart of this people has become fat; and with their ears they hear heavily; and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn to me, and I should give them health.

16. But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.

17. For verily I say to you, Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.  

18. Hear you, therefore, the parable of the sower.

19. When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that received seed by the wayside.

20. He that received seed on the stony places is he that hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy.

21. Yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while; and when affliction or persecution arises on account of the word, he immediately takes offense.

22. He that received seed among the thorns, is he that hears the word; and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

23. But he that received seed on the good ground, is he that hears the word and understands it; who also produces fruit, and yields, one a hundred; another, sixty; another, thirty.  

24. Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field.

25. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.

26. But when the blade sprung up, and produced fruit, then appeared the tares also.

27. And the servants of the master of the house came, and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Whence, then, has it tares?

28. He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Is it your will, then, that we go and gather them up?

29. But he said, No; lest while you are gathering the tares, you root up the wheat with them.

30. Let both grow together till the harvest, and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares, and bind them into bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my granary.  

31. Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, that a man took and sowed in his field.

32. It is, indeed, the least of all seeds; but when it is grown it is the largest of garden-plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and roost in its branches.  

33. He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.

34. All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them;

35. that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  

36. Then Jesus left the multitudes, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said: Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.

37. He answered and said to them: He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;

38. the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; the tares are the sons of the Wicked One;

39. the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.

40. As, therefore, the tares are collected and burned in fire, so shall it be in the end of this age.

41. The Son of man will send forth his angels, and collect out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who work iniquity,

42. and cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

43. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.  

44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field, which, when a man finds it, he hides; and for the joy it gives, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.  

45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls.

46. When he finds one pearl of great value, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys it.  

47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that is cast into the sea, and that gathers of every kind:

48. when it is full, they draw it to the shore; and sitting down, they collect the good into vessels, but throw the bad away.

49. So shall it be in the end of the age: the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the just,

50. and cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  

51. Jesus said to them: Have you understood all these things? They said to him: Yes, Lord.

52. He said to them: Therefore, every scribe that is trained for the kingdom of heaven, is like the master of a house, who brings out of his treasury things new and old.  

53. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.

54. And he came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said: Whence has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

55. Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?

56. And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence, then, has this man all these things?

57. And they found in him occasion for offense. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, unless it be in his own country and in his own house.

58. And he did not many mighty works there, on account of their unbelief.   

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus;

2. and he said to his servants: This is John The Immerser; he has risen from the dead; and for this reason the powers of the spiritual world are active within him.  

3. For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.

4. For John said to him: It is not lawful for you to have her.

5. And he intended to put him to death, but feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.

6. But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.

7. Wherefore he promised, with an oath, to give her whatever she would ask.

8. And being previously instigated by her mother, she said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Immerser?

9. And the king was grieved: but on account of his oath, and those who reclined at table with him, he commanded it to be given.

10. And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.

11. And his head was brought in a dish, and given to the maiden: and she carried it to her mother.

12. And his disciples came and took away the body, and buried it; and went and told Jesus.  

13. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew from that place, by ship, into a desert place apart: and the multitudes, when they heard of his departure, followed him, on foot, from the cities.  

14. And when Jesus came out, he saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion for them, and cured their sick.  

15. And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, and said: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.

16. But Jesus said to them: They need not go away; do you give them food.

17. They said to him: We have here but five loaves and two fishes.

18. He said: Bring them hither to me.

19. And he commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass: and he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke, and gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the multitudes.

20. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what remained of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.

21. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.  

22. And he immediately constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and go before him to the opposite side, while he sent the multitudes away.

23. And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.

24. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was against them.  

25. And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.

26. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were alarmed, and said: It is a specter! and they cried out for fear.

27. But Jesus immediately spoke to them, and said: Take courage; it is I; be not afraid.

28. And Peter answered him, and said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.

29. And he said: Come. And Peter went down from the ship, and walked upon the water to go to Jesus.

30. But when he saw the wind strong, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.

31. And Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and said to him: O you of little faith, why did you doubt?

32. And when they had entered the ship, the wind ceased.

33. And they that were in the ship came and worshiped him, saying: Truly, thou art the Son of God.  

34. And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.

35. And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all the neighboring country, and brought to him all that were sick;

36. and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his mantle; and as many as touched were perfectly saved.   

## Matthew 15

1. Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees that were of Jerusalem, saying:

2. Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.

3. But he answered and said to them: And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?

4. For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He that curses father or mother shall surely be put to death.

5. But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever of mine might profit you, is a gift, he must in no way honor his father or his mother;

6. and you make the commandment of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.

7. Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,

8. This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

9. But in vain, do they worship me, teaching precepts, the commandments of men.  

10. And he called the multitude to him, and said to them: Hear and understand;

11. That which enters the mouth does not defile the man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.  

12. Then came his disciples and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard that saying, were offended?

13. But he answered and said: Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.

14. Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.

15. But Peter answered and said to him: Explain to us this dark saying.

16. Jesus replied: Are you also yet without understanding?

17. Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth passes into the belly, and is cast out into the sink?

18. But those things which go out from the mouth, come from the heart; and these defile the man.

19. For from the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, lewd actions, thefts, false testimonies, impious words.

20. These are the things that defile the man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.  

21. And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And behold, a woman of Chanaan came out from those borders, and cried to him, saying: Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.

23. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she cries after us.

24. But he answered and said: I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. But she came and did him homage, saying: Lord, help me.

26. He answered and said: It is not good to take the children’s bread, and throw it to the little dogs.

27. She replied: Yes, Lord; and yet thou canst help me; for the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.

28. Then Jesus answered and said to her: O woman, great is your faith; be it to you as you desire. And her daughter was restored to health from that hour.  

29. And Jesus departed thence, and came near the sea of Galilee, and went up into the mountain, and sat there.

30. And many multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the deaf, the maimed, and many others; and laid them at the feet of Jesus, and he cured them;

31. so that the multitudes were astonished, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.  

32. Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said: I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat. And I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint on the road.

33. And his disciples said to him: Whence should we have in the desert as many loaves as would satisfy so great a multitude?

34. And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? They said: Seven, and a few little fishes.

35. And he commanded the multitude to recline on the ground.

36. And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave thorn to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the multitude.

37. And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up what remained of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.

38. And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.

39. And he sent the multitudes away, and entered the ship, and went into the borders of Magdala.   

## Matthew 16

1. And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to tempt him, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.

2. But he answered and said to them: When it is evening, you say, Fair weather; for the sky is red.

3. And in the morning, A storm to-day; for the sky is red and lowering. Hypocrites! you know how to judge of the face of the sky; but you can not judge of the signs of the times.

4. A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign: and no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet. And he left them and departed.  

5. And his disciples came to the other side, and had forgotten to take bread.

6. And Jesus said to them: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

7. And they reasoned among themselves, saying: It is because we took no bread.

8. And Jesus perceiving it, said to them: O you of little faith! why are you reasoning among yourselves because you took no bread?

9. Do you not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?

10. Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?

11. How is it that you do not understand, that I did not speak of bread when I commanded you to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

12. Then they understood that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  

13. When Jesus came into the regions of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying: Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am?

14. They replied: Some say that thou art John the Immerser; others, Elijah; others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. He said to them: But who say you that I am?

16. Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

17. And Jesus answered and said to him: Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah; for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.

18. And I say to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church: and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it.

19. And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

20. Then he charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.  

21. From that time Jesus began to tell his disciples plainly, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be put to death, and be raised again the third day.

22. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying: Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be to thee.

23. But he turned and said to Peter: Get behind me, adversary; you are a snare to me: for you are not thinking of the things of God; but of the things of men.  

24. Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any one determines to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

25. For whoever will save his life, shall lose it. But whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.

26. For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own life? Or, what will a man give as the ransom of his life?

27. For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he will reward every one according to his deeds.

28. Verily I say to you, There are some standing here that shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.   

## Matthew 17

1. And after six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up into a high mountain apart:

2. and he was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his clothing was white as the light.

3. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.

4. And Peter answered and said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

5. While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and lo, a voice from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear him.

6. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were greatly afraid.

7. And Jesus came and touched them, and said: Arise and be not afraid.

8. And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.  

9. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no one, till the Son of man has risen from the dead.

10. And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

11. Jesus answered and said to them: Elijah, indeed, comes first, and he will restore all things.

12. But I say to you, That Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him what they wished; so also shall the Son of man suffer at their hands.

13. Then, the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Immerser.  

14. And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a man who knelt to him,

15. and said: Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is a lunatic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to cure him.

17. Jesus answered and said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.

18. And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out of him: and the child was cured from that hour.  

19. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said: Why were we not able to cast him out?

20. And Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For verily I say to you, If you have faith like a grain of mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, Be removed from this place to that, and it shall be removed: and nothing shall be impossible for you.

21. But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.  

22. And as they were making their journey in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men;

23. and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised again. And they were very sad.  

24. And when they had come into Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma came to Peter, and said: Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?

25. He said: Yes. And when he had come into the house, before he had spoken, Jesus said to him: What think you, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tax or tribute? From their own sons, or from the sons of others?

26. Peter said to him: From the sons of others. Jesus said to him: Then are their own sons free.

27. But that we may give them no offense, go to the sea, and throw in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first; and when you have opened his mouth, you will find a stater; take that, and give to them for me and you.   

## Matthew 18

1. At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, and said: Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

2. And Jesus called a little child to him, and placed him in the midst of them,

3. and said: Verily I say to you, Unless you turn and become as little children, you can not enter the kingdom of heaven.

4. Whoever, therefore, humbles himself as this little child, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

5. And whoever receives one such little child on my account, receives me;

6. but whoever ensnares one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.  

7. Alas for the world because of snares! for it is necessary that snares come: but alas for that man by whom the snare comes!

8. If, then, your hand or your foot ensnares you, cut it off, and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire.

9. And if your eye ensnares you, pull it out, and throw it from you. It is better to enter into life with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell-fire.  

10. Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, That their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.

11. For the Son of man has come to save that which is lost.

12. What think you? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them go astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine, and go into the mountains, and seek for that which has gone astray?

13. And if it so be that he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

14. Even so, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should be lost.  

15. And if your brother sin against you, go and tell him of his fault between you and him alone; if he hear you, you have gained your brother.

16. But if he will not hear you, take with you one or two more, that, by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established.

17. But if he refuse to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he also refuse to hear the church, let him be to you as a heathen man and a publican.  

18. Verily, I say to you, my disciples, Whatever you bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

19. Again, I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about any thing for which they will ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.

20. For where there are two or three that have come together for my sake, there I am in the midst of them.  

21. Then Peter came to him, and said: Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times?

22. Jesus said to him: I say to you, Not till seven times, but till seventy times seven.

23. For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king that wished to settle accounts with his servants.

24. And when he began to make a settlement, there was brought to him one that owed him ten thou sand talents.

25. But as he was not able to pay, his lord commanded him, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, to be sold, and payment to be made.

26. Therefore, the servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, Lord, and I will pay you all.

27. And the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and let him go, and forgave him the debt.  

28. But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hold of him, and took him by the throat, saying: Pay me what you owe.

29. Then his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.

30. And he would not; but went and threw him into prison, till he should pay the debt.

31. When his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sad, and went and made known to their lord all that was done.

32. Then his lord called him and said to him: Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you besought me.

33. Ought you not to have had mercy on your fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on you?

34. And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all that was due him.

35. So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if, from your hearts, you forgive not every one his brother’s offenses.   

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these discourses, that he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.

2. And many multitudes followed him; and he cured them there.  

3. And the Pharisees came to him to tempt him, and said to him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

4. He answered and said to them: Have you not read that the Creator, at the beginning, created them male and female,

5. and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh?

6. So then, they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man put asunder.  

7. They said to him: Why, then, did Moses command us to give a bill of divorce and put her away?

8. He said to them: Moses, on account of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.

9. But I say to you, That whoever puts away his wife, unless for lewdness, and marries another, commits adultery; and he that marries her that is put away, commits adultery.  

10. His disciples said to him: If the relation of man and wife be such, it is not good to marry.

11. But he said to them: All can not accept this saying; only those to whom it is given.

12. For there are eunuchs that were born such from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs that have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs that have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him accept it that is able to accept it.  

13. Then little children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.

14. But Jesus said: Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

15. And he laid his hands on them, and departed from that place.  

16. And behold, one came and said to him: Good teacher, what good thing must I do that I may have eternal life? He said to him:

17. Why do you call me good? There is none good but one, that is God. But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.

18. He said to him: Which? Jesus replied: You shall not kill; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony;

19. Honor your father and your mother; and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

20. The young man said to him: All these have I kept from my youth, what do I lack?

21. Jesus said to him: If you would be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

22. When the young man heard that saying, he went away grieved; for he had great possessions.  

23. Jesus said to his disciples: Verily I say to you, A rich man will with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven.

24. And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

25. When the disciples heard it, they were greatly amazed, and said: Who, then, can be saved?

26. But Jesus looked on them, and said to them: With men, this is impossible; but with God, all things are possible.  

27. Then Peter answered and said to him: Behold, we have left all and followed thee; what, then, shall we have?

28. Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, That, in the restoration, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne, you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And every one that has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundred-fold, and shall inherit eternal life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.   

## Matthew 20

1. For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.

2. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the market, idle;

4. and he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.

5. And they went. Again he went out about the sixth, and about the ninth hour, and did in like manner.

6. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here all the day idle?

7. They said to him: No man has hired us. He said to them: Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right you shall receive.  

8. When the evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward: Call the laborers, and, beginning with the last, pay them their hire even to the first.

9. And when those came who had been hired about the eleventh hour, they received each one a denarius.

10. But when those came who had been hired first, they thought that they would receive more; and they received each one a denarius.

11. And when they received it, they murmured against the master of the house,

12. saying: These last have worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day, and the heat.

13. But he answered and said to one of them: Friend, I do you no injustice; did you not agree with me for a denarius?

14. Take what is yours, and go; I will give to this last even as to you.

15. Is it not allowed me to do what I will with my own? Or, is your eye envious, because I am good?

16. So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.  

17. And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside on his journey, and said to them:

18. Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,

19. and will deliver him to the Gentiles to deride, and to scourge, and to crucify: and on the third day he shall rise again.  

20. Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down, and asking something of him.

21. He said to her: What do you wish? She said to him: Command that these two sons of mine may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.

22. But Jesus answered and said: You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and to be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed? They said to him: We are able.

23. And he said to them: You shall drink my cup, and be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it has been prepared by my Father.  

24. And when the ten heard it, their anger was aroused against the two brothers.

25. But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the rulers of the Gentiles act as lords over them, and their great men have authority over them.

26. It shall not be so among you. But whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.

27. And whoever will be first among you, let him be your servant;

28. even as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  

29. And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.

30. And behold, two blind men, sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying: Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David.

31. And the multitude charged them to be silent. But they cried the more, saying: Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David.

32. And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said: What do you wish me to do for you?

33. They said to him: Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

34. Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes; and their eyes immediately received sight, and they followed him.   

## Matthew 21

1. And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,

2. saying to them: Go into the village opposite to you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.

3. And if any one say any thing to you, you shall reply: The Lord has need of them: and he will immediately send them.

4. All this was done, that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:

5. Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your king comes to you, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.  

6. And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them;

7. and brought the ass and the colt, and put their mantles on them, and caused him to sit upon them.

8. And a very great multitude spread their mantles in the road: and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the road.

9. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed after, cried, saying: Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.  

10. And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was moved, and said: Who is this?

11. And the multitude said: This is Jesus the prophet, that is from Nazareth of Galilee.  

12. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves,

13. and said to them: It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.

14. And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.

15. But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David, their anger was aroused,

16. and they said to him: Do you not hear what these say? And Jesus said to them: Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

17. And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and there spent the night.  

18. Now in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry:

19. and seeing a fig-tree on the road, he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves; and he said to it: Let no fruit grow on you henceforth forever. And the fig-tree immediately withered.

20. And when the disciples saw it, they were astonished, and said: How soon has the fig-tree withered!

21. Jesus answered and said to them: Verily I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall do, not only what is done to the fig-tree, but even if you shall say to this mountain, Be taken up, and be thrown into the sea, it shall be done.

22. And all things that you ask for in prayer, believing, you shall receive.  

23. And after he had come into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said: By what authority do you these things? And who gave you this authority?

24. Jesus answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, which if you will tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.

25. The immersion of John, whence was it? from heaven, or from men? But they reasoned among themselves, and said, If we reply, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?

26. But if we reply, From men, we fear the multitude; for all regard John as a prophet.

27. And they answered and said to Jesus: We know not. And he said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.  

28. But what think you? A man had two sons; and he went to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard.

29. He answered and said, I will not. But he afterward regretted it, and went.

30. And he came to the other, and spoke to him in like manner. And he answered and said, I go, sir; and went not.

31. Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to him, The first. Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

32. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not. But the publicans and the harlots believed him. And you, when you had seen it, afterward felt no regret, that you might believe him.  

33. Hear another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and rigged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went into another country.

34. And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vine-dressers to receive the fruits of it.

35. And the vine-dressers took his servants, and scourged one, and killed another, and stoned another.

36. Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them in like manner.

37. But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.

38. But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and seize upon the inheritance.

39. And they took him, and carried him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

40. Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?  

41. They said to him: He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and let out his vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will give him the fruits in their season.

42. Jesus said to them: Did you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?

43. This was from the Lord, and it is wondrous in our eyes. For this reason, I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation that will bring forth the fruits of it.

44. And he that falls upon this stone shall be dashed to pieces; but him on whom it shall fall, it will make like chaff for the wind.  

45. And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.

46. And when they sought to lay hold of him, they feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.   

## Matthew 22

1. And Jesus answering, spoke to them again in parables, saying:

2. The kingdom of heaven is like a king that made a marriage feast for his son;

3. and sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the marriage feast; and they refused to come.

4. Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.

5. But they were careless, and went away, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.

6. And the rest laid hold of his servants, and abused them, and killed them.  

7. And when that king heard of it, he was angry, and sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.

8. Then he said to his servants: The marriage feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.

9. Go, therefore, to the cross-ways, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.

10. And those servants went out into the roads, and brought together all, as many as they found, both bad and good: and the banquet-room was filled with guests.

11. And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man that had not put on a wedding-robe.

12. And he said to him, Friend, how came you in hither without a wedding-robe? And he was silent.

13. Then the king said to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and throw him into the darkness without: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

14. For many are called, but few chosen.  

15. Then the Pharisees went and held a consultation, that they might entrap him in his words.

16. And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying: Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth, and care not for any one: for you do not look upon the person of men.

17. Tell us, therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?

18. But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said to them: Why do you tempt me, hypocrites?

19. Show me the tribute-money. And they brought him a denarius.

20. And he said to them: Whose image and superscription is this?

21. They said to him: Cæsar’s. Then he said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.

22. And when they heard it, they were astonished, and left him, and went away.  

23. On that day there came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they put a question to him,

24. saying: Teacher, Moses commanded, If any one die without children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up children for his brother.

25. Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died; and, having no child, left his wife to his brother.

26. In like manner also the second, and the third, to the seventh.

27. Last of all, the woman also died.

28. Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be the wife? for they all had her.  

29. Jesus answered and said to them: You err, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.

30. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

31. But, concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying:

32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

33. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.  

34. When the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together.

35. And one of them, who was a lawyer, asked him a question, that he might tempt him, saying:

36. Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?

37. Jesus said to him: You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind.

38. This is the first and great commandment.

39. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

40. On these two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets.  

41. While the Pharisees were together, Jesus asked them a question,

42. saying: What think you of the Christ? whose son is he? They said to him: The son of David.

43. He said to them: How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,

44. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool.

45. If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?

46. And no one was able to answer him a word; nor did any one, from that day, dare to ask him another question.   

## Matthew 23

1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes, and to his disciples,

2. saying: The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat:

3. therefore, all things that they command you to observe, observe and do. But do not according to their works: for they command, and do not.

4. For they bind up burdens that are heavy and hard to be borne, and lay them on the shoulders of men; but they refuse to move them with one of their fingers.

5. And they do all their works for the purpose of being seen by men. They make their amulets broad, and enlarge the fringes of their mantles.

6. They also love the most honorable places at suppers, and the first seats in the synagogues,

7. and salutations in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.  

8. But you must not be called Rabbi; for one is your leader, and all of you are brethren.

9. And call no man on earth your father; for one is your Father, who is in heaven.

10. And be not called leaders; for one is your leader, the Christ.

11. And the greatest among you shall be your minister.

12. Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.  

13. But alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you eat up the houses of widows, and for a pretext make long prayers. For this reason, you shall receive the greater condemnation.

14. Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you close the kingdom of heaven in the face of men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you suffer those who are entering, to go in.

15. Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, you make him twofold more a child of hell than yourselves.  

16. Alas for you, blind guides! who say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, becomes a debtor.

17. Fools and blind! for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?

18. And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gift that is on it, becomes a debtor.

19. Fools and blind! for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?

20. Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all that is on it.

21. And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him that dwells in it.

22. And he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him that sits upon it.  

23. Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, its justice, its mercy, and its faithfulness. These you ought to have done, and those you ought not to have neglected.

24. Blind guides! who strain out a gnat, but swallow a camel.

25. Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you make clean the outside of the cup and the plate; but within they are full of rapine and excess.

26. Blind Pharisee! first make clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside of them also may be clean.  

27. Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitened sepulchers, which without appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.

28. So also you outwardly appear to men to be just, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

29. Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchers of the righteous,

30. and say: If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

31. So then you testify against yourselves, that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.

32. Do you also fill up the measure of your fathers.

33. Serpents, generation of vipers, how can you escape the condemnation of hell?  

34. For this reason, behold, I send you prophets and wise men and scribes; and some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;

35. that upon you may come all the righteous blood which has been shed upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the just to the blood of Zachariah, the son of Barachiah, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.

36. Verily I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation.  

37. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest those who are sent to thee, how often have I desired to gather thy children together, as a bird gathers her young under her wings, and you refused.

38. Behold, your house is left to you deserted.

39. For I say to you, That you shall not see me henceforth, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.   

## Matthew 24

1. And Jesus went out, and was departing from the temple, and his disciples came to him to point out to him the buildings of the temple.

2. But Jesus said to them: Do you not see all these things? Verily I say to you, There shall not be left here a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down,  

3. And as he was sitting upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, and said: Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the age?

4. And Jesus answered and said to them: Take heed that no one deceive you.

5. For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and will deceive many.

6. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled, for all things must be fulfilled; but the end is not yet.

7. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in various places.

8. But all these are the beginning of sorrows.

9. Then they will deliver you up to affliction, and kill you; and you will be hated by all nations on my account.

10. And then will many be ensnared, and they will deliver one another up, and hate one another;

11. and many false prophets will arise, and deceive many;

12. and because iniquity abounds, the love of many will grow cold.

13. But he that endures to the end, shall be saved.

14. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole habitable earth, for a testimony to all nations, and then shall the end come.  

15. When, therefore, you see that detestable thing that makes desolate, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let him that reads understand;)

16. then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;

17. let not him that is on the house-top come down to take his goods out of his house;

18. and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his clothing.

19. But alas for those who are with child, and those who give suck in those days!

20. Pray that your flight may not be in the winter, nor on the Sabbath:

21. for then shall be great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world till now, nor shall ever be.

22. And unless those days should be made few, no flesh could be saved. But on account of the elect those days shall be made few.  

23. Then if any one shall say to you: Lo! here is the Christ, or there; believe it not.

24. For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.

25. Behold, I have told you beforehand.

26. Therefore, if they say to you: Behold, he is in the desert; go not out: Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.

27. For as the lightning comes out from the east, and shines even to the west, so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.

28. For wherever the carcass is, there will the vultures come together.  

29. Immediately after the affliction of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the hosts of the heavens shall be shaken.

30. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the land mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

31. And he will send his angels with a trumpet of great voice, and they shall gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  

32. Learn now a parable from the fig-tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.

33. So also, when you see all these things, know that it is near at the doors.

34. Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away till all these things shall have taken place.

35. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  

36. But of that day and hour no one knows, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

37. But as the days of Noah were, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.

38. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, till the day in which Noah entered the ark,

39. and knew not, till the flood came and took them all away: so shall be the coming of the Son of man.

40. Then two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken, and the other left.

41. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one shall be taken, and the other left.  

42. Watch, therefore, for you know not at what hour your Lord is coming.

43. But know this, That if the master of the house had known at what watch the thief comes, he would have watched, and would not have permitted his house to be broken open.

44. For this reason, be you also ready; for at an hour in which you think not, the Son of man comes.

45. Who then is that faithful and wise servant, whom his master has made ruler over his household servants, to give them their food in due time?

46. Blessed is that servant, whom his master, when he comes, shall find so doing.

47. Verily I say to you, That he will make him ruler over all his goods.  

48. But if that wicked servant shall say in his heart, My master delays his coming;

49. and shall begin to strike his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;

50. the master of that servant will come in a day in which he looks not for him, and at an hour which he knows not,

51. and will cut him in two, and appoint him his part with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.   

## Matthew 25

1. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bride-groom.

2. Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

3. Those who were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

4. but the wise took oil in their vessels, with their lamps.

5. While the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.

6. And at midnight a cry was made: Behold, the bridegroom comes! Go you out to meet him.

7. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

8. And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.

9. But the wise answered, saying: Lest there may not be enough for us and you, go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.

10. While they were going to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage-supper; and the door was closed.

11. Afterward the other virgins also came, and said: Lord! Lord! open for us.

12. But he answered and said: Verily I say to you, I know you not.

13. Watch, therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.  

14. For as a man, on leaving his country, called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods:

15. To one he gave five talents; to another, two; and to another, one; to each one, according to his own ability, and immediately left his country.

16. Then he that had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and made other five talents.

17. In like manner also, he that had received the two, gained other two.

18. But he that had received the one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.  

19. After a long time, the lord of those servants came and settled with them.

20. And he that had received the five talents came and brought other five talents, and said: Lord, you delivered to me five talents: see, I have gained other five talents in addition to them.

21. His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.  

22. And he also that had received the two talents came, and said: Lord, you delivered to me two talents; see, I have gained other two talents in addition to them.

23. His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.  

24. But he that had received the one talent came, and said: Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.

25. And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth; see, you have yours.

26. His lord answered and said to him: Wicked and slothful servant; did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter?

27. Therefore, you ought to have put my money with the bankers; and, when I came, I could have received my own with interest.

28. Therefore, take from him the talent, and give it to him that has the ten talents.

29. For to every one that has, it shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away.

30. And cast the unprofitable servant into the darkness without. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  

31. When the Son of man shall come in his own glory, and all the holy angels with him, then will he sit on the throne of his own glory;

32. and all nations shall be gathered before him; and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats.

33. And he will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.

34. Then the King will say to those on his right hand: Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

35. For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me to your houses;

36. naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.

37. Then will the righteous answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and feed thee? or thirsty, and give thee drink?

38. When did we see thee a stranger, and take thee to our home? or naked, and clothe thee?

39. When did we see thee sick, or in prison, and come to thee?

40. And the King will answer and say to them: Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.  

41. Then will he say to those on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.

42. For I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;

43. I was a stranger, and you took me not to your houses; naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.

44. Then they also will answer, and say: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?

45. Then will he answer them, saying: Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.

46. And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.   

## Matthew 26

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples:

2. You know that after two days the passover is kept, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.  

3. Then the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people met together at the palace of the chief priest, who was called Caiaphas.

4. And they consulted together that they might take Jesus by craft and kill him.

5. But they said: Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult among the people.  

6. When Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. there came to him a woman who had an alabaster box of very costly ointment; and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table.

8. But when his disciples saw it, they were displeased, and said: For what purpose was this waste?

9. For this could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

10. Jesus perceived it, and said to them: Why do you trouble the woman? For she has performed a good work upon me.

11. For you have the poor always with you, but me you have not always.

12. For in pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.

13. Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, this also which she has done shall be told for a memorial of her.  

14. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,

15. and said: What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed to him thirty pieces of silver.

16. And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up.  

17. On the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, and said to him: Where dost thou wish that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?

18. He replied: Go into the city, to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the passover at your house, with my disciples.

19. And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and prepared the passover.  

20. When the evening had come, he reclined at table with the twelve.

21. And as they were eating, he said: Verily I say to you, One of you will deliver me up.

22. And they were very sad, and began each one of them to say to him: Lord, is it I?

23. He answered and said: He that dips his hand with me in the dish, will deliver me up.

24. The Son of man goes, as it is written of him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! It would have been good for that man, if he had not been born.

25. And Judas, who delivered him up, answered and said: Rabbi, is it I? He replied: You have said.  

26. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said: Take, eat; this is my body.

27. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: Do you all drink of it:

28. for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many in order to the remission of sins.

29. But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.  

30. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

31. Then Jesus said to them: All of you will he offended at me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.

32. But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. Peter answered and said to him: Though all shall be offended at thee, yet will I never be offended.

34. Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, This night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.

35. Peter said to him: Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee. In like manner said all the disciples.  

36. Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples: Sit here, till I go and pray yonder.

37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be in deep distress and anguish of soul.

38. Then Jesus said to them: My soul is encompassed with sorrow even to death; remain here, and watch with me.

39. And he went forward a little, and fell on his face in prayer, saying: My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou willest.

40. And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter: Was it so, that you had not strength to watch with me one hour?

41. Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is, willing, but the flesh is weak.  

42. Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed, saying: My Father, if this cup cannot pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.

43. And he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.

44. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.

45. Then he came to his disciples, and said to them: Bleep what time is left, and take your rest; behold, the hour draws near, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners.

46. Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up is at hand.  

47. And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48. He that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying: The one that I shall kiss is he; hold him fast.

49. And immediately he came to Jesus, and said: Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.

50. Jesus said to him: Friend, for what purpose have you come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him fast.  

51. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.

52. Then Jesus said to him: Put back your sword into its place; for all that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.

53. Do you think that I can not now call upon my Father, and he would cause more than twelve legions of angels to stand by me?

54. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  

55. At the same time Jesus said to the multitudes: Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I sat daily with you in the temple and taught, and you did not take me.

56. All this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.  

57. And those who took Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders had come together.

58. But Peter followed him, at a distance, to the palace of the chief priest, and went in and sat with the attendants, to see the end.

59. And the chief priests and the elders, and the whole Sanhedrin, sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death,

60. and found none. Though many false witnesses came, yet they found none. At last two false witnesses came,

61. and said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

62. And the chief priest arose, and said to him: Do you make no answer? What do these testify against you?

63. But Jesus remained silent.   And the chief priest answered and said to him: I adjure you, by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God?

64. Jesus said to him: You have said. Moreover, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.

65. Then the chief priest rent his clothes, and said: He has spoken impiously; what further need have we of witnesses? See now, you have heard his impious words:

66. What think you? They answered and said: He is a subject for death.

67. Then did they spit in his face, and strike him with their fists; some struck him with the open hand,

68. and said: Give a response to us, Christ: Who is he that struck you?  

69. But Peter was sitting without in the court; and a maid-servant came to him, and said: You also were with Jesus of Galilee.

70. But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what you say.

71. And when he went out into the entrance, another maid-servant saw him, and said to those who were there: This man was also with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. And again he denied, with an oath: I know not the man.

73. After a little while, those who stood by came and said to Peter: Of a truth you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.

74. Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.

75. And Peter remembered the word which. Jesus had spoken to him: Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly.   

## Matthew 27

1. When the morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people held a consultation against Jesus, that they might put him to death.

2. And they bound him and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.  

3. Then Judas, who had delivered him up, when he saw that he was condemned, stung by remorse, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

4. saying: I have sinned in having delivered up innocent blood. They replied: What is that to us? You will see to that.

5. And he threw down the money in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.

6. And the chief priests took the money, and said: It is not lawful to put it into the sacred treasury, because it is the price of blood.

7. And they took counsel, and bought with it the potter’s field, as a burial-place for foreigners.

8. For this reason, that field is called the field of blood, to this day.

9. Then the word was fulfilled which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that had a price set upon him, on whom some of the children of Israel did set a price,

10. and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.  

11. And Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus replied to him: You say it.

12. And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.

13. Then Pilate said to him: Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?

14. And he gave him answer to not one word, so that the governor was greatly astonished.  

15. Now at the feast, the governor was in the habit of releasing to the multitude one prisoner, whom they chose.

16. They then had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.

17. Therefore, while they were together, Pilate said to them: Which do you wish me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?

18. For he knew that through envy they had delivered him up.  

19. While he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered much to-day in a dream, because of him.  

20. But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude to ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

21. The governor answered and said to them: Which of the two do you wish me to release to you? They replied: Barabbas.

22. Pilate said to them: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said to him: Let him be crucified.

23. But the governor said: Why, what evil has he done? But they cried vehemently, saying: Let him be crucified.

24. When Pilate saw that he gained nothing, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, and said: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; you will see to it.

25. And all the people answered and said: His blood be upon us and upon our children.

26. Then he released to them Barabbas; but after he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.  

27. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the palace, and brought together to him the whole band.

28. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet cloak;

29. and when they had plaited a crown of thorn branches, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and kneeling before him, they derided him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews!

30. And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head.

31. And when they had derided him, they took off the cloak from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.  

32. And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: this man they compelled to carry his cross.

33. And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, which, when translated, is the place of a skull,

34. they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall; and when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.

35. And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among themselves, by casting the lot.

36. And they sat down and watched him there.

37. And they placed above his head the charge that was made against him, written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. Then were two robbers crucified with him; one on his right hand, and the other on his left.  

39. And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,

40. and saying: You that destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.

41. In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, derided him, and said:

42. He saved others; himself he can not save. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.

43. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he delights in him; for he said: I am the Son of God.

44. The robbers also that were crucified with him, uttered the same reproaches against him.  

45. From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land till the ninth hour.

46. But about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamah sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

47. Some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said: This man calls for Elijah.

48. And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.

49. The rest said: Wait, let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.  

50. And Jesus again cried with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.

51. And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom. And the earth did shake, and the rocks were rent:

52. and the sepulchers were opened, and many bodies of the saints that slept, arose.

53. And they came out of their sepulchers after his resurrection, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.  

54. Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and what was done, were greatly afraid, and said: Of a truth, this was the Son of God.  

55. Many women that had followed Jesus from Galilee, and had ministered to him, were there, looking on from a distance.

56. Among these was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.  

57. When the evening had come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph; and he also was a disciple of Jesus.

58. This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.

59. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen,

60. and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.

61. And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.  

62. On the morrow, which was the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,

63. and said: Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will arise.

64. Therefore, command that the sepulcher be made safe till the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead; and the last error will be worse than the first.

65. Pilate said to them: You have a guard; go, make it as safe as you know how.

66. And they went and made the sepulcher safe, by placing a seal upon the stone, and setting the guard.   

## Matthew 28

1. And after the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulcher.

2. And behold, there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord having descended from heaven, came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

3. His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment was white as snow.

4. From fear of him the keepers did shake and become like dead men.

5. But the angel answered and said to the women: Fear not; for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified.

6. He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

7. And go quickly, and tell his disciples, that he has risen from the dead: and behold, he goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see him. Lo, I have told you.  

8. And they went out quickly from the sepulcher, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

9. And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying: Hail! And they came and laid hold of his feet, and worshiped him.

10. Then Jesus said to them: Fear not; go, tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.  

11. While they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that were done.

12. And when they came together with the elders, they held a consultation, and gave much money to the soldiers,

13. saying: Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep.

14. And if this shall be heard in the presence of the governor, we will persuade him, and make you secure.

15. And they took the money, and did as they were taught. And their report of this matter is everywhere published among the Jews to this day.  

16. And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into the mountain, where Jesus had appointed to meet them.

17. And when they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.

18. And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying: All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me.

19. Go, therefore, make disciples of all nations, immersing them (the disciples) into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;

20. teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and lo; I am with you all the days, even to the end of the age.
