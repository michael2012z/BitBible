# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Since many have attempted to arrange a narrative about the matters which have taken place among us,

2. just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,

3. it seemed good to me also, having followed up accurately all things "from above" Anothen, Gk. Adverb of “place.” Again, from above, from the beginning, for a long time, etc.from above, to write to you in orderly fashion, most distinguished Theophilus,

4. so that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold

5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

7. But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.

8. So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,

9. according to the custom of the priesthood, he was selected to burn incense when he entered into the temple of the Lord.

10. And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.

11. Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

12. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.

13. But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John.

14. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.

15. For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor "strong drink" Sikera, Gk. Transliteration from the Aramaic. Probably meaning any alcoholic beverage, including wine. However, sikera is usually distinguished from oinos, wine. Here in Luke, this is believed to be “barley beer.” (BDAG Lexicon, pg. 923)strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, while still in his mother's womb.

16. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.

17. And he himself will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, Mal 4:6'TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

18. And Zacharias said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."

19. And the angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to proclaim the good news to you of these things.

20. But behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their season."

21. And the people waited for Zacharias, and they marveled at his delaying in the temple.

22. But having come out, he was unable to speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he was making signs to them and remained speechless.

23. And it happened, as soon as the days of his service were fulfilled, that he went away to his house.

24. Now after those days Elizabeth his wife conceived; and stayed in seclusion five months, saying,

25. "Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among men."The Birth of Jesus Foretold

26. Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,

27. to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.

28. And the angel came to her and said, "Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!"

29. But when she saw him, she was greatly perplexed by his saying, and she wondered what sort of greeting this was.

30. Then the angel said to her, "Do not fear, Mary, for you have found grace with God.

31. And behold, you shall conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS.

32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give Him the throne of His father David.

33. And He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end."

34. Then Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I do not know a man?"

35. And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you; therefore, also, that holy child which is to be born shall be called the Son of God.

36. And behold, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for she who was called barren.

37. For with God nothing shall be impossible."

38. Then Mary said, "Behold the maidservant of the Lord! May it be to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.Mary Visits Elizabeth

39. Now Mary rose up in those days and traveled into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,

40. and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.

41. And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

42. Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!

43. And why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the baby leaped for joy in my womb.

45. And blessed is she who has believed, because there shall be a fulfillment to the things having been spoken to her from the Lord."

46. And Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord,

47. and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.

48. Because He looked upon the lowly state of His maidservant; for behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.

49. For He that is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.

50. And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.

51. He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

52. He has overthrown the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly.

53. He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.

54. He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,

55. As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever."

56. And Mary remained with her about three months, and she returned to her house.

57. Now Elizabeth's full time came for her to be delivered, and she bore a son.

58. And when her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her, they rejoiced with her.

59. Now it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they started to call him by the name of his father, Zacharias.

60. His mother answered and said, "No; he shall be called John."

61. But they said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."

62. So they made signs to his father about what he wished him to be called.

63. And asking for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, "His name is John." And they all marveled.

64. Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he started to speak, praising God.

65. Then fear came on all who lived around them; and all these things were being talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.

66. And all those who heard them kept them in their hearts, saying, "What kind of child will this be?" And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. Now his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he prophesied, saying,

68. "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people,

69. and has raised up a horn of "salvation" Soteria, Gk. Noun used frequently in the NT, almost always referring to salvation, in the sense of deliverance from sin and its damning effects through the redemptive work of Christ.salvation for us in the house of His servant David,

70. as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began,

71. that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,

72. to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,

73. the oath which He swore to our father Abraham:

74. to grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,

75. in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.

76. And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,

77. to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,

78. through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;

79. to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."

80. So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel. 

## Luke 2

1. And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of all the empire.

2. This census was the first one while Quirinius was governing Syria.

3. And all were traveling to be registered, each to his own city.

4. Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,

5. to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was pregnant.

6. So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to bear.

7. And she bore her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

8. And shepherds were in the same country, living in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.

9. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.

10. Then the angel said to them, "Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people.

11. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

12. And this will be the sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger."

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:

14. "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth "peace" Eirene, Gk. The Greek word of the Hebrew equivalent, Shalom, which was a standard greeting among Jews.peace, goodwill toward men!"

15. So it was, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go then to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."

16. And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.

17. And when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.

18. And all those who heard it marveled about the things spoken by the shepherds to them.

19. But Mary treasured all these things and pondered them in her heart.

20. Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was spoken to them.The Circumcision of Jesus

21. And when eight days were completed, so they could circumcise Him, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.Jesus Presented in the Temple

22. Now when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord

23. (just as it is written in the law of the Lord, Ex 13:2,12,15"EVERY MALE WHO OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD"),

24. and to offer a sacrifice according to what had been said in the law of the Lord, Lev 12:2,8"A PAIR OF DOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS."The Song and Prophecy of Simeon

25. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

26. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ.

27. So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, that they might do for Him according to the custom of the law,

28. he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:

29. "Lord, now You are releasing Your servant in peace, according to Your word;

30. for my eyes have seen Your salvation

31. which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,

32. a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory to Your people Israel."

33. And Joseph and His mother were marveling at the things being spoken about Him.

34. Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against

35. (yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."The Testimony of Hannah

36. Now there was one, Hannah, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;

37. and she was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.

38. And coming in that instant she was giving thanks to the Lord, and was speaking about Him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem.

39. So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.

40. And the Child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.The Young Jesus in the Temple

41. And His parents traveled to Jerusalem every year to the Feast of the Passover.

42. And when He was twelve years old, when they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,

43. and when they completed the days, while they were returning, the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and Joseph and His mother did not know it.

44. But supposing Him to be in the caravan, they went a day's journey, and sought Him among their relatives and among their acquaintances.

45. And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.

46. Now it came to pass that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.

47. And those who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and His answers.

48. And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, "Child, why have You treated us this way? Look, Your father and I were seeking You anxiously."

49. And He said to them, "Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I "must" Dei, Gk. As expressing the will of God or law; something binding. One of Jesus’ “must” statements; absolute, binding guarantees that will see their definite fulfillment, if they haven’t already.must be about My Father's business?"

50. But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.

51. Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And His mother kept all these things in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. 

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governing Judea, and while Herod governed as tetrarch of Galilee, and while Philip his brother governed as tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and while Lysanias governed as tetrarch of Abilene,

2. in the time of the high priest Annas and the high priest Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3. And he went into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,

4. as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: Isa 40:3-5"A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS: 'PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.

5. EVERY VALLEY SHALL BE FILLED AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL SHALL BE HUMBLED; THE CROOKED ROADS SHALL BECOME STRAIGHT, AND THE ROUGH ROADS SHALL BECOME SMOOTH;

6. AND ALL FLESH SHALL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD.' "John Preaches to the People

7. Then he said to the crowds which came out to be baptized by him, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones!

9. And even now the ax is being laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and is thrown into the fire."

10. So the people were asking him, saying, "What shall we do then?"

11. He answered and said to them, "He who has two shirts, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise."

12. Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"

13. And he said to them, "Collect nothing more than the amount which has been commanded to you."

14. Likewise the soldiers also were asking him, saying, "And what shall we do?" So he said to them, "Do not intimidate anyone or accuse anyone falsely, and be content with your wages."

15. Now while the people waited, and all considered in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Christ,

16. John answered, saying to all, "I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire;

17. whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."

18. And with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people.

19. But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,

20. he also added this to all his other sins, and locked up John in the prison.The Baptism of Jesus

21. Now it came to pass that when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also was baptized. And while He was praying, heaven was opened;

22. and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying, "You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased."The Genealogy of Jesus

23. Now Jesus Himself began His ministry at about thirty years of age, being (as it was supposed) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,

## Luke 4

1. Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

2. being tempted for forty days by the devil. And in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they were completed, He was hungry.

3. And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread."

4. But Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, Deut 8:3'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE, BUT BY EVERY WORD OF GOD.' "

5. Then the devil, leading Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And the devil said to Him, "All this authority I will give You, and their glory; because it has been given to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.

7. Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours."

8. And Jesus answered and said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! It is written, Deut 6:13, 10:20'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND HIM ONLY YOU SHALL SERVE.' "

9. Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.

10. For it is written: Psa 91:11-12'HE SHALL GIVE HIS ANGELS CHARGE OVER YOU, TO GUARD YOU,'

11. "and, 'IN THEIR HANDS THEY SHALL BEAR YOU UP, LEST YOU DASH YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.' "

12. And Jesus answered and said to him, "It has been said, Deut 6:16'YOU SHALL NOT TEMPT THE LORD YOUR GOD.' "

13. Now when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from Him for a season.The Beginning of Jesus’ Ministry in Galilee

14. Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about Him spread thoughout all the surrounding region.

15. And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.Jesus Rejected at Nazareth

16. And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and He stood up to read.

17. And the book of Isaiah the prophet was given to Him. And having unrolled the scroll, He found the place where it was written:

18. Isa 49:8-9, 61:1-2"THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE HAS ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR; HE HAS SENT ME TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, TO PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET AT LIBERTY THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED;

19. TO PREACH THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD."

20. And having rolled up the scroll, when He had given it to the attendant, He sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were looking intently at Him.

21. And He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture is "fulfilled" Here’s the word pleroma again (fullness), this time as a verb, in the perfect passive indicative, to become filled, to be filled with.fulfilled in your hearing."

22. And all were bearing witness to Him, and were marveling at the gracious words which came out of His mouth. And they said, "Is this not Joseph's son?"

23. He said to them, "You will surely say this proverb to Me, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your hometown.' "

24. Then He said, "Assuredly I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his hometown.

25. But I tell you truly, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine all over the land;

26. but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a widow woman.

27. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."

28. So all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,

29. and rising up they threw Him out of the city; and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.

30. But having passed through the midst of them, He went on.Ministry in Capernaum

31. Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath.

32. And they were astonished at His teaching, because His word was with authority.

33. Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,

34. saying, “Ah! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!"

35. But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silenced, and come out from him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, it came out from him, and did not hurt him.

36. And amazement came upon all, and they spoke among themselves, saying, "What is this word! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."

37. And the report about Him was spreading into every place of the surrounding region.Peter’s Mother-in-Law Healed

38. And when He arose from the synagogue, He entered into the house of Simon. But Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they made request of Him about her.

39. And when He stood over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately rising up, she began to serve them.

40. Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them.

41. And also demons were coming out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" And rebuking them, He did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Messiah.

42. Now when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowds were searching for Him, and they came to Him, and tried to restrain Him from leaving them;

43. but He said to them, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this purpose I have been sent."

44. And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. 

## Luke 5

1. Now it came to pass, while the crowd pressed upon Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,

2. and He saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen, after getting out of them, were washing their nets.

3. Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and He asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, He began to teach the crowds from the boat. 

4. Now when He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep and lower your nets for a catch."

5. But Simon answered and said to Him, "Master, we have labored all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will lower the net."

6. And when they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was tearing.

7. So they beckoned to their partners who were in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking. 

8. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"

9. For astonishment gripped him and all who were with him at the haul of fish which they had taken.

10. And likewise also it gripped James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear; from now on you shall be catching men."

11. And having brought the boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.Jesus Cleanses a Leper

12. And it came to pass while He was in a certain city, that behold, there was a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, falling on his face he begged Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."

13. And reaching out His hand, He touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And He ordered him to tell no one, "But go and show yourself to the priest, and bring an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them, just as Moses prescribed."

15. But the report about Him spread all the more; and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed by Him from their sicknesses.

16. But He Himself would withdraw into the wilderness and would pray.Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralytic

17. Now it happened on a certain day that He was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

18. And behold, men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and to lay him before Him.

19. And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, going up on the roof, they lowered him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst in front of Jesus.

20. And seeing their faith, He said to him, "Man, your sins have been forgiven you."

21. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this Man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?"

22. But when Jesus perceived their reasonings, He answered and said to them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?

24. But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—He said to the man who was paralyzed, "I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."

25. Immediately he rose up before them, taking up the bed which he had been lying on, he went off to his own house, glorifying God.

26. And amazement gripped them all, and they were glorifying God, and they were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen "extraordinary" Paradoxos, Gk. Adjective occurring only here in NT. Para=contrary to, doxa=opinion, and thus refers to things that are strange, unexpected, or remarkable.extraordinary things today!"The Calling of Levi (Matthew)

27. After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me."

28. And leaving everything, he arose and followed Him.

29. Then Levi made a great banquet for Him in his own house. And there was a great number of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them to eat.

30. And their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, saying, "Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"

31. Jesus answered and said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.

32. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."The Superiority of the New

33. Then they said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?"

34. And He said to them, "Can you make the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days."

36. Then He spoke a parable to them: "No one puts a patch of a new garment on an old one; otherwise both the new garment tears, and also the patch that was taken out of the new garment does not match with the old garment.

37. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.

38. But one must put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.

39. And no one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new; for he says, 'The old is better.' " 

## Luke 6

1. Now it came to pass on the ∆ευτεροπρωτω, Gk (Deuteroproto). Difficult word to translate. Literally, “second first.” Thanks to Dr. Maurice Robinson for help with this difficult translation.second chief Sabbath, that He was going through the grain fields. And His disciples were picking the heads of grain and were eating them, rubbing them in their hands.

2. But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"

3. But Jesus answering them said, "Have you not even read this, what David did when he became hungry, he and those who were with him:

4. how he entered into the house of God, took and ate the showbread, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?"

5. And He said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

6. Now it happened that on another Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and was teaching. And there was a man there whose right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and Pharisees were observing if whether He would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against Him.

8. But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, "Arise and stand in the midst." And he arose and stood.

9. Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"

10. And when He had looked around at them all, He said to him, "Stretch out your hand." And he did so, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.

11. But they were filled with fury, and they were discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus.The Twelve Apostles

12. Now it came to pass in those days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and He was spending the night in prayer to God.

13. And when it became day, He summoned His disciples, and having chosen twelve from them, whom He also named apostles:

14. He chose Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;

15. Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;

16. Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.

17. And having come down with them, He stood on a level place, with a crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and be healed of their diseases,

18. as well as those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.

19. And all the crowd was trying to touch Him, because power was going out from Him, and was healing them all.The Beatitudes

20. Then He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.

21. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.

22. Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude you, and shall revile you, and cast out your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.

23. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy! For behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in like manner their fathers did to the prophets.Jesus Pronounces Woes

24. "But woe to you who are rich, because you have received your consolation.

25. Woe to you who have been filled, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.

26. Woe to you when men speak well of you, for in like manner their fathers would do to the false prophets.Love Your Enemies

27. "But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,

28. bless those who curse you; pray for those who mistreat you.

29. To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes your outer garment, do not forbid the tunic either.

30. Give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away your belongings, do not ask for them back.

31. And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise.

32. But if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.

33. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.

34. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive it back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may receive the same amount back.

35. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping to receive nothing back; and your reward shall be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil.

36. Therefore be compassionate, just as your Father also is compassionate.Do Not Judge

37. "And do not judge, and you shall not be judged. Do not condemn, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.

38. Give, and it shall be given to you: good measure, pressed down and shaken and running over they shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it shall be measured back to you."

39. And He spoke a parable to them: "Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?

40. A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone having been fully trained will be like his teacher.

41. And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?

42. Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, permit me to remove the speck which is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck which is in your brother's eye.

43. "For a good tree does not produce corrupt fruit, nor does a corrupt tree produce good fruit.

44. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a thorn bush.

Used here figuratively, of the heart, as a storage place for spiritual possessions.treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.Build on the Rock

46. "But why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do the things which I say?

47. Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:

48. He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the stream burst upon that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock.

49. But he who hears and does not do is like a man building a house on the ground without a foundation, against which the stream burst upon; and immediately it fell. And the destruction of that house was great." 

## Luke 7

1. Now when He finished all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum.

2. And a certain centurion's servant, who was highly valued by him, was sick and about to die.

3. And when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, asking Him that He might come and heal his servant.

4. And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying he was worthy for whom He should grant this,

5. for he loves our nation, and he himself has built us a synagogue."

6. Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far away from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.

7. Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You. But just say the word, and my servant shall be healed.

8. For I also am a man appointed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

9. When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, "I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"

10. And when those who were sent returned to the house, they found the servant well who had been sick.Jesus Raises a Dead Man in Nain

11. Now it happened on the next day, that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a great crowd.

12. And when He came near the gate of the city, that behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And many people from the city was with her.

13. When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."

14. Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."

15. So he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.

16. Then fear took hold of all, and they were glorifying God, saying, "A great prophet has risen up among us"; and, "God has visited His people."

17. And this report about Him went out in all Judea, and all the surrounding region.Jesus and John the Baptist

18. Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.

19. And summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?"

20. And when they came to Him, the men said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, 'Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?' "

21. And in that very hour He healed many from diseases, and torments, and evil spirits; and to many blind people He granted sight.

22. Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: that the blind regain sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them.

23. And blessed is he who is not "offended" Here we have the word skandalon once again; of Christ as that stone of stumbling (Rom 9:32-Rom 9:33); to fall away, or to give up believing.offended because of Me."

24. Now when John’s messengers had departed, He began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What have you gone out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

25. But what have you gone out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in royal palaces.

26. But what have you gone out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he about whom it is written: Isa 40:3; Mal 3:1'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.'

28. "For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."

29. And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John.

30. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.

31. "Therefore to what shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned for you, and you did not weep.'

33. "For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'

34. The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'

35. And so wisdom is justified by all her children."A Sinful Woman Forgiven

36. Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And entering into the Pharisee's house, He reclined to eat.

37. And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she found out that He was reclining in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume,

38. and standing by His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and was wiping them with the hair of her head; and she was kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume.

39. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke within himself, saying, "This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is who touches Him, for she is a sinner."

40. And Jesus answered and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he said, "Teacher, say it."

41. There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other owed fifty.

42. And when they had nothing with which to pay back, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?"

43. Simon answered and said, "I suppose it is the one to whom he forgave more." And He said to him, "You have judged correctly."

44. And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but this woman has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.

45. You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not stopped kissing My feet since the time I came in.

46. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with perfume.

47. For which reason I say to you, her many sins have been forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."

48. Then He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."

49. And those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say within themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"

50. Then He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace." 

## Luke 8

1. Now it came to pass afterward, that He was traveling through every city and village, preaching and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God, and the twelve were with Him,

2. and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,

3. and Joanna the wife of Chuza, a supervisor of Herod, and Susanna, and many others who were ministering to them from their belongings.The Parable of the Sower

4. And when a large crowd had gathered, and the people came to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable:

5. A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell alongside the road; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.

6. And other seed fell on rock; and when it grew up, it withered away because it had no moisture.

7. And other seed fell among thorns, and when the thorns grew up with it, they choked it.

8. But other seed fell into good ground, and when it grew up, it produced fruit a hundredfold." Saying these things He was calling out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"

9. Then His disciples asked Him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"

10. And He said, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, that Isa 6:9'SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE, AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND.'The Parable of the Sower Explained

11. "Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.

12. And those beside the road are they that hear; then the "devil" Diabolou, Gk. Interestingly, this word is an adjective, “slanderous”. Used with the definite article, we have “the slanderer.” Those who slander others take on the attributes of the original “slanderer,” Satan himself.devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, lest they believe and be saved.

13. But those on the rock are they that, whenever they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of testing "fall away" Aphestemi, Gk. This is the verb form of which apostasia is derived. The act of falling away, to become apostate. In 2 Thess chapter 2, Paul talks about the falling away, he (definite article) apostasia, as an “infamous” event in time, and uses this word as a noun. To see the verb usage, see 1 Tim 4:1.fall away.

14. And that which fell among thorns, these are those, who when they have heard, go out and are choked with anxieties, riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.

15. But that which fell on the good ground, these are such who when they heard the word, with a noble and good heart, hold on to it and bear fruit with endurance.

16. "No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but sets it on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.

17. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest, nor anything concealed which will not be known and come to light.

18. Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, more shall be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."Jesus and His Family

19. Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd.

20. And it was told Him by some, who said, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You."

21. But He answered and said to them, "My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it."Jesus Calms the Storm

22. Now it came to pass on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake." And they put out to sea.

23. But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down onto the lake, and they were being filled with water, and were in danger.

24. And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master" Epistata, Gk. Here we have another Greek word for the name of Christ, epistata, which means Lord, master, or one of high status. (See Luke 5:5)"Master, Master, we are perishing!" Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. But He said to them, "Where is your faith?" But becoming afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, "Who then is this? For He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!"Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Man

26. Then they sailed to the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.

27. And when He got out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house, but among the tombs.

28. And seeing Jesus and crying out, he fell down before Him, and with a loud voice he said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!"

29. For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For it had seized him at times, and he was bound, kept under guard, with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.

30. Jesus asked him, saying, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion," because many demons had entered into him.

31. And he kept imploring Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.

32. Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain. And they kept imploring Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.

33. Then when the demons came out from the man, they entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.

34. And when those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the country.

35. Then they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had come out of, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and being of sound mind. And they were afraid.

36. And those also who saw reported to them how the demon-possessed man was healed.

37. Then the whole multitude from the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to go away from them, because they were gripped with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned.

38. Now the man from whom the demons had come out was begging Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,

39. "Return to your house, and tell what great things God has done for you." And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city all the things that Jesus did for him.Restoration and Healing

40. So it was, when Jesus returned, that the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.

41. And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a leader of the synagogue. And falling at the feet of Jesus, he was imploring Him to enter into his house,

42. for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He was going, the crowds were pressing against Him.

43. Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who though she had spent her whole livelihood on physicians, was not able to be healed by anyone,

44. approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.

45. And Jesus said, "Who touched Me?" When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the crowds are pressing You hard and crowding You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'

46. But Jesus said, "Someone touched Me, for I perceived that power has gone out from Me."

47. Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she recounted to Him before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.

48. And He said to her, "Take courage, daughter, your faith has "healed" Sozo, Gk. This is the same word used for “save.” Sozo means to save, to preserve from harm, and in relation to sickness, to heal, to cure, or to restore to health.healed you. Go in peace."

49. While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, "Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher."

50. But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, "Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be healed."

51. When He came into the house, He permitted no one to enter except Peter, John, and James, and the father and mother of the child.

52. Now all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, "Do not weep; she is not dead, but asleep."

53. And they were ridiculing Him, knowing that she had died.

54. But He sent them all outside, and having grasped her hand, He called, saying, "Child, arise."

55. Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded something to be given to her to eat.

56. And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened. 

## Luke 9

1. And having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.

2. And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

3. And He said to them, "Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor knapsack nor bread nor silver; and do not have two tunics apiece.

4. Whatever house you may enter, stay there, and from there go out.

5. And as many as will not receive you, when you go out from that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them."

6. As they went out, they were going about village by village, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.Herod Seeks to See Jesus

7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things being done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,

8. and by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen.

9. And Herod said, "John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he was seeking to see Him.The Feeding of the Five Thousand

10. And the apostles, when they had returned, recounted to Him all that they had done. And taking them along, He withdrew privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

11. But when the crowds found out, they followed Him; and He welcomed them, and was speaking to them about the kingdom of God, and He cured those who needed healing.

12. Now when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to Him, "Dismiss the crowd, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and they may find lodging and find provisions; for we are in a deserted place here."

13. But He said to them, "You give them something to eat." And they said, "We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people."

14. For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, "Make them recline in groups of fifty."

15. And they did so, and made them all recline.

16. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.

17. So they all ate and were satisfied, and twelve baskets of the remaining fragments were taken up by them.The Confession of Peter

18. And it came to pass, while He was alone praying, that His disciples joined Him, and He questioned them, saying, "Who do the crowds pronounce Me to be?"

19. So they answered and said, "John the Baptist, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the ancient prophets has arisen."

20. He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?" Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God."Jesus Foretells of His Death and Resurrection

21. And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,

22. saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day."A Call to Discipleship

23. Then He said to them all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.

24. For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake shall save it.

25. For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost?

26. For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.

27. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God."Jesus Transfigured on the Mount

28. Now it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray.

29. And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and glistening.

30. And behold, two men were talking with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,

31. who appearing in glory were talking about His "decease" Exodos, Gk. Noun meaning “going out.” The word is used of the exodus from Egypt (Heb 11:22), and as a euphemism for death as a departure from this life (see 2 Pet 1:15).decease which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.

32. But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; but becoming fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.

33. And it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he was saying.

34. Now as he said these things, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.

35. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son. Listen to Him!"

36. When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. But they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things they had seen.A Boy is Healed

37. Now it happened on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that a great crowd met Him.

38. And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, "Teacher, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child.

39. And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and it departs from him with great difficulty, bruising him.

40. So I begged Your disciples that they might cast it out, but they could not."

41. Then Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."

42. And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.Jesus Again Foretells of His Death

43. And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,

44. "Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."

45. But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.Who is the Greatest?

46. Then a dispute came up among them as to which of them might be the greatest.

47. But Jesus, having seen the thought of their heart, taking a little child, He stood him beside Himself,

48. and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all shall be great."

49. Now John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us."

50. But Jesus said to him, "Do not forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us."A Samaritan Village Rejects the Savior

51. Now it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be received up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,

52. and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, so they might prepare for Him.

53. But they did not receive Him, because He was determined to go to Jerusalem.

54. And when they saw this, James and John His disciples said, "Lord, do You wish that we should call down fire from heaven and consume them, as Elijah did?"

55. But turning, He rebuked them, and said, "You do not know of what sort of spirit you are.

56. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them." And they went to another village.The Cost of Discipleship

57. Now it happened as they journeyed on the road, that someone said to Him, "Lord, I will follow You wherever You go."

58. And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."

59. Then He said to another, "Follow Me." But he said, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."

60. Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."

61. And another also said, "Lord, I will follow You, but first permit me to say farewell to those who are at my house."

62. But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." 

## Luke 10

1. Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and He sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.

2. Then He said to them, "The harvest indeed is great, but the workers are few; therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He may send forth workers into His harvest.

3. Go; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Do not carry a money bag, nor a knapsack, nor sandals; and greet no one along the road.

5. But whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace to this house.'

6. And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon it; if not, it will return to you.

7. And remain in that very house, eating and drinking what they have, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.

8. And into which ever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you.

9. And heal the sick there, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'

10. But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,

11. ‘The very dust from your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'

12. I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.Jesus Pronounces Woes to Impenitent Cities

13. "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. Nevertheless it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.

15. And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.

16. He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me."The Return of the Seventy

17. Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."

18. And He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning out of heaven.

19. Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

20. Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in heaven."Jesus Rejoices in the Spirit

21. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.”

22. And turning to His disciples He said, “All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."

23. And turning to His disciples He said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see;

24. for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and they did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and they did not hear it."The Parable of the Good Samaritan

25. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

26. He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"

27. So he answered and said, Duet 6:5" 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND,' and Lev 19:18'YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.' "

28. And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you shall live."

29. But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

30. Then Jesus answered and said: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and encountered bandits, who after having stripped him of his clothing and having wounded him, departed, leaving him half dead.

31. Now by coincidence a certain priest was coming down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.

32. Likewise a Levite, arriving at the place, came and saw, and passed by on the opposite side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came by him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion.

34. And coming to him, he bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and putting him on his own animal, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, 'Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition, when I come back, I will repay you.'

36. So which of these three does it seem to you proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the bandits?"

37. And he said, "the one who showed mercy to him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."Mary and Martha

38. Now it came to pass as they traveled, that He entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house.

39. And the woman had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and was listening to His word.

40. But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, "Lord, don’t You care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me."

41. And Jesus answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.

42. But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her." 

## Luke 11

1. Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."

2. So He said to them, "Whenever you pray, say: Our Father in the heavens, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

3. Give us day by day our daily bread.

4. And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."

5. And He said to them, "Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves;

6. for a friend has come to me on his journey, and I have nothing to set before him';

7. and he will answer from within and say, 'Do not trouble me; the door has already been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give to you'?

8. I say to you, even if he will not get up and give to him, because he is his friend, yet on account of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.Keep Asking, Seeking, Knocking

9. "So I say to you, ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

10. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.

11. And which father among you, if his son asks for bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish?

12. Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

13. If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, by how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"Jesus and Beelzebub

14. And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon came out, that the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled.

15. But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons."

16. But others, testing Him, were seeking from Him a sign from heaven.

17. But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house divided against a house falls.

18. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.

19. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.

20. But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

21. When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are in peace.

22. But when someone stronger than he comes upon him, he overcomes him, and he takes away his full armor in which he had trusted, and distributes his spoils.

23. He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.An Unclean Spirit Returns

24. "When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and not finding any, he says, 'I will return to my house from where I came out.'

25. And coming, he finds it swept and adorned.

26. Then he goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they come and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first."Keeping the Word

27. And it happened, while He spoke these things, that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb which bore You, and the breasts which nursed You!"

28. But He said, "More than that, blessed are those who hear the word of God and "keep" Phulasso, Gk. “To guard” would be a good translation. The activity of a watchman is the essence here. To be on your guard against. This is a Greek military term.keep it!"Seeking a Sign

29. Now as the crowds gathered even more, He began to say, "This generation is evil. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

30. For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.

31. The queen of the South shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed one greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed one greater than Jonah is here.The Lamp of the Body

33. "No one, having lit a lamp, puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.

34. The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body also is dark.

35. Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.

36. Therefore if your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, the whole body will be full of light, as when the bright shining of a lamp gives light to you."Jesus Pronounces More Woes

37. And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee asked that He would eat with him. And having entered, He reclined to eat.

38. And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first washed before the meal.

39. But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but the inside of you is full of greed and evil.

40. Fools! Did not He who made the outside also make the inside?

41. Nevertheless give what is inside as alms; and see, all things are clean to you.

42. But woe to you Pharisees! Because you pay a tithe of mint and rue and every vegetable, and you pass over justice and the love of God. These things you ought to have done, and not have neglected the others.

43. Woe to you Pharisees! Because you love the first seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.

44. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you are like unmarked graves, and the men walking over them do not know it."

45. Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, "Teacher, by saying these things You insult us also."

46. And He said, "Woe to you lawyers as well! Because you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. Woe to you! Because you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. Consequently, you bear witness to and approve of the deeds of your fathers; because they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs.

49. For this reason also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,'

50. so that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,

51. from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the temple. Yes, I say to you, it shall be required of this generation.

52. Woe to you lawyers! Because you have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter in, and those who were entering in you hindered."

53. And as He said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be dreadfully hostile, and to cross-examine Him about many things,

54. lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch Him in something He might say, so that they might accuse Him. 

## Luke 12

1. Now in the meantime, as an innumerable crowd had gathered together so that they were stepping on one another, He began to say to His disciples first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For there is nothing covered that shall not be unveiled, and nothing secret that shall not be made known.

3. Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear behind closed doors shall be proclaimed on the housetops.Jesus Teaches the Fear of God

4. "And I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have nothing further they can do.

5. But I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who after He kills, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, fear Him!

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God.

7. But the very hairs of your head have all been numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.Whoever Confesses Christ

8. "Also I say to you, whoever confesses Me before men, him the Son of Man also will confess before the angels of God.

9. But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.

10. And anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to him who "blasphemes" Blasphemeo, Gk. To speak injuriously: Towards men—to slander, or defame one’s reputation. Towards God—to insult (Matt 26:65). Also, towards the things of God, such as the gospel message. (Tit 2:5), and towards supernatural beings, such as angels (Jude 8).blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.

11. Now whenever they bring you to the synagogues and rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you should say.

12. For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you must say."The Parable of the Rich Fool

13. Then someone from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."

14. But He said to him, "Man, who appointed Me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"

15. And He said to them, "Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."

16. Then He told a parable to them, saying: "The field of a certain rich man produced well.

17. And he reasoned within himself, saying, 'What shall I do, because I have nowhere to gather my crops?'

18. So he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and I will build bigger ones, and there I will gather all my crops and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid away for many years; relax; eat, drink, and be merry." '

20. But God said to him, 'You fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have prepared?'

21. So is he who accumulates treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."Do Not Worry

22. Then He said to His disciples, "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about the body, what you will wear.

23. Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.

24. Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which have neither storeroom nor barn; and yet God feeds them. How much more are you worth than birds?

25. And which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?

26. Therefore if you cannot do a very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.

28. But if God so clothes the grass, although it is in the field today, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, by how much rather will He clothe you, O you of little faith?

29. And do not seek what you may eat or what you may drink, and do not be anxious.

30. For all these things the nations of the world seek after, but your Father knows that you need these things.

31. But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.

32. Do not fear, little flock, because your Father is well pleased to give to you the kingdom.

33. Sell your possessions and give alms; make for yourselves money bags which do not grow old, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where a thief does not come near, nor does a moth destroy.

34. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.The Faithful Servant and the Evil Servant

35. "Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning;

36. and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master, when he will return from the wedding celebration, so that when he comes and knocks, immediately they may open to him.

37. Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Assuredly I say to you, that he will gird himself and have them recline to eat, and he will come and serve them.

38. And if he comes in the second watch, or comes in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

39. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have kept watch, and not allowed his house to be broken into.

40. Therefore you also be ready, for in an hour that you think not, the Son of Man comes."

41. Then Peter said to Him, "Lord, do You speak this parable only to us, or to all people?"

42. And the Lord said, "Who then is a faithful and wise manager, whom his master will make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?

43. Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.

44. Truly I say to you, that he will appoint him over all his possessions.

45. But if that servant says in his heart, 'My master is delaying his coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and be drunk,

46. the master of that servant will come on a day which he does not expect, and at an hour which he does not know, and he will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

47. And that servant who knew his master's will, and did not get ready or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many blows.

48. But he who did not know, yet did things worthy of blows, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been entrusted, of him they will ask much more.Christ Brings Division

49. "I have come to cast fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!

50. But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am till it is completed!

51. Do you think that I came to give peace on earth? I tell you, not at all, but rather division.

52. For from now on five in one house will be divided: three against two, and two against three.

53. Father will be divided against a son and a son against father, a mother against a daughter and a daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."Discerning the Times

54. Then He also said to the crowds, "Whenever you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A rainstorm is coming'; and so it happens.

55. And whenever you see the south wind blow, you say, 'There will be hot weather'; and it happens.

56. Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the earth and sky, but how is it you do not discern this time?

57. "And why do you not judge what is right, even of yourselves?

58. When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make an effort to make a settlement with him on the road, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the bailiff, and the bailiff throw you into prison.

59. I tell you, you shall by no means depart from there till you have paid the very last mite." 

## Luke 13

1. And some people were present at that very time, reporting to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.

2. And Jesus answered and said to them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things?

3. Not at all, I tell you; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that these were offenders more than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem?

5. Not at all, I tell you; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish."

6. He also spoke this parable: "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.

7. Then he said to the vinedresser, 'Look, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and I haven’t found any. Cut it down; why does it even waste the ground?'

8. But he answered and said to him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.

9. And if it produces fruit, fine. But if not, in the coming year, you can cut it down.' "Healing on the Sabbath

10. Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

11. And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over and was not able to straighten herself up.

12. And seeing her, Jesus called her to Him and said, "Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity."

13. And He laid His hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and was glorifying God.

14. But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, and he said to the crowd, "There are six days in which one should work; therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath day."

15. The Lord then answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it?

16. So ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound these eighteen years, should she not be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?"

17. And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things which were done by Him.The Kingdom of God

18. Then He said, "What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?

19. It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and put in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches."

20. Again He said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened."The Narrow Gate

22. And He was traveling through various cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.

23. Then one said to Him, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" And He said to them,

24. "Strive" Agonizo, Gk. Like it sounds, to agonize over, as Jesus did in the Garden of Gethsemane. Literally means to fight, or to struggle.“Strive to enter through the narrow gate, because many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

25. When once the Master of the house has risen up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open for us,' and answering He will say to you, 'I do not know you, where you are from.'

26. Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.'

27. But He will say, 'I tell you I do not know you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.'

28. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being cast out.

29. And they will come from the east and the west, and the north and the south, and will recline to eat in the kingdom of God.

30. And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last."

31. On that very day some Pharisees came, saying to Him, "Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill You."

32. And He said to them, "Go and say to that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.'

33. Nevertheless I must journey today, tomorrow, and the next day; for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.Jesus Laments over Jerusalem

34. "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!

35. See! Your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you shall "by no means" Ou me, Gk. Emphatic double negative in the Greek, signifying the absolute certainty of the statement. Translated by no means in the EMTV.by no means see Me until the time comes when you say, Psa 118:26'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!' " 

## Luke 14

1. Now it came to pass, when He came into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath, that they were watching Him closely.

2. And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy.

3. And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"

4. But they were silent. And taking hold of him, He healed him, and let him go.

5. Then He answered them, saying, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?"

6. And they were not able to answer Him regarding these things.Taking the Lowly Place

7. So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the places of honor, saying to them:

8. Whenever you are invited by someone to a wedding celebration, do not sit down in the place of honor, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;

9. and he who invited you and him shall come and say to you, 'Give place to this man,' and then you begin with shame to take the last place.

10. But when you are invited, go and sit down in the last place, so that when he who invited you comes, he shall say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then you will have glory in the presence of those who recline with you.

11. For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted."

12. Then He also said to him who invited Him, "When you give a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.

13. But whenever you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;

14. and you will be blessed, because they do not have anything to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the just."The Parable of the Great Supper

15. Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, "Blessed is he who shall eat breakfast in the kingdom of God!"

16. Then He said to him, "A certain man gave a great banquet, and he invited many,

17. and he sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, 'Come, for all things are now ready.'

18. But they all with one accord began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, 'I bought a field, and I must go and see it. I ask you, have me excused.'

19. And another said, 'I bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you, have me excused.'

20. Still another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'

21. So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.'

22. And the servant said, 'Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.'

23. Then the master said to the servant, 'Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.

24. For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper.' "Counting the Cost

25. Now great crowds were traveling with Him. And turning, He said to them,

26. If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.

27. And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.

28. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and count up the cost, whether he has the resources to complete it?

29. Lest perhaps after he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all those who see it begin to mock him,

30. saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'

31. Or what king, going to engage another king in battle, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?

32. Otherwise, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks the terms for peace.

33. So likewise, every one of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be My disciple.

34. "Salt is good; but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?

35. It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill, but men cast it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!" 

## Luke 15

1. Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.

2. And the Pharisees and scribes were grumbling, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."

3. And He told them this parable, saying,

4. What man among you, having a hundred sheep, and loses one of them, does not leave behind the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and goes after the one which is lost until he finds it?

5. And having found it, he puts it on his own shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And coming into the house, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'

7. I say to you that likewise there shall be more joy in heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety-nine righteous who need no repentance.The Parable of the Lost Coin

8. "Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?

9. And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost!'

10. Just so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."The Parable of the Prodigal Son

11. Then He said: "A certain man had two sons.

12. And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give to me the share of the wealth which falls to me.' So he divided to them his livelihood.

13. And not many days after, having gathered together all things, the younger son went on a journey to a distant country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.

14. But when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine throughout that country, and he began to be in need.

15. Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

16. And he was longing to fill his stomach with the carob pods which the swine were eating, and no one gave him anything.

17. But having come to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have an abundance of bread, and I am perishing with hunger!

18. I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,

19. and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants." '

20. And he arose and went to his father. But when he was still far off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.

21. And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.'

22. But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.

23. And bring the fatted calf here and slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry;

24. for this my son was dead and came to life, and he was lost and was found.' And they began to be merry.

25. “Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. And having summoned one of the servants, he was inquiring what these things might be.

27. And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and because he has received him back in good health, your father has killed the fatted calf.'

28. But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and began to plead with him.

29. So he answered and said to his father, 'Lo, so many years I have been serving you and I never transgressed your commandment; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.

30. But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fatted calf for him.'

31. And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.

32. But it was necessary to be merry and to rejoice, because your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.' " 

## Luke 16

1. He also said to His disciples: "There was a certain rich man who had a manager, and this manager was reported to him as squandering his possessions.

2. And calling him, he said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Render an account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'

3. "Then the manager said within himself, 'What shall I do? For my master is taking the management away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.

4. I know what I will do, so that whenever I am removed from the management, they will receive me into their houses.'

5. And having summoned each one of his master's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'

6. And he said, 'A hundred baths of olive oil.' So he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'

7. Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' So he said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'

8. So the master praised the unrighteous manager because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder in their own generation than the sons of light.

9. And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by the mammon of unrighteousness, so that whenever you fail, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.

10. He that is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in what is least is also unjust in much.

11. Therefore if you were not faithful with the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is genuine?

12. And if you were not faithful in what belongs to another, who will give to you what is yours?

13. No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."More Warnings about the Pharisees

14. Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were hearing all these things, and they were mocking Him.

15. And He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. Because that which is exalted among men is an abomination before God.

16. The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone enters forcibly into it.

17. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fail.

18. Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and everyone who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.The Rich Man and Lazarus

19. "Now there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, enjoying himself splendidly every day.

20. But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores, who had been placed at his gate,

21. and longing to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. And even the dogs came and would lick his sores.

22. And it came to pass that the beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.

23. And being in torments in "Hades" Hades, Gk. The realm of the undead. Hades translates the Hebrew word “Sheol”. This word is different than Gehenna, the place of punishment.Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. Then he cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am suffering in this flame.'

25. But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things, but now here he is comforted and you are suffering.

26. And besides all this, between us and you a great gulf has been fixed, so that those who desire to cross over from here to you are not able, nor may those from there cross over to us.'

27. Then he said, 'Therefore I beseech you, father, that you would send him to my father's house,

28. for I have five brothers, so that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.'

29. Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'

30. And he said, 'No, father Abraham; but if someone from the dead should go to them, they will repent.'

31. But he said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded should one rise from the dead.' " 

## Luke 17

1. Then He said to the disciples, "It is impossible for offenses not to come, but woe to the one through whom they do come!

2. It would be better for him if a millstone were around his neck, and he be cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

3. Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.

4. And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day he returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him."Jesus on Faith and Duty

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."

6. So the Lord said, "If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.

7. And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come and recline to eat'?

8. But will he not say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink'?

9. Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.

10. So likewise you, whenever you do all the things having been commanded to you, say, 'We are unprofitable servants. We have done what we ought to do.' "Ten Lepers Cleansed

11. And it happened while He was traveling to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood at a distance.

13. And they lifted their voice and said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"

14. And seeing them, He said to them, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And so it was that as they went away, they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, seeing that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,

16. and fell down on his face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.

17. So Jesus answered and said, "Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?

18. Were not any found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner?"

19. And He said to him, "Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well."The Coming of the Kingdom

20. Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation;

21. neither will they say, 'Look here!' or 'Look, there it is!' For behold, the kingdom of God is among you."

22. Then He said to the disciples, "Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you shall not see it.

23. And they will say to you, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' Do not go forth, nor follow them.

24. For just as the lightning which flashes out of the one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.

25. But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.

26. And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man.

27. They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

28. Likewise also as it happened in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;

29. but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.

30. In the same way it shall be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.

31. In that day, he who shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise he who is in the field, let him not turn back for the things left behind.

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Whoever seeks to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life shall preserve it.

34. I say to you, in that night two shall be on one bed: one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

35. Two shall be grinding together: one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

36. (This verse omitted in The Majority Text.)

37. And they answered and said to Him, "Where, Lord?" So He said to them, "Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together." 

## Luke 18

1. Then He spoke a parable to them, that one must always pray and not lose heart,

2. saying: "A certain judge was in a certain city, who did not fear God nor have regard for men.

3. Now there was a widow in that city; and she kept coming to him, saying, 'Give justice to me against my adversary.'

4. And he did not want to for a time; but afterward he said within himself, 'although I do not fear God, nor have regard for man,

5. yet because this widow bothers me I will give justice to her, lest she wear me out by forever coming to me.' "

6. Then the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge said.

7. And God, shall He not execute justice for His own elect, who cry out day and night to Him, and yet He is patient with them?

8. I tell you that He will execute justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector

9. Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised the others:

10. Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

11. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank You that I am not like other men—swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.

12. I fast twice a week, I tithe on all things, as many as I acquire.'

13. And the tax collector, standing far away, would not so much as lift his eyes towards heaven, but beat on his chest, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!'

14. I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted."Jesus Blesses Little Children

15. And they were bringing infants to Him, that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

16. But Jesus, summoning them, said, "Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Assuredly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter into it."The Rich Young Ruler

18. Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

19. So Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, that is, God.

20. You know the commandments: Ex 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20'DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,' 'DO NOT MURDER,' 'DO NOT STEAL,' 'DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS,' 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER.' "

21. And he said, "All these I have kept from my youth."

22. So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, "Still one thing you lack: sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."

23. But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.The Snare of Riches

24. And when Jesus saw that he became very sad, He said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!

25. For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."

26. And those who heard it said, "Who then is able to be saved?"

27. But He said, "These things which are impossible with men are possible with God."

28. Then Peter said, "See, we have left all and followed You."

29. So He said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life."Jesus a Third Time Foretells of His Death and Resurrection

31. Then taking the twelve aside, He said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.

32. For He will be betrayed to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon,

33. and having scourged Him, they will kill Him. And on the third day He will rise again."

34. But they understood none of these things; this saying was "hidden" Krupto, Gk. To hide or conceal. Figuratively, this word means that one is prevented from seeing, or a particular thing is “kept” from being seen, and hidden from one’s eyes.hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said.Jesus Heals a Blind Man

35. Now it came to pass, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat alongside the road begging.

36. And hearing a crowd traveling through the city, he asked what this was.

37. And they reported to him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.

38. And he shouted, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"

39. Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have pity on me!"

40. And having stopped, Jesus commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he drew near, He asked him,

41. saying, "What do you desire that I should do for you?" And he said, "Lord, that I may receive my sight."

42. Then Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has made you well."

43. And immediately he received his sight, and was following Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw this, gave praise to God. 

## Luke 19

1. And having entered, He passed through Jericho.

2. And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.

3. And he was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short "stature" Helikia, Gk. Noun meaning either physical/body stature, as here, or age, and lifespan, or age of maturity. (John 9:21) Consequently, there are varying opinions whether the word means physical stature, or age in Luke 2:52. Luke 12:25 also poses a problem for interpreters. Most scholars believe the word “cubit” (Pekus, Gk) in Luke 12:25 to mean “measure of time”, and not 18 inches, which certainly would not be “trivial.”stature.

4. And running up ahead in front, he went up into a sycamore tree so that he might see Him, because He was about to pass by that way.

5. And when He came upon that place, Jesus looked up and saw him, and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house."

6. So he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.

7. But when they saw it, they all were complaining, saying, "He has gone to be a guest with a sinner."

8. Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor; and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I restore fourfold."

9. And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;

10. for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."The Parable of the Minas

11. Now as they heard these things, He told another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately.

12. Therefore He said: "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.

13. And having called ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Do business till I come.'

14. But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We will not have this man to reign over us.'

15. And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded those servants to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, so that he might know who gained what by trading.

16. Then came the first, saying, 'Master, your mina has earned ten minas.'

17. And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant; because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.'

18. And the second came, saying, 'Master, your mina made five minas.'

19. Likewise he said to him, 'You also be over five cities.'

20. Then another came, saying, 'Master, behold your mina, which I had laid away in a handkerchief.

21. For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.'

22. And he said to him, 'Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I did not deposit, and reaping what I did not sow.

23. Why then did you not give my money to a bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?'

24. And he said to those standing by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.'

25. "But they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas.'

26. For I say to you that to everyone who has, more shall be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.

27. Nevertheless bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay them before me.' "The Triumphal Entry

28. And having said these things, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And it came to pass, as He drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, to the mountain which is called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,

30. saying, "Go into the village opposite you, in which when you enter you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has ever sat. Loose him and bring him here.

31. And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you loosing him?' thus you shall say to him, 'Because the Lord has need of him.' "

32. So those who were sent departed and found it just as He told them.

33. But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, "Why are you loosing the colt?"

34. And they said, "The Lord has need of him."

35. Then they brought him to Jesus. And when they threw their own clothes on the colt, they set Jesus on him.

36. And as He went, they were spreading their clothes under Him on the road.

37. And as He was approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,

38. saying: Psa 118:26"'BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!' Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"

39. And some of the Pharisees said to Him from the crowd, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."

40. But He answered and said to them, "I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out."Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem

41. And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it,

42. saying, "If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things pertaining to your peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.

43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and hem you in from every side,

44. and they will level you to the ground, and your children with you; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the season of your visitation."Jesus Cleanses the Temple

45. And when He entered into the temple, He began to drive out those buying and selling in it,

46. saying to them, "It is written, Isa 56:7'MY HOUSE IS A HOUSE OF PRAYER,' but you have made it a Jer 7:11'DEN OF THIEVES.' "

47. And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people were seeking to destroy Him,

48. and were unable to do anything; for all the people were very attentive to hear Him. 

## Luke 20

1. Now it came to pass on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, that the priests and the scribes, together with the elders, confronted Him,

2. and they spoke to Him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?"

3. But He answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one thing, and so tell Me:

4. The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men?"

5. And they debated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'

6. But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet."

7. So they answered that they did not know where it was from.

8. And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."The Parable of the Wicked Tenants

9. Then He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.

10. Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the farmers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers flogged him and sent him away empty-handed.

11. And again he sent another servant; and they flogged him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.

12. And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and threw him out.

13. Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps when they see him they will respect him.'

14. But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'

15. And casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

16. He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others." And when they heard it they said, "May it never be!"

17. Then He looked at them and said, "What then is this which is written: Psa 118:22'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED HAS BECOME THE CHIEF CORNERSTONE'?

18. "Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder."

19. And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour, but they were afraid—for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.The Question of Paying Taxes

20. And having watched Him closely, they sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on His words, in order to deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor.

21. Then they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth:

22. Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

23. But perceiving their craftiness, He said to them, "Why do you test Me?

24. Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?" They answered and said, "Caesar's."

25. And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."

26. But they could not catch Him in His words in front of the people. And marveling at His answer, they kept silent.The Question About the Resurrection

27. Then some of the Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, coming to Him and asked Him,

28. saying: "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and this man dies childless, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.

29. Now there were seven brothers. And the first, having taken a wife, died childless.

30. And the second took her as wife, and this man died childless.

31. Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and they died.

32. Last of all the woman died also.

33. Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife."

34. And Jesus answered and said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.

35. But those who have been counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;

36. nor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

37. Now even Moses revealed that the dead are raised, in the burning bush passage, when he called the Lord Ex 3:1-6,15'THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB.'

38. "For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all are alive to Him."

39. Then some of the scribes answered and said, "Teacher, You have spoken well."

40. But after that they dared not question Him anymore.The Question About the Son of David

41. And He said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?

42. Even David himself said in the Book of Psalms, Psa 110:1'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,

43. TILL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET." '

44. "Therefore David calls Him 'Lord'; how is He then his Son?"Beware of the Scribes

45. And as all the people listened, He said to His disciples,

46. Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk about in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at dinners,

47. who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation." 

## Luke 21

1. And looking up, He saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,

2. and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.

3. And He said, "Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all.

4. For all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood which she had."Jesus Predicts the Destruction of the Temple

5. Then, as some spoke about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said,

6. These things which you see—the days will come in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down."The Signs of the Times and the End of the Age

7. So they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?"

8. And He said: "Take heed that no one deceive you. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I AM,' and, 'The time has drawn near.' Therefore do not go after them.

9. But whenever you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately."

10. Then He said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful events and great signs from heaven.

12. But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and they will persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers on account of My name.

13. But it shall turn out for you for a testimony.

14. Put it then in your hearts not to practice beforehand giving your defense;

15. for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict, nor to withstand.

16. You will be betrayed even by parents and relatives, friends and brothers; and they will put some of you to death.

17. And you will be hated by all people for My name's sake.

18. But not a hair of your head shall "by any means" Ou me, Gk. Another emphatic declaration by the Lord, which Luke translates using the Greek double negative, signifying the absolute certainty of the thing spoken.by any means perish.

19. By your patient endurance you shall possess your souls.The Destruction of Jerusalem

20. "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has drawn near.

21. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the midst of her depart, and let not those who are in the fields enter into her.

22. For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that has been written.

23. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing a baby in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath among this people.

24. And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.The Coming of the Son of Man

25. "And there shall be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, as the sea and the waves roar,

26. men's hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming upon the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

27. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28. Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near."The Parable of the Fig Tree

29. Then He spoke to them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.

30. When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near.

31. So you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near.

32. Assuredly I say to you, this generation shall by no means pass away till all things are fulfilled.

33. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.Be Ready!

34. "But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and worries of life, and that Day come upon you unexpectedly.

35. For it will come as a snare on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.

36. Watch therefore, praying always that you may be counted worthy to escape everything that is about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."

37. And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet.

38. Then early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him. 

## Luke 22

1. Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover.

2. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.

3. Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve.

4. And he went off and spoke with the chief priests and captains about how he might betray Him to them.

5. And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.

6. And he promised, and was seeking an opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of the crowd.Preparations for the Passover

7. Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

8. And He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it."

9. So they said to Him, "Where do You desire that we shall prepare it?"

10. And He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goes in.

11. Then you shall say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?" '

12. And that man will show you a large, furnished upper room; there prepare it."

13. So they went and found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.The Institution of the Lord’s Supper

14. When the hour had come, He reclined to eat, and the twelve apostles with Him.

15. Then He said to them, "I have fervently desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;

16. for I say to you, that no longer will I eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."

17. Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves;

18. for I say to you, that I will by no means drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."

19. And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me."

20. Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.

21. Nevertheless behold, the hand of him that betrays Me is with Me on the table.

22. And indeed the Son of Man goes according to what is determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!"

23. Then they began to discuss with one another, which of them might be the one who was about to do this.The Disciples Argue About Greatness

24. And there arose also a dispute among them, as to which one of them was the greatest.

25. But He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called 'benefactors.'

26. But it is not this way with you; let the greatest among you, let him be as the youngest, and he who leads as he who serves.

27. For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.

28. Now you are those who have remained with Me in My trials.

29. And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,

30. so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial

31. And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon! Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he may "sift" Siniazo, Gk. Figuratively, meaning character refinement; to test out, or to take away the bad from the good.sift you as wheat.

32. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have "turned back" Epistrepho, Gk. Verb meaning turn, turn back, return. Also, it can mean to repent, or to be converted. The exact meaning here is debated.turned back, strengthen your brothers."

33. But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death."

34. Then He said, "I say to you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me."

35. And He said to them, "When I sent you without a money bag, and a knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything?" And they said, "Nothing."

36. Then He said to them, "But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise also a knapsack; and he who has no sword shall sell his garment and buy one.

37. For I say to you that this which has been written must still be accomplished in Me—the saying, Isa 53:12'AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH THE TRANSGRESSORS.' For the things concerning Me have a fulfillment."

38. So they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough."Jesus Prays in Gethsemane

39. And going out, He went to the Mount of Olives, according to His custom, and His disciples also followed Him.

40. And having come to the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."

41. And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,

42. saying, "Father, if You will, remove this cup from Me—nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done."

43. Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.

44. And being in "agony" Agonia, Gk. Used only here in NT (That is, in this form). Meaning, a great tension or inner conflict; anguish, and anxiety.agony, He prayed more fervently. Then His sweat became like "great drops of blood" Thromboi haimatos, Gk. Thick, clotted blood. Luke is using medical terms here to describe the agony and suffering of our Lord. A.T. Robertson calls this phrase common in the medical field; used by Aristotle.great drops of blood falling down onto the ground.

45. And rising up from prayer, coming to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.

46. Then He said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise up and pray, lest you enter into temptation."Betrayal and Arrest at Gethsemane

47. And while He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.

48. But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"

49. And those around Him, seeing what was about to happen, they said to Him, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"

50. And a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.

51. But Jesus answered and said, "Stop right there." And touching his ear, He healed him.

52. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, "Have you come out, as against a bandit, with swords and clubs?

53. When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."Peter Denies Jesus, Weeps Bitterly

54. And having arrested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter was following from a distance.

55. Now when they had lit a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat in their midst.

56. And a certain servant girl, seeing him sitting at the fire and gazing at him, said, "This man was also with Him."

57. But he denied Him, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him."

58. And after a little while another person saw him and said, "You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not!"

59. Then after about one hour had passed, another was firmly insisting, saying, "Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean."

60. But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying!" And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.

61. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."

62. And going outside, Peter wept bitterly.Jesus Mocked and Beaten

63. Now the men who were holding Jesus were mocking Him and beating Him.

64. And having blindfolded Him, they were striking His face and asking Him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?"

65. And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.Jesus and the Sanhedrin

66. And when it became day, the council of the elders of the people, the chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,

67. "If You are the Messiah, tell us." But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will by no means believe.

68. But if I also question you, you will by no means answer Me or release Me.

69. Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God."

70. Then they all said, "Are You then the Son of God?" So He said to them, "You rightly say that I am."

71. And they said, "What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth!" 

## Luke 23

1. Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this Man perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King."

3. Then Pilate questioned Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" He answered him and said, "You are saying what is so."

4. But Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this Man."

5. But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to here."Jesus and Herod

6. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean.

7. And when he found out that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.

8. Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he was hoping to see some miracle done by Him.

9. Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.

10. And the chief priests and scribes stood, vehemently accusing Him.

11. Then Herod, with his men of war, having treated Him with contempt, and having mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.

12. That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.Jesus or Barabbas?

13. And Pilate, having called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,

14. said to them, "You have brought this Man to me, on the charge of misleading the people. And indeed, when I examined Him in your presence, I found no guilt in this Man in the matters which you bring as charges against Him;

15. and neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.

16. Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release Him."

17. (for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).

18. But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas"—

19. who because of a certain insurrection having occurred in the city had been thrown into prison, and for murder.

20. Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.

21. But they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"

22. Then he said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has he done? I have found no guilt deserving death in Him. Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release Him."

23. But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.

24. So Pilate decided that their request should be carried out.

25. And he released whom they were requesting, who because of insurrection and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.Jesus Crucified

26. And as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, as he was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it behind Jesus.

27. And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also were mourning and lamenting Him.

28. But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

29. For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which did not give birth, and breasts which did not nurse!'

30. Then they will begin Hos 10:8'to say to the mountains, "FALL ON US!" and to the hills, "COVER US!" '

31. For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"

32. And they also were leading two others with Him, evildoers, to be put to death.

33. And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him and the evildoers, one on the right, and one on the left.

34. Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." And dividing His garments, they cast lots.

35. And the people stood, watching. And the rulers with them also were sneering, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the elect of God."

36. The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine,

37. and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself."

38. And an inscription also was written over Him, in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. Then one of the evildoers who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, "If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us."

40. But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?

41. And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this Man did nothing wrong."

42. Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingdom."

43. And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise."The Death of Jesus

44. Now it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.

45. Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.

46. And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "Father, Psa 31:5'INTO YOUR HANDS I WILL COMMIT MY SPIRIT.' " And after He said these things, He breathed His last.

47. And when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous Man!"

48. And all the crowds which came together for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, beat their own chests and returned.

49. But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.The Burial of Jesus

50. And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and righteous man

51. (this man had not agreed to their decision and deed), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.

52. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

53. And having taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth, and put it in a tomb cut out of rock, where no one had ever lain before.

54. That day was the Preparation; the Sabbath was drawing near.

55. And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was placed.

56. Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment. 

## Luke 24

1. And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.

2. But they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.

3. And going in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.

5. Then, as they became afraid and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,

7. saying, 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.' "

8. And they remembered His words.

9. And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.

10. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.

11. And their words seemed like nonsense before them, and they disbelieved them.

12. But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen strips lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.The Road to Emmaus

13. Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.

14. And they were conversing with one another about all these things which had happened.

15. So it was, as they were conversing and discussing, that Jesus Himself drew near and started to travel with them.

16. But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not recognize Him.

17. And He said to them, "What are these words which you are exchanging with one another as you walk, and you have a gloomy look?"

18. Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, "Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and do not know what has happened in it in these days?"

19. And He said to them, "What things?" So they said to Him, "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a man who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,

20. and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified Him.

21. But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.

22. Moreover certain women of our group astonished us, after they arrived early at the tomb.

23. And not finding His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive.

24. And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see."

25. Then He said to them, "O you foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!

26. Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?"

27. And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.The Disciples’ Eyes Opened

28. Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He made as though He was going farther.

29. But they constrained Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent." And He went in to stay with them.

30. Now it came to pass, as He was reclining to eat with them, having taken bread, He blessed and broke it, and He gave it to them.

31. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.

32. And they said to one another, "Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, and while He was interpreting the Scriptures to us?"

33. So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,

34. saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"

35. And they described the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.Jesus Appears to His Disciples

36. Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, "Peace to you."

37. But being alarmed and becoming fearful, they thought they saw a spirit.

38. And He said to them, "Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?

39. Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have."

40. When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.

41. But as they still disbelieved for joy, and marveled, He said to them, "Do you have any food here?"

42. So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.

43. And taking it, He ate it in their presence.Jesus’ Final Commission

44. Then He said to them, "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me."

45. And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.

46. Then He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,

47. and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. And you are witnesses of these things.

49. And behold, I am sending the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high."Jesus Taken up to Heaven

50. And He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands, He blessed them.

51. And it happened, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and was carried up into heaven.

52. And after they had worshiped Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

53. and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.
