# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the commandment of God our Saviour, and of Jesus Christ, our hope;

2. To Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. As I urged you when I went to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus, that you might warn certain men not to teach any other doctrine,

4. Nor to give heed to myths and endless genealogies, which promote useless speculation, rather than godly training, which is by faith.

5. Now the aim of this commandment is love from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and a sincere faith:

6. From which some have swerved, turning aside to vain discussion;

7. Desiring to be teachers of the law; but understanding neither what they say, nor the matters about which they make such confident assertions.

8. But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully;

9. Understanding this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

10. For adulterers, for those who defile themselves with men, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine;

11. According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

12. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, for he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

13. Though I was formerly a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a violent man: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

14. And the grace of our Lord overflowed for me, along with the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.

15. This is a trustworthy saying, and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am the foremost.

16. Yet for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might show forth his unlimited patience, as a pattern for those who would believe in him for eternal life.

17. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

18. This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies once made about you, that by them you might fight the good fight;

19. Holding on to faith and a good conscience; which some have rejected and so shipwrecked their faith:

20. Among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

## 1 Timothy 2

1. Therefore I urge, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;

2. For kings, and for all who are in authority; that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and reverence.

3. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

4. Who desires all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

5. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

6. Who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time.

7. And for this I have been appointed a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ and am not lying;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

8. Therefore, I want men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or dissension.

9. In like manner also, let women adorn themselves in proper apparel, modestly and soberly; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire;

10. But with good works, as becomes women professing godliness.

11. Let a woman learn in quietness and full submission.

12. I do not allow a woman to teach, or to have authority over a man; she must keep silent.

13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve;

14. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.

15. Yet women shall be kept safe through childbirth, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with propriety.

## 1 Timothy 3

1. This is a true saying, If a man desires the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.

2. An overseer must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, respectable, given to hospitality, able to teach;

3. Not given to wine, not combative, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money;

4. One who rules his own house well, having his children under control, commanding their respect in all ways;

5. (For if a man does not know how to manage his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)

6. Not a recent convert, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

7. Moreover, he must have a good reputation among those who are outside; lest he fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil.

8. Deacons, likewise, must be serious, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for gain;

9. Holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.

10. Let these be tested first; then, if blameless, let them serve as deacons.

11. In the same way, the women must be serious, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.

12. A deacon must be the husband of but one wife, ruling his children and his own house well.

13. For those who serve well in the office of deacon acquire for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in their faith in Christ Jesus.

14. These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly:

15. But if I tarry long, I write so you will know how you ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth.

16. And beyond question, great is the mystery of godliness: He was revealed in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.

## 1 Timothy 4

1. Now the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;

2. Taught by hypocritical liars; who have their consciences seared as with a hot iron;

3. Forbidding marriage, and commanding abstinence from foods which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

4. For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be refused, if it is received with thanksgiving:

5. For it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.

6. If you point out all these things to the brethren, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and of good doctrine, which you have been following.

7. But have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales, but rather train yourself in godliness;

8. For bodily exercise is of some value: but godliness is of value in all things, having promise in this life, and in that which is to come.

9. This is a faithful saying and worthy of full acceptance.

10. For this reason we both labour and strive, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of those who believe.

11. Command and teach these things.

12. Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.

13. Until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to exhortation, to doctrine.

14. Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophetic message when the body of elders laid hands upon you.

15. Diligently practice these things; give yourself wholly to them; so your progress may appear to all.

16. Take heed to yourself, and to your teaching; continue in them: for in doing this you shall save both yourself, and those who hear you.

## 1 Timothy 5

1. Do not rebuke an older man, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;

2. The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.

3. Honour widows who are widows indeed.

4. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home, and to repay their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.

5. Now she who is a widow indeed, and left all alone, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.

6. But she who lives in self-indulgence is dead while she lives.

7. And these things give as commands, that they may be blameless.

8. But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.

9. Let a widow be placed on the roll only if she is at least sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,

10. Having a reputation for good works; if she has brought up her children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has devoted herself to every good work.

11. But refuse to enroll the younger widows: for when their sensual desires cause them to disregard their dedication to Christ, they will marry;

12. Thus incurring condemnation, because they have cast aside their first pledge.

13. Besides, they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.

14. Therefore, I want the younger women to marry, bear children, guide the house, and give the adversary no occasion to speak reproachfully.

15. For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.

16. If any woman who believes has dependent widows, let her assist them, and let the church not be burdened; that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.

17. Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in preaching and teaching.

18. For the scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. And, The labourer is worthy of his wages.

19. Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.

20. Those who continue to sin, rebuke before all, that the others may fear.

21. I solemnly charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without favouring one over another, doing nothing with partiality.

22. Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, nor share in other men's sins: keep yourself pure.

23. No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and for your frequent ailments.

24. Some men's sins are evident, going before them to judgment; and for some men they appear later.

25. So also, good works are evident; and even those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.

## 1 Timothy 6

1. Let as many as are under the yoke of slavery count their masters as worthy of all honour, that the name of God and our teaching may be not defamed.

2. And those who have believing masters must not despise them because they are brethren; but rather service them all the more, because those who partake of their services are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.

3. If any man teaches otherwise, and does not consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching which accords with godliness;

4. He is proud, knowing nothing, but has an unhealthy craving for controversy and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions,

5. And wrangling among men of corrupt minds, who are destitute of the truth, and suppose that godliness is a means to gain.

6. But godliness with contentment is great gain.

7. For we brought nothing into this world, and we can carry nothing out.

8. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these.

9. But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction.

10. For the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil: and some, by craving it, have wandered from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

11. But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, and gentleness.

12. Fight the good fight of faith; lay hold on eternal life, to which you are called, to which you made the good confession before many witnesses.

13. I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession;

14. That you keep the commandment without spot, free of reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

15. Which he will bring about in his own time, he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

16. Who alone has immortality, dwelling in light which no man can approach; whom no man has seen, nor can see. To him be honour and power and dominion forever. Amen.

17. Command those who are rich in this world not to be arrogant, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly gives us all things to enjoy.

18. They are to do good, that they may be rich in good works, generous and willing to share;

19. Laying up for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.

20. O Timothy, guard that which has been entrusted to you. Avoid godless chatter and the contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge:

21. Which some have professed and thus erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
