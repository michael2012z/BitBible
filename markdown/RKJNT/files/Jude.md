# Jude

## Jude 1

1. Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called by God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:

2. May mercy, and peace, and love, be yours in abundance.

3. Beloved, while my whole concern was to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write and exhort you to earnestly contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.

4. For certain men have crept in secretly, who were long ago ordained for this condemnation; ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

5. Now I wish to remind you, though you already know all this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.

6. And the angels which did not keep their own domain, but left their proper abode, he has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the great day of judgment.

7. Just as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, which gave themselves over in a similar manner to sexual immorality, and to going after strange flesh, are set forth as an example of suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

8. Likewise, these dreamers defile the flesh, despise authority, and speak evil of the glorious ones.

9. Yet Michael the archangel, when he contended with the devil and argued over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.

10. But these men speak evil of things which they do not understand: but what they know by instinct, like brute beasts, by these things they corrupt themselves.

11. Woe to them! for they have gone the way of Cain, and for profit have plunged into the error of Balaam, and have perished in the rebellion of Korah.

12. These men are blemishes at your feasts of love, when they eat with you without fear: clouds without water, carried about by the winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

13. Raging waves of the sea, flinging up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackest darkness is reserved forever.

14. And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with myriads of his holy ones,

15. To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all who are ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh words which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

16. These are grumblers, complainers, following after their own lusts; and their mouths speak great swelling words, flattering people to gain an advantage.

17. But, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

18. They told you there would be mockers in the last time, who would walk after their own ungodly lusts.

19. These are the ones who cause division, worldly men who do not have the Spirit.

20. But you, beloved, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,

21. Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.

22. And have compassion on some, who are doubting:

23. Save others, pulling them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.

24. Now to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless in the presence of his glory with exceedingly great joy,

25. To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and majesty, dominion and authority, before all time, and now, and forevermore. Amen.
