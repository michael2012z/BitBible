# Acts

## Acts 1

1. In my former treatise, O Theophilus, I wrote of all that Jesus began to do and teach,

2. Until the day he was taken up, after he had, through the Holy Spirit, given commands to the apostles whom he had chosen.

3. To them he showed himself alive after his suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them over forty days, and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God:

4. And, while eating with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, of which, he said, you have heard me speak.

5. For John baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.

6. When they had come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?

7. And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has fixed by his own authority.

8. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the remotest part of the earth.

9. And when he had spoken these things, while they watched, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

10. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;

11. Who said, You men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall come in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven.

12. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

13. And when they had come in, they went into an upper room where they were staying; Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.

14. They all continued with one accord in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.

15. In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (together they were about a hundred and twenty,)

16. Brethren, this scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the guide to those who arrested Jesus.

17. For he was numbered with us, and had his part in this ministry.

18. (Now this man purchased a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst apart in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.

19. And it became known to all who dwelt in Jerusalem; so that the field is called in their tongue, Akeldama, that is to say, The field of blood.)

20. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation become desolate, and let no man live in it: and his office let another take.

21. Therefore, of those men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

22. Beginning with the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us, one of these must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.

23. And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which of these two you have chosen,

25. To take part in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas turned aside, that he might go to his own place.

26. And they drew lots for them; and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

## Acts 2

1. And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.

2. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. And there appeared to them tongues, as of fire, which separated and came to rest upon each of them.

4. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

5. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.

6. Now when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because every one heard them speak in his own language.

7. And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galilaeans?

8. And how is it we each hear them in our own tongue, in the language to which we were born?

9. Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,

10. Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and strangers from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabs, we hear them speak in our tongues of the mighty works of God.

12. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What does this mean?

13. Others said mockingly, These men are full of new wine.

14. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words:

15. For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day.

16. But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel;

17. And it shall come to pass in the last days, declares God, That I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:

18. And in those days I will pour out my Spirit on my menservants and on my maidservants; and they shall prophesy:

19. And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:

20. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord shall come:

21. And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

22. You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs, which God performed by him in your midst, as you yourselves know:

23. This man, being delivered up by the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.

24. But God has raised him up, having freed him from the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it.

25. For David speaks of him, I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be shaken:

26. Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover my flesh shall also abide in hope:

27. Because you will not leave my soul in Hades, neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.

28. You have made known to me the ways of life; you shall make me full of joy with your presence.

29. Brethren, let me say confidently to you of the patriarch David; that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.

30. Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath that he would seat one of his descendants upon his throne;

31. He foresaw this and spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.

32. This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.

33. Therefore, being exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured forth this, which you now see and hear.

34. For David did not ascend into the heavens: but he himself says, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand,

35. Until I make your foes a footstool for your feet.

36. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.

37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?

38. Then Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For the promise is for you, and for your children, and for all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

40. And with many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.

41. Then those who received his word were baptized: and that same day there were added to their number about three thousand souls.

42. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayer.

43. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.

44. And all who believed were together, and had all things in common;

45. And they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all men, as every man had need.

46. And they continued daily to assemble in the temple, and to break bread from house to house, and to eat their food with gladness and sincerity of heart,

47. Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

## Acts 3

1. Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.

2. And a certain man, lame from his mother's womb, was being carried to the temple gate which is called Beautiful, where they laid him daily to ask for alms from those who entered into the temple;

3. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms.

4. And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look at us.

5. And he gave his attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. Then Peter said, Of silver and gold I have none; but what I have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!

7. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankles received strength.

8. And leaping up he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

10. And they knew that it was the one who sat begging for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.

11. And as he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly amazed.

12. And when Peter saw it, he answered the people, You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? or why do you look so earnestly at us, as though by our own power or holiness we made this man walk?

13. The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to let him go.

14. But you denied the Holy and Just One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you;

15. And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead. Of this we are witnesses.

16. And his name, through faith in his name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know: and the faith which is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.

17. And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your rulers.

18. But those things which God foretold by the mouths of all his prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he has fulfilled.

19. Therefore repent, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;

20. And that he may send the Christ, who was appointed for you, even Jesus:

21. Whom heaven must receive until the time of the restoration of all things which God has spoken about by the mouths of all his holy prophets since the most ancient times.

22. For Moses said, The Lord your God shall raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren; you shall hear him in all things, whatever he shall say to you.

23. And it shall come to pass, that anyone who will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.

24. Yea, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days.

25. You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

26. God, having raised up his servant, sent him first to bless you, by turning every one of you away from your iniquities.

## Acts 4

1. And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them.

2. They were indignant that they taught the people, and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

3. And they laid hands on them, and put them in prison until the next day: for it was already evening.

4. Yet many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.

5. And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,

6. And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and Jonathan, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

7. And when they had set them in their midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have you done this?

8. Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, You rulers of the people, and elders,

9. If we are to be examined this day about a good deed done to a cripple, by what means he was made well;

10. Then let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him does this man stand here before you well.

11. This is the stone which was rejected by you builders, but which has become the very cornerstone.

12. And there is salvation in no one else: for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we must be saved.

13. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.

14. And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

15. But when they had commanded them to go aside, out of the council, they conferred among themselves,

16. Saying, What shall we do with these men? for that a notable miracle has indeed been done by them is apparent to everyone who lives in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

17. But that it may spread no further among the people, let us sternly warn them, that they speak no more to any man in this name.

18. And they called them, and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.

19. But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge for yourselves.

20. But we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

21. So when they had threatened them further, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people: for everyone glorified God for what had been done.

22. For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was performed.

23. And being let go, they went to their own people, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.

24. And when they heard this, they lifted up their voices to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are he who made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them:

25. Who by the mouth of our father David said, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine vain things?

26. The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

27. For truly in this city, against your holy servant Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together,

28. To do whatever your hand and your counsel predestined to be done.

29. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to your servants that they may speak your word with all boldness,

30. while you stretch forth your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.

31. And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.

32. And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and of one soul: and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common.

33. And with great power the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

34. Nor were any among them lacking: for as many as owned land or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,

35. And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made to each according to his need.

36. And Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas, (which means, The son of encouragement,)

37. Sold a field he owned, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

## Acts 5

1. But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property,

2. And, with his wife's knowledge, kept back part of the price, and brought a certain part of it, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?

4. While it was unsold, was it not your own? and even after it was sold, was not the money in your own power? why have you conceived this deed in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.

5. On hearing these words Ananias fell down and died: and great fear came on all those who heard these things.

6. And the young men arose, wrapped him up, and carried him out, and buried him.

7. And it was about three hours later, when his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.

8. And Peter said to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for that much.

9. Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed to test the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out as well.

10. Then she immediately fell down at his feet, and died: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.

11. And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.

12. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders being performed among the people; and they were all together in Solomon's porch.

13. And none of the rest dared join them: but the people held them in great esteem.

14. And even more believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.

15. So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and mats, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall upon some of them.

16. There also came a multitude from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were all healed.

17. Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him, (that is, the party of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,

18. And laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the public jail.

19. But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,

20. Go, stand in the temple and declare to the people all the words of this life.

21. And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the morning, and taught. Now the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, the full senate of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

22. But when the officers arrived, and did not find them in the prison, they returned, and reported,

23. We found the prison quite securely shut, and the guards standing at the doors: but when we opened them, we found no one within.

24. Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed and wondered what would come of this.

25. Then someone came and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.

26. Then the captain with the officers went, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people might stone them.

27. And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,

28. Did we not sternly command you that you should not teach in this name? and, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

29. Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.

31. God has exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

32. And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.

33. When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and wanted to kill them.

34. But then there stood up in the council a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who had a good reputation among all the people, and he commanded that the apostles be put outside for a while;

35. And he said to them, You men of Israel, take care what you intend to do about these men.

36. For before these days Theudas rose up, who boasted of being somebody; and a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him. He was slain; and all those who followed him were scattered, and brought to nothing.

37. After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all those who followed him were dispersed.

38. And now I say to you, Stay away from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work is from men, it will come to nothing:

39. But if it is from God, you cannot overthrow it; you might even be found fighting against God.

40. And they agreed with him: and when they had called in the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

41. And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

42. And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease to teach and preach Jesus as the Christ.

## Acts 6

1. And in those days, when the number of the disciples was increasing, there arose a murmuring among the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution of food.

2. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not right that we should neglect the word of God to serve tables.

3. Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

4. But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.

5. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.

6. These they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

7. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

8. And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.

9. Then there arose some from what is called the synagogue of the Freedmen, including Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, and disputed with Stephen.

10. But they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.

11. Then they secretly instigated men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.

12. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,

13. And they set up false witnesses, who said, This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:

14. For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.

15. And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

## Acts 7

1. Then the high priest said, Are these things so?

2. And he said, Brethren and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran,

3. And said to him, Depart from your country, and from your family, and come into the land which I shall show you.

4. Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Harran: and from there, when his father was dead, God sent him into this land, in which you now live.

5. And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not even enough to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though as yet he had no child.

6. And God spoke to this effect, That his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land; and that they would bring them into bondage, and mistreat them for four hundred years.

7. And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage I will judge, said God: and after that they shall come forth, and serve me in this place.

8. And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.

9. And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,

10. And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; who made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

11. Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers could find no food.

12. But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.

13. And at the second time Joseph made himself known to his brothers; and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh.

14. Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and for all his family, seventy-five in all.

15. So Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,

16. And they were carried over into Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Emmor, the father of Shechem.

17. But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

18. Until another king arose, who knew nothing of Joseph.

19. He dealt treacherously with our race, and mistreated our fathers, forcing them to expose their young children, that they might not live.

20. At this time Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair in God's sight, and he was cared for in his father's house for three months:

21. And when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and raised him as her own son.

22. And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.

23. When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.

24. And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck the Egyptian:

25. For he supposed his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance by his hand: but they did not understand.

26. And the next day he appeared to some as they fought, and tried to reconcile them, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?

27. But he who was doing his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?

28. Do you want to kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?

29. At this remark, Moses fled, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.

30. And when forty years had passed, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.

31. When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came to him,

32. Saying, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not look.

33. Then the Lord said to him, Take the sandals off your feet: for the place where you stand is holy ground.

34. I have surely seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and have come down to deliver them. Now come, and I will send you to Egypt.

35. This Moses whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? was the one God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.

36. He brought them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and at the Red sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.

37. This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, The Lord your God shall raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren.

38. This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on mount Sinai, and with our fathers: and he received the living oracles to give to us.

39. Our fathers would not obey him, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again to Egypt,

40. Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.

41. And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

42. Then God turned away and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Was it to me you offered slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

43. You took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, figures which you made to worship: therefore I will carry you away beyond Babylon.

44. Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, made according to the pattern appointed by the one who spoke to Moses.

45. Our fathers then brought it in with Joshua when they took possession of the land of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before our fathers. And so it remained there until the days of David;

46. Who found favour with God, and desired to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

47. But it was Solomon who built him a house.

48. Yet the most High does not dwell in temples made with hands; as the prophet says,

49. Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will you build for me? says the Lord: or what is the place in which I can rest?

50. Has not my hand made all these things?

51. You stiffnecked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so you do.

52. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? and they killed those who told beforehand of the coming of the Righteous One; whom you have now betrayed and murdered:

53. You who have received the law as delivered by angels, and have not kept it.

54. When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him.

55. But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,

56. And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

57. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,

58. And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.

59. And as they stoned Stephen he called upon God, saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And he knelt down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

## Acts 8

1. And Saul was consenting to his death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.

3. As for Saul, he ravaged the church, entering into every house, and dragging off men and women and committing them to prison.

4. Therefore, those who were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.

5. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.

6. And the people with one accord gave heed to the things of which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miraculous signs which he did.

7. For unclean spirits, crying out with loud voices, came out of many who were possessed: and many taken with paralysis, and those who were lame, were healed.

8. And there was great joy in that city.

9. But there was a certain man, named Simon, who formerly practiced sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great:

10. And they all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.

11. And they gave heed to him, because for so long he had amazed them with sorceries.

12. But when they believed Philip as he preached about the good news of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

13. Even Simon himself believed: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and was amazed, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.

14. Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:

15. Who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:

16. (For as yet he had fallen upon none of them: they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

17. Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

18. And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,

19. Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.

20. But Peter said to him, Your silver perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

21. You have no part or portion in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God.

22. Therefore, repent of this wickedness, and pray to God, that perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.

23. For I perceive that you are full of bitterness, and in the bondage of iniquity.

24. Then Simon answered, Pray to the Lord for me, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.

25. And when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

26. And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road.

27. And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,

28. Was returning, and sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.

29. Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join this chariot.

30. And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?

31. And he said, How can I, unless some man should guide me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

32. Now the passage of scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb silent before his shearer, so he did not open his mouth:

33. In his humiliation justice was taken from him: and who shall describe his generation? for his life was taken from the earth.

34. And the eunuch answered Philip, I pray you, of whom does the prophet speak? of himself, or of some other man?

35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at the same scripture, preached Jesus to him.

36. And as they went on their way, they came to some water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what prevents me from being baptized?

37. [And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.]

38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

39. And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more: but he went on his way rejoicing.

40. But Philip found himself at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.

## Acts 9

1. And Saul, still breathing out threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,

2. And asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

3. And as he traveled, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there flashed around him a light from heaven:

4. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

5. And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.

6. Arise, and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.

7. And the men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no one.

8. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing: so they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.

9. And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.

10. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.

11. And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he is praying,

12. And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hands on him, that he might regain his sight.

13. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:

14. And he is here and has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon your name.

15. But the Lord said to him, Go: for he is a chosen instrument of mine, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the sons of Israel:

16. I will show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake.

17. And Ananias went his way, and entered the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me, that you might regain your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.

18. And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales: and he received his sight, and arose, and was baptized.

19. And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul was for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus.

20. And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, saying that he is the Son of God.

21. But all who heard him were amazed, and said; Is this not the one who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and did he not come here that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?

22. But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, by proving that Jesus is the Christ.

23. And after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him:

24. But their plot was made known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night to kill him.

25. Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down in a basket through an opening in the wall.

26. And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them, freely coming and going in Jerusalem.

29. And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed with the Hellenistic Jews: but they attempted to kill him.

30. When the brethren learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.

31. Then the church had rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and was being built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers.

32. And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.

33. And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was a paralytic.

34. And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.

35. And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.

36. Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which translated is Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and acts of charity.

37. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.

38. And since Lydda was near to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent to him two men, urging him to come to them and not delay.

39. Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper room: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.

40. But Peter put them all out, and knelt down, and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

41. And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.

42. And it became known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.

43. And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.

## Acts 10

1. There was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,

2. A devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, and he gave many alms to the people, and prayed to God always.

3. About the ninth hour of the day he saw in a vision an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.

4. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have come up as a memorial before God.

5. Now send men to Joppa, and bring back one Simon, whose surname is Peter:

6. He lodges with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.

7. And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier from among those who waited upon him continually;

8. And when he had explained all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.

9. On the next day, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:

10. And he became very hungry, and wanted to eat: but while they were making ready, he fell into a trance,

11. And saw heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners to the earth:

12. In it were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and creeping things, and birds of the air.

13. And a voice came to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

14. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.

15. And the voice spoke to him a second time, What God has cleansed, do not call unholy.

16. This was done three times: and the sheet was immediately taken up again into heaven.

17. Now while Peter was perplexed about the meaning of the vision which he had seen, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made enquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,

18. And called out, asking whether Simon, known as Peter, was lodging there.

19. While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.

20. Arise therefore, and go downstairs, and accompany them without doubting: for I have sent them.

21. Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him by Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am the one you seek: what is the cause for which you have come?

22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one who fears God, and who is well spoken of among all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear a message from you.

23. Then he called them in, and gave them lodging. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

24. And the day after they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.

25. And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.

26. But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I am also a man.

27. And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many who had come together.

28. And he said to them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to keep company, or visit one from another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.

29. Therefore, I came to you without objection, as soon as I was sent for: therefore I ask for what intent you have sent for me?

30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago about this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,

31. And said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered by God.

32. Therefore send to Joppa, and ask for Simon, who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of one Simon, a tanner, by the sea.

33. Therefore I immediately sent to you; and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all present here before God, to hear all things that you have been commanded by the Lord.

34. Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality:

35. But in every nation the man who fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted by him.

36. The word which God sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)

37. You know that word, which was proclaimed throughout all Judaea, beginning in Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;

38. How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: how he went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.

39. And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem. And they killed him by hanging him on a tree:

40. But God raised him up on the third day, and showed him openly;

41. Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.

42. And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who was ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and dead.

43. To him all the prophets bear witness that through his name whoever believes in him shall receive forgiveness of sins.

44. While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word.

45. And those of the circumcision who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out upon the Gentiles.

46. For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter said,

47. Can anyone forbid water for these to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?

48. And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain for a few days.

## Acts 11

1. Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

2. And when Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision party criticized him,

3. Saying, You went into the house of uncircumcised men, and ate with them.

4. But Peter related the matter from the beginning, and explained it to them in order, saying,

5. I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain object descended, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me:

6. When I had fastened my eyes upon it and considered it, I saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and birds of the air.

7. And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; kill and eat.

8. But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.

9. But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, do not call unholy.

10. And this happened three times: and then all was drawn up again into heaven.

11. And, behold, immediately three men arrived at the house where I was, sent from Caesarea to me.

12. And the Spirit told me to go with them, without doubting. And these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man's house:

13. And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is called Peter;

14. Who shall give you a message, by which you and all your household shall be saved.

15. And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as upon us in the beginning.

16. Then I remembered the word of the Lord, that he said, John baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

17. Therefore, if God gave them the same gift he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, that I could withstand God?

18. When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.

19. Now those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose over Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews.

20. But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.

22. Then news of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas to Antioch.

23. When he came, and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and exhorted them all, that with resolute hearts they would cling to the Lord;

24. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added to the Lord.

25. Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to look for Saul:

26. And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they met with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

27. And in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. And one of them named Agabus stood up, and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine throughout all the world: and this came to pass in the days of Claudius.

29. Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren who lived in Judaea:

30. Which they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to mistreat some who belonged to the church.

2. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

3. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the days of unleavened bread.)

4. And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers to keep him; intending after passover to bring him forth to the people.

5. Therefore Peter was kept in prison: but prayer to God was made for him without ceasing by the church.

6. And the night before Herod would have brought him forth, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door were guarding the prison.

7. And, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the prison: and he struck Peter on the side, and woke him, saying, Arise quickly. And the chains fell off his hands.

8. And the angel said to him, Gird yourself, and put on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Wrap your garment about you, and follow me.

9. And he went out, and followed him; but he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real; but thought he was seeing a vision.

10. When they were past the first and second guards, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city; which opened for them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.

11. And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent his angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.

12. When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was also called Mark; where many were gathered together praying.

13. And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.

14. And when she recognized Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.

15. And they said to her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was so. Then they said, It is his angel.

16. But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.

17. But he, beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things to James, and to the brethren. Then he departed, and went to another place.

18. Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.

19. And when Herod sought for him, and did not find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and remained there.

20. And Herod was highly displeased with the people of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain, their friend, they asked for peace; because their country was fed by the king's country.

21. And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal robes, sat upon his throne, and made an oration to them.

22. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.

23. Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory: and he was eaten by worms, and died.

24. But the word of God grew and spread.

25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry, bringing with them John, who was also called Mark.

## Acts 13

1. Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

2. As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.

3. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands upon them, they sent them away.

4. So, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, they departed to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.

5. And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they also had John to assist them.

6. And when they had gone through the whole island and had come to Paphos, they found a certain Jewish sorcerer, a false prophet, whose name was Bar-Jesus:

7. Who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.

8. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name translated) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

9. Then Saul, (who is also called Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes upon him,

10. And said, You who are full of all deceit and all villainy, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

11. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.

12. Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

13. Now when Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.

14. But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.

15. And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

16. Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.

17. The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they lived in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he brought them out of it.

18. And for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness.

19. And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for the space of four hundred and fifty years.

20. And after that he gave them judges, until Samuel the prophet.

21. And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.

22. And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who shall fulfill all my will.

23. Of this man's descendants God, according to his promise, has raised up for Israel a Saviour, Jesus.

24. Before his coming John had preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

25. And as John was finishing his course, he said, Who do you think I am? I am not he. But, behold, one comes after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.

26. Brethren, sons of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the word of this salvation.

27. For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the words of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, have fulfilled these by condemning him.

28. And though they found no cause for death in him, yet they asked Pilate that he be slain.

29. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.

30. But God raised him from the dead:

31. And he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.

32. And we declare to you good news, that the promise which was made to the fathers,

33. God has fulfilled to us, their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day I have begotten you.

34. And concerning the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to decay, he spoke in this way, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.

35. Therefore, he says in another psalm, You shall not allow your Holy One to see decay.

36. For David, after he had served the will of God in his generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption:

37. But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

38. Therefore, let it be known to you, brethren, that through this man the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you:

39. And by him all who believe are justified from all the things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.

40. Beware, therefore, lest that which is spoken of in the prophets come upon you;

41. Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish: for I am doing a work in your days, a work which you shall by no means believe, though a man declare it to you.

42. And as they went out of the synagogue, the people begged that these words might be told to them the next sabbath.

43. Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout converts followed Paul and Barnabas: who spoke to them, urging them to continue in the grace of God.

44. And the next sabbath day almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.

45. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and contradicted those things which were spoken by Paul, and reviled him.

46. Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should have first been spoken to you: but seeing that you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

47. For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation to the ends of the earth.

48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were appointed for eternal life believed.

49. And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region.

50. But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.

51. But they shook the dust off of their feet against them, and went to Iconium.

52. And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 14

1. And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.

2. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the brethren.

3. Therefore, for a long time they remained there, speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

4. But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.

5. And when there was an attempt made by both the Gentiles, and the Jews with their rulers, to abuse them, and to stone them,

6. They learned of it, and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region:

7. And there they preached the gospel.

8. Now there sat a certain man at Lystra without strength in his feet; he was a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.

9. He heard Paul speak: and Paul, who steadfastly beheld him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

10. Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped up and walked.

11. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.

12. And they called Barnabas, Zeus; and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.

13. Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have offered a sacrifice with the people.

14. When the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they tore their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,

15. Men, why do you these things? We also are men of the same nature as you, and we preach to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them.

16. In times past he allowed all nations to walk in their own ways;

17. Nevertheless, he did not leave himself without a witness, in that he did good, and gave you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.

18. And even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.

19. And certain Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, who, having persuaded the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing he was dead.

20. Yet, as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

21. And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made disciples of many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,

22. Strengthening the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through much tribulation we must enter the kingdom of God.

23. And when they had appointed elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord, in whom they believed.

24. And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

25. And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia:

26. And from there sailed to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now fulfilled.

27. And when they had come, and had gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

28. And they stayed a long time there with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. And certain men who came down from Judaea taught the brethren, saying, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.

2. Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.

3. And being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling of the conversion of the Gentiles: and they brought great joy to all the brethren.

4. And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, and by the apostles and elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.

5. But some from the sect of the Pharisees who had believed, rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.

6. And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.

7. And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Brethren, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

8. And God, who knows the heart, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did to us;

9. And he made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

10. Now then, why do you put God to the test by putting a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

11. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, just as they will.

12. Then all the multitude kept silence, and listened as Barnabas and Paul declared what miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them.

13. And after they had finished, James answered, Brethren, listen to me:

14. Simeon has declared how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.

15. And with this the words of the prophets agree; as it is written,

16. After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; I will build again the ruins, and I will set it up:

17. That the rest of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, who are called by my name,

18. Says the Lord, who makes these things known from of old.

19. Therefore, my judgment is that we do not trouble those who have turned to God from among the Gentiles:

20. But that we write to them, to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from sexual immorality, and from things strangled, and from blood.

21. For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who preach him, for he is read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

22. Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to choose men from their own company to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; so they sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders among the brethren:

23. And they sent this letter with them; The brethren, both apostles and elders, send greetings to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:

24. Since we have heard that some, to whom we gave no such commandment, went out from us and have troubled you with their words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law:

25. It seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. Men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who shall tell you the same things by mouth.

28. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;

29. That you abstain from foods offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you shall do well. Farewell.

30. So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter:

31. When they had read it, the people rejoiced at the exhortation.

32. And Judas and Silas, being prophets themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and strengthened them.

33. And after they had remained there a time, they were let go in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them.

34. [But it pleased Silas to remain there.]

35. But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, along with many others.

36. And some days later Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are.

37. And Barnabas wanted to take with them John, called Mark.

38. But Paul did not think it good to take him with them, for he had deserted them in Pamphylia, and did not continue with them in the work.

39. And the disagreement was so sharp between them, that they separated from each other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;

40. And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.

41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

## Acts 16

1. Then he came to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman, who was Jewish, and believed; but his father was a Greek;

2. And he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.

3. Paul wanted him to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.

4. And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees, that were ordained by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.

5. And so the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.

6. Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,

7. After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

8. And passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.

9. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, pleading with him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.

10. And after he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavoured to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.

11. Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came on a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis;

12. And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a Roman colony: and we remained in that city some days.

13. And on the sabbath we went out of the city to the riverside, where we expected there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spoke to the women who gathered there.

14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart, so she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.

15. And when she was baptized, and her household, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house, and stay there. And she persuaded us.

16. And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain slave girl possessed by a spirit of divination met us, and she brought her masters much gain by fortune-telling:

17. She followed Paul and us, and cried out, These men are servants of the most high God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.

18. And this she did for many days. But Paul, being greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that same hour.

19. And when her masters saw that their hope for profit was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,

20. And having brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, are troubling our city exceedingly,

21. And they teach customs which are not lawful for us Romans to accept, or to observe.

22. And the multitude also rose up against them: and the magistrates tore the clothes off of them, and commanded that they be beaten with rods.

23. And when they had struck them with many blows, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely:

24. And he, having received this charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

25. And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.

26. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.

27. And the keeper of the prison awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.

28. But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here.

29. Then he called for a light, and rushed in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,

30. And brought them out, and said, Men, what must I do to be saved?

31. And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, you and your household.

32. And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.

33. And he took them that same hour of the night, and washed their wounds; and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.

34. And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced with all his household, because they believed in God.

35. And when it was day, the magistrates sent officers, saying, Let those men go.

36. And the keeper of the prison told this to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.

37. But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly, uncondemned, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they send us away secretly? no indeed; let them come themselves and fetch us out.

38. And the officers told these words to the magistrates: and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.

39. And they came to appease them, and brought them out, and asked them to depart from the city.

40. So they went out of the prison, and entered the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them, then departed.

## Acts 17

1. Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews:

2. And Paul, as his manner was, went in to them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures,

3. Explaining and proving, that Christ needed to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and saying, this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is the Christ.

4. And some of them believed, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the chief women.

5. But the Jews who did not believe were moved with envy, and took certain wicked fellows of the rabble, and gathered a crowd, and set all the city in an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.

6. And when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also;

7. And Jason has welcomed them: and they do all that is contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.

8. And the people and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.

9. And when they had taken security from Jason, and from the others, they let them go.

10. And the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived they went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so.

12. Therefore, many of them believed; together with not a few prominent Greek women, and many men as well.

13. But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was being preached by Paul at Beroea, they came there also, and stirred up the people.

14. Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away to the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.

15. And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.

16. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

17. Therefore, he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with those who happened to be there.

18. Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What is this babbler trying to say? and others, He seems to be a proclaimer of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.

19. And they took him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which you speak?

20. For you bring certain strange things to our ears: therefore we want to know what these things mean.

21. (For all the Athenians, and the strangers there, spent their time in nothing else, but telling, or hearing something new.)

22. Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious.

23. For as I passed by, and beheld the objects of your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, what you worship as unknown, this I declare to you.

24. The God who made the world and all things in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;

25. Neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, for he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things;

26. And he has made from one all nations of men to live on all the face of the earth, and has determined their allotted times, and the boundaries of their habitation;

27. That they should seek God, in the hope that they might grope for him, and find him, though he is not far from every one of us:

28. For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as some of your own poets have said, For we also are his offspring.

29. Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, formed by art and man's imagination.

30. Those times of ignorance God overlooked; but now he commands all men everywhere to repent:

31. Because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom he has ordained; and he has given assurance of this to all men by raising him from the dead.

32. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again on this matter.

33. So Paul departed from among them.

34. Yet certain men joined him, and believed: among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

## Acts 18

1. After these things Paul departed from Athens, and went to Corinth;

2. And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to see them.

3. And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for they were tentmakers by occupation.

4. And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

5. And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself to preaching, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.

6. And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his clothing, and said to them, May your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.

7. And he departed from there, and entered a certain man's house, named Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next to the synagogue.

8. And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household; and many of the Corinthians heard and believed, and were baptized.

9. Then the Lord spoke to Paul at night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not hold your peace:

10. For I am with you, and no man shall attack and hurt you: for I have many people in this city.

11. And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

12. And when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,

13. Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.

14. And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to bear with you:

15. But if it is a question of words and names, and of your own law, look to it yourselves; for I will not be a judge of such matters.

16. And he drove them from the judgment seat.

17. Then they all took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.

18. And after this Paul remained there many days longer, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed from there to Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. He cut his hair in Cenchrea: for he had made a vow.

19. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

20. When they asked him to remain longer with them, he did not consent;

21. But bade them farewell, saying, I will return to you, if God wills. And he sailed from Ephesus.

22. And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, then went down to Antioch.

23. And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went throughout the region of Galatia and on through Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.

24. Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

25. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and diligently taught the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.

26. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: and when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

27. And when he wanted to go to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to welcome him: and when he had come, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed:

28. For he mightily refuted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.

## Acts 19

1. And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,

2. He said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they said to him, We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.

3. And he said to them, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.

4. Then Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus.

5. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.

7. And there were about twelve of them in all.

8. And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.

9. But when some were hardened, and did not believe, but spoke evil of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, took away the disciples, and held discussions daily in the school of Tyrannus.

10. And this continued for two years; so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

11. And God performed extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:

12. So that handkerchiefs or aprons he had touched were brought to the sick, and diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.

13. Then certain of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, We command you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.

14. There were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who were doing this.

15. And the evil spirit answered, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?

16. And the man who had the evil spirit leaped on them, subdued them and overcame them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

17. And this became known to all the Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

18. And many who believed came, and confessed, and disclosed their deeds.

19. Many of those who used magic arts brought their books together, and burned them before all: and they counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

20. So the word of God grew and prevailed mightily.

21. After these things had ended, Paul resolved in the spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.

22. So he sent to Macedonia two of those who had ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus; but he stayed in Asia for a while.

23. And about that time there arose no small stir about the way.

24. For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;

25. These he called together, along with workmen of similar occupations, and said, Men, you know that by this craft we have our wealth.

26. Moreover you see and hear, that not only in Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods at all:

27. So not only is our craft in danger of being discredited; but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may count for nothing, and her magnificence may be degraded, she whom all Asia and the world worships.

28. And when they heard this, they were filled with rage, and cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

29. And the whole city was filled with confusion: and dragging Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia and Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.

30. Paul wanted to enter in among the people, but the disciples would not let him.

31. And certain of the chief officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him, asking him not to venture into the theatre.

32. Some cried out one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and most of them did not know why they had come together.

33. And some of the multitude called upon Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defence to the people.

34. But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice for about two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

35. And when the town clerk had calmed the people, he said, Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from heaven?

36. Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.

37. For you have brought here these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of our goddess.

38. Therefore, if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a complaint against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them bring charges against one another.

39. But if you require anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.

40. For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause we can give to justify this disorder.

41. And when he had spoken thus, he dismissed the assembly.

## Acts 20

1. And after the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, and after exhorting them, he embraced them and departed to go to Macedonia.

2. And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece,

3. And there he remained three months. And when the Jews laid in wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.

4. And he was accompanied into Asia by Sopater of Beroea, son of Pyrrhus; and the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and from Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

5. These went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.

6. And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.

7. And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, and because he intended to depart the next day; he continued his speech until midnight.

8. And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.

9. And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep: and as Paul kept talking, he was overcome by sleep, and fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.

10. And Paul went down, and bent over him, and embraced him saying, Do not trouble yourselves; for his life is in him.

11. When Paul came up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, he talked a long while, even until the break of day, then he departed.

12. And they took the young man home alive, and were not a little comforted.

13. And we went ahead to the ship, and sailed to Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there: for so he had directed, intending himself to go by foot.

14. And when he met with us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.

15. And we sailed from there, and arrived the next day opposite Chios; and the following day we crossed over to Samos; and the next day we came to Miletus.

16. For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, because he did not want to spend time in Asia: for he was making haste, so that if possible, he would be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.

17. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called for the elders of the church.

18. And when they had come to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I have lived among you at all times,

19. Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews:

20. How I kept back nothing that was profitable for you, but have taught you publicly, and from house to house,

21. Testifying both to the Jews, and to the Greeks, of repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.

22. And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:

23. Except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, that bonds and afflictions await me.

24. But I do not count my life as precious to myself, so that I might finish my course, and the ministry, which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.

25. And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

26. Therefore, I testify to you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of all men.

27. For I have not hesitated to declare to you all the counsel of God.

28. Take heed for yourselves, and for all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.

29. For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

30. And from among your own selves men shall arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.

31. Therefore watch, and remember, that for three years I did not cease to warn every one night and day with tears.

32. And now, brethren, I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

33. I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

34. You yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to the needs of those who were with me.

35. I have shown you in all things, that by labouring in this manner you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words the Lord Jesus himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

36. And when he had spoken thus, he knelt down, and prayed with them all.

37. And they all wept bitterly, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,

38. Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.

## Acts 21

1. And it came to pass, that after we parted from them, and had set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the following day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara:

2. And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.

3. Now when we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on our left, and sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unload its cargo.

4. And finding disciples, we remained there seven days: and they kept saying to Paul by the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.

5. And when our days there had ended, we departed and went our way; and they all accompanied us on our way, with wives and children, until we were out of the city: and we knelt down on the shore, and prayed.

6. Then when we had taken leave of one another, we got on the ship; and they returned home again.

7. And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day.

8. The next day we departed, and went to Caesarea: and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven; and stayed with him.

9. And he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.

10. And while we remained there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.

11. When he had come to us, he took Paul's belt, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

12. When we heard these things, both we, and the people of that place, begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. Then Paul answered, What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.

15. And after those days we packed our baggage, and went up to Jerusalem.

16. There also went with us certain of the disciples of Caesarea, who brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.

17. And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.

18. The following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.

19. And when he had greeted them, he declared in detail the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.

20. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe; and they are all zealous for the law:

21. And they have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after our customs.

22. What then is to be done? for they will surely hear that you have come.

23. Therefore, do this that we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow;

24. Them take, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses, that they may shave their heads: thus all will know that those things, of which they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk in obedience to the law.

25. As for the Gentiles who believe, we have written with our decision that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.

26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purified himself with them, then entered the temple to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and an offering should be made for each one of them.

27. And when the seven days had almost ended, the Jews who were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,

28. Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: and further, he has also brought Greeks into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.

29. (For they had earlier seen him in the city with Trophimus, an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

30. And all the city was aroused, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut.

31. And as they tried to kill him, word came to the commander of the Roman garrison, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

32. He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them: and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.

33. Then the commander came near, and arrested him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and asked who he was, and what he had done.

34. Some among the multitude cried out one thing, some another: and when he could not learn the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be brought to the barracks.

35. And when he came to the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the people.

36. For the multitude of people followed, crying out, Away with him.

37. And as Paul was to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, May I speak to you? And he replied, Can you speak Greek?

38. Are you not that Egyptian, who some time ago caused a rebellion, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men who were murderers?

39. But Paul said, I am a Jew from Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city: and, I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.

40. And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,

## Acts 22

1. Brethren, and fathers, hear my defence which I make to you now.

2. And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept silent: and he said,

3. I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, and was zealous for God, as you all are this day.

4. And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,

5. As the high priest and all the council of the elders can bear witness. For I received from them letters to the brethren, and I went to Damascus to take those who were there and bring them bound to Jerusalem, to be punished.

6. And it came to pass, that as I made my journey, and had come near to Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light around me.

7. And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

8. And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.

9. And those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.

10. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told to you all things which are appointed for you to do.

11. And since I could not see because of the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.

12. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good reputation among all the Jews who lived there,

13. Came to me, and stood, and said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And that very hour I could see him.

14. And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will, and to see the Just One, and to hear the voice of his mouth.

15. For you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.

16. And now why do you delay? arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.

17. And it came to pass, that when I had come again to Jerusalem, while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance;

18. And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and quickly get out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.

19. And I said, Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you:

20. And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the garments of those who killed him.

21. And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.

22. And until this word they listened to him, then they lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.

23. And as they were crying out, and waving their garments, and throwing dust into the air,

24. The commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and directed that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know why they cried out against him so.

25. And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?

26. When the centurion heard that, he went and told the commander, saying, Take heed what you do: for this man is a Roman.

27. Then the commander came, and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes.

28. And the commander answered, I obtained this citizenship with a great sum of money. And Paul said, But I was born a citizen.

29. Then immediately those who would have examined him departed from him; and the commander was also afraid after he learned that he was a Roman and that he had bound him.

30. On the next day, because he wanted to know exactly why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

## Acts 23

1. And Paul, earnestly looking at the council, said, Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

2. And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.

3. Then Paul said to him, God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall: do you sit to judge me according to the law, yet contrary to the law command me to be struck?

4. And those who stood by said, Do you revile God's high priest?

5. Then Paul said, I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.

6. But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: it is for the hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.

7. And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the assembly was divided.

8. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angels, or spirits: but the Pharisees acknowledge both.

9. And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' party arose, and argued vigorously, saying, We find no evil in this man: what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?

10. And when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.

11. And the next night the Lord stood by him, and said, Take courage: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.

12. And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

13. And there were more than forty who made this conspiracy.

14. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great oath, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.

15. Now therefore, you and the council notify the commander to bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you would enquire more thoroughly concerning him: and we, before he ever comes near, are ready to kill him.

16. And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered the barracks, and told Paul.

17. Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Take this young man to the commander: for he has a certain thing to tell him.

18. So he took him, and brought him to the commander, and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.

19. Then the commander took him by the hand, and drew him aside privately, and asked, What is it that you have to tell me?

20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the council, as though they would enquire of him more thoroughly.

21. But do not yield to them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men, who have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him: and now they are ready, waiting for a promise from you.

22. So the commander let the young man depart, and charged him, Tell no man that you have revealed these things to me.

23. And he called two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea, at the third hour of the night;

24. And provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.

25. And he wrote a letter after this manner:

26. Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.

27. This man was taken by the Jews, and would have been killed by them: then I came with the troops, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.

28. And when I wanted to learn the reason they accused him, I brought him down to their council:

29. And I perceived that he was accused regarding questions of their law, but there was no charge against him worthy of death or imprisonment.

30. And when I was told that there was a plot against the man, I immediately sent him to you, and also commanded his accusers to state before you whatever they have against him.

31. Then the soldiers, as it was commanded, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.

32. On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.

33. When they came to Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul before him.

34. And when he had read the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia;

35. He said, I will hear you when your accusers have come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.

## Acts 24

1. And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with some of the elders, and with a certain lawyer named Tertullus, who informed the governor of their charges against Paul.

2. And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that because of you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy reforms are done for this nation by your provision,

3. We accept this always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.

4. But, that I may not be further tedious to you, I ask that by your clemency you would hear a few words from us.

5. For we have found this man to be a pestilent fellow, and a agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

6. He has also tried to profane the temple: but we seized him, [and would have judged him according to our law.

7. But Lysias the commander came upon us, and with great violence took him out of our hands,

8. Commanding his accusers to come to you.] By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth of all these things of which we accuse him.

9. And the Jews agreed with the accusation, saying that these things were so.

10. Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned for him to speak, answered: Because I know that you have been for many years a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defence.

11. As you may ascertain, it has been no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

12. And neither in the temple, or in the synagogues, or in the city did they find me disputing with any man, or stirring up the people:

13. Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.

14. But this I confess to you, that according to the way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets,

15. And have hope toward God, which they themselves also have, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

16. So I discipline myself, to always have a clear conscience before God and men.

17. Now, after many years, I came to bring to my nation alms and offerings.

18. I was purified when they found me doing this in the temple, without a crowd or a tumult. But certain Jews from Asia were there,

19. Who ought to be here before you, and object, if they have anything against me.

20. Or else let these men here say if they found any wrongdoing in me when I stood before the council,

21. Unless it be for this one thing, that I cried out while standing among them, For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you this day.

22. And Felix, having a more accurate knowledge of the way, put them off, saying, When Lysias the commander shall come down, I will decide your case.

23. And he commanded a centurion to guard Paul, and to let him have some liberty, and that he should not prevent his friends from ministering to him.

24. And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning faith in Christ Jesus.

25. And as he reasoned with them about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was frightened, and answered, Go your way for now; when I have a convenient opportunity, I will call for you.

26. He also hoped that Paul would give him money: therefore he sent for him often, and conversed with him.

27. But after two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus: and Felix, wanting to do a favour for the Jews, left Paul imprisoned.

## Acts 25

1. Now three days after Festus had come into the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

2. Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews brought to him charges against Paul, and begged him,

3. Asking as a favour, that he would have him brought to Jerusalem, for they were planning an ambush to kill him along the way.

4. But Festus answered, that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would soon depart for there.

5. Therefore, let the influential ones among you go down with me, and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him.

6. And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, commanded Paul to be brought.

7. And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, and brought many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.

8. Paul answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any way.

9. But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favour, answered Paul, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged about these charges before me?

10. Then Paul said, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.

11. If I am an offender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die: but if there is no truth to the things of which these men accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.

12. Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.

13. And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.

14. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's case to the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix:

15. About whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a judgment against him.

16. I answered them, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before he who is accused meets the accusers face to face, and has the opportunity to defend himself concerning the crime laid against him.

17. Therefore, when they had come here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.

18. When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed:

19. But had certain disagreements with him about their own superstition, and about one Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul claimed to be alive.

20. And because I was at a loss how to investigate such questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and be judged there about these matters.

21. But when Paul appealed to be held for a decision by the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.

22. Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would like hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him.

23. So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came, with great pomp, and entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city. At Festus' command, Paul was brought forth.

24. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem, and also here, crying out that he ought no longer to live.

25. But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he has appealed to the emperor, I have determined to send him.

26. But I have nothing definite to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination, I might have something to write.

27. For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to specify the crimes laid against him.

## Acts 26

1. Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:

2. I consider myself fortunate, king Agrippa, because I shall make my defence this day before you regarding all the things of which I am accused by the Jews:

3. Especially because I know you to be an expert in all customs and controversies of the Jews: therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.

4. The manner of my life from my youth, which was at first spent among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.

5. They have known me for a long time, and, if they are willing to testify to it, that I lived as a Pharisee, according to the most strict sect of our religion.

6. And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers:

7. The promise which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God day and night, hope to attain. For the sake of this hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.

8. Why should it be thought incredible to any of you, that God should raise the dead?

9. I truly thought to myself, that I ought to do many things to oppose to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

10. And this I did in Jerusalem: and I had many of the saints shut up in prison, by authority of the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.

11. And I punished them often in every synagogue, and tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged against them, I persecuted them even in foreign cities.

12. Thus engaged, I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests.

13. At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.

14. And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? it is hard for you to kick against the goads.

15. And I said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.

16. But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in which I will appear to you.

17. I will deliver you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,

18. To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance along with those who are sanctified by faith in me.

19. Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:

20. But declared first to those of Damascus, then at Jerusalem, and throughout all the regions of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and perform deeds worthy of repentance.

21. For these reasons the Jews caught me in the temple, and tried to kill me.

22. Having obtained help from God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing other than what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:

23. That Christ would suffer, and that he would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the people, and to the Gentiles.

24. And as he spoke thus in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are raving; your great learning is making you mad.

25. But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.

26. For the king knows of these things, and before him I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.

27. King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.

28. Then Agrippa said to Paul, In such a short time do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian?

29. And Paul said, I would to God, that in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might be as I am, except for these chains.

30. The king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them:

31. And when they had withdrawn, they talked among themselves, saying, This man has done nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.

32. Then Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.

## Acts 27

1. And when it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan cohort.

2. And boarding a ship of Adramyttium, we put out to sea, meaning to sail to ports on the coast of Asia; and Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.

3. The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him liberty to go to his friends, that they might care for him.

4. And when we had put out to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

5. And when we had sailed over the sea by the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.

6. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy; and he put us aboard.

7. And when we had sailed slowly for many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, the wind would not allow us to go on, so we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone;

8. And, with difficulty passing it, came to a place which is called The fair havens; near the city of Lasea.

9. Much time had been spent, and the sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was already past, so Paul admonished them,

10. And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be disastrous, with much damage, not only to the cargo and ship, but also to our lives.

11. But the centurion believed the pilot and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

12. And because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to put out to sea from there, in hopes of reaching Phoenix, a harbour of Crete, which faces toward the southwest and northwest, and wintering there.

13. And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed close along the shore of Crete.

14. But not long after there arose a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster.

15. And when the ship was caught, and could not make headway into the wind, we let her be driven along.

16. And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we had much work to secure the ship's boat.

17. When they had taken it up, they used ropes to undergird the ship; and, fearing lest they should run into the sandbars of Syrtis, let down the sea anchor, and so were driven along.

18. As we were exceedingly tossed by the tempest, the next day they threw the cargo overboard;

19. And the third day they cast out the ship's tackle with their own hands.

20. And when neither sun nor stars appeared in many days, and no small tempest lay upon us, all hope that we should be saved was abandoned.

21. Then as they had been long without food, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Men, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and incurred this damage and loss.

22. But now I encourage you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only the ship will be lost.

23. For this night there stood before me an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,

24. Saying, Do not fear, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all those who sail with you.

25. Therefore, men, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be exactly as I was told.

26. Yet we must be cast upon a certain island.

27. But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven about on the Sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were approaching land;

28. And took soundings, and found the water was twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it was fifteen fathoms.

29. Then fearing lest we should run upon the rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

30. As the sailors were about to flee the ship, and had let down the ship's boat into the sea, pretending they would cast out anchors from the bow,

31. Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes to the boat, and let her fall away.

33. And when day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and in fasting, having taken nothing.

34. Therefore I urge you to take food; this is for your strength. Not a hair shall perish from the head of any of you.

35. And when he had spoken thus, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.

36. Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took some food.

37. In all, there were two hundred and seventy-six of us in the ship.

38. And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by casting the wheat into the sea.

39. And when it was day, they did not recognize the land: but they saw a certain bay with a beach, onto which they intended, if it were possible, to drive the ship.

40. So they cast off the anchors, and left them in the sea, and loosening the rudder ropes, they hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.

41. But striking a sandbar, they ran the ship aground; and the bow stuck fast, and remained immovable, and the stern was broken apart by the violence of the waves.

42. And the soldiers planned to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away, and escape.

43. But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that those who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:

44. Then the rest should follow, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safely to land.

## Acts 28

1. And when they had escaped, then we learned that the island was called Malta.

2. And the native people showed us unusual kindness: for they kindled a fire, and welcomed every one of us, because it had begun to rain and was cold.

3. And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.

4. And when the natives saw the creature hanging on his hand, they said to themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, and though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow him to live.

5. And he shook off the creature into the fire, and suffered no harm.

6. They expected he would have swollen up, or suddenly fallen down dead: but after they watched a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

7. In the same vicinity were estates owned by the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who welcomed us, and courteously entertained us for three days.

8. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick, afflicted with a fever and dysentery: Paul went in to see him, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

9. When this was done, the others on the island who had diseases, came, and were healed.

10. And they honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they put on board everything we needed.

11. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose figurehead was Castor and Pollux.

12. And landing at Syracuse, we remained there three days.

13. And from there we circled around and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we arrived the next day at Puteoli,

14. Where we found brethren, and were asked to remain with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.

15. And when the brethren there heard of us, they came to meet us, as far as Appii forum and The three taverns: when Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.

16. And when we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him.

17. And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief men of the Jews together: and when they had come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.

18. When they had examined me, they would have let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death.

19. But when the Jews spoke against it, I was forced to appeal to Caesar; not that I had any charge to bring against my own nation.

20. Therefore, for this reason I have called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because it is for the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.

21. And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who have come here reported or spoken any evil against you.

22. But we desire to hear from you what your views are: for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.

23. And when they had appointed a day, many came to him in his lodging; to whom he explained and testified of the kingdom of God, trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.

24. And some believed the things which were spoken, and some did not believe.

25. And when they could not agree among themselves, they departed, after Paul spoke one last statement, Well did the Holy Spirit speak by Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,

26. Saying, Go to this people, and say, You shall keep hearing, and shall not understand; and keep seeing, but not perceive:

27. For the heart of this people has grown calloused, and with their ears they barely hear, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, that I should heal them.

28. Therefore let it be known to you, that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.

29. [And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had a great dispute among themselves.]

30. And he lived two years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to see him,

31. Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all boldness, and no man hindered him.
