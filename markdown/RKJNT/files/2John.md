# 2 John

## 2 John 1

1. The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not only I, but also all those who know the truth,

2. For the sake of the truth, which dwells in us, and shall be with us forever:

3. Grace, mercy, and peace, shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

4. I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.

5. And now I urge you, lady, not as though I were writing a new commandment to you, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.

6. And this is love, that we walk in obedience to his commandments. This is the commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in love.

7. For many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist.

8. Look to yourselves, that you do not lose those things which we have worked for, but that you may receive a full reward.

9. Whoever runs too far ahead, and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. He who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son.

10. If anyone comes to you, and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, or give him any encouragement:

11. For he who encourages him is a partaker in his evil deeds.

12. Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

13. The children of your chosen sister greet you.
