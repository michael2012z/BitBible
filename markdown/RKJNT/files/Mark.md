# Mark

## Mark 1

1. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

2. As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way.

3. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

4. John baptized in the wilderness, and preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

5. And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and all those of Jerusalem, and they were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

6. And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather girdle about his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey;

7. And preached, saying, After me there comes one mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.

8. I have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

9. And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

10. And immediately as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

11. And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

12. And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.

13. And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.

14. Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,

15. And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent and believe the gospel.

16. Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.

17. And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.

18. And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him.

19. And when he had gone a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in their boat mending their nets.

20. And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.

21. And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

22. And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.

23. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

24. Saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.

25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.

26. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried out with a loud voice, it came out of him.

27. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? what a new teaching this is! for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.

28. And immediately his fame spread throughout all the region around Galilee.

29. And as soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

30. Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him of her.

31. And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she waited upon them.

32. And at evening, when the sun set, they brought to him all who were diseased, and those who were possessed by devils.

33. And all the city was gathered together at the door.

34. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many devils; and did not permit the devils to speak, because they knew him.

35. And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed to a solitary place, and there he prayed.

36. And Simon, and those who were with him, hunted for him.

37. And when they found him, they said to him, Everyone is seeking for you.

38. And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for that is why I have come.

39. And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.

40. And a leper came to him, begging him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean.

41. And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I will; be clean.

42. And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.

43. And he sternly charged him, and immediately sent him away;

44. He said to him, See that you say nothing to any man: but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.

45. But he went out, and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the matter abroad, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a city, but stayed out in lonely places: and they came to him from every quarter.

## Mark 2

1. And he entered Capernaum again after some days; and it was reported that he was in the house.

2. And immediately many gathered together, so that there was no room to receive them, no, not even around the door: and he preached the word to them.

3. And they came, bringing a paralytic, who was borne by four men.

4. And when they could not come near to him because of the crowd, they made a hole in the roof where he was: and when they had broken through, they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay.

5. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven.

6. But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, who reasoned in their hearts,

7. Why does this man speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?

8. And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?

9. Which is easier to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up your mat, and walk?

10. But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he said to the paralytic,)

11. I say to you, Arise, and take up your mat, and go home.

12. And immediately he arose, took up the mat, and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this.

13. And he went forth again on the seashore; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.

14. And as he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.

15. And it came to pass, that, as Jesus reclined at table in his house, many tax gatherers and sinners also sat together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.

16. And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with tax gatherers and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with tax gatherers and sinners?

17. When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.

18. Now the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting: and they came and said to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?

19. And Jesus said to them, Can the attendants of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

20. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.

21. No man sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment: because the new patch pulls away from the old, and the tear is made worse.

22. And no man puts new wine into old wineskins: because the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined: but new wine must be put into new wineskins.

23. And it came to pass, that he went through the grainfields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the heads of grain.

24. And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath day?

25. And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and those who were with him?

26. How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave also to them who were with him?

27. And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:

28. Therefore, the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

## Mark 3

1. And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.

2. And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.

3. And he said to the man who had the withered hand, Stand and come here.

4. And he said to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.

5. And when he had looked around on them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored.

6. And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

7. But Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him; and also from Judaea,

8. And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon; a great multitude, when they heard the many things he did, came to him.

9. And he told his disciples that a boat should be ready for him because of the multitude, lest they should crowd him.

10. For he had healed many; so as many as had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.

11. And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying, You are the Son of God.

12. And he sternly commanded them that they should not make him known.

13. And he went up to the mountain, and called to him those he wanted: and they came to him.

14. And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,

15. And to have authority to cast out devils:

16. Simon, whom he called Peter;

17. And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; to whom he gave the surname Boanerges, which means, Sons of thunder:

18. And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,

19. And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. And they went into a house.

20. And the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.

21. And when his family heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.

22. And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He is possessed by Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils he casts out devils.

23. And he called them to himself, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?

24. If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

25. And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

26. And if Satan rises up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.

27. No man can enter into a strong man's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.

28. Truly I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they shall speak:

29. But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit shall never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:

30. Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.

31. Then his brothers and mother came, and, standing outside, sent to him, calling him.

32. And the multitude sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers are outside seeking for you.

33. And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brothers?

34. And he looked around at those who sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!

35. For whoever shall do the will of God is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

## Mark 4

1. And again he began to teach by the seaside: and a great multitude gathered around him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in it; and the whole multitude was on the shore.

2. And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching,

3. Listen; Behold, a sower went out to sow:

4. And it came to pass, as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds of the air came and devoured it.

5. And some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil:

6. But when the sun came up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.

7. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

8. And other seed fell on good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundredfold.

9. And he said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

10. And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him about the parable.

11. And he said to them, To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those who are outside, all these things are done in parables:

12. That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven.

13. And he said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?

14. The sower sows the word.

15. And these are the ones by the wayside, where the word is sown; when they have heard, Satan comes immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in them.

16. And likewise, these are the ones who are like seed sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;

17. But have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake, they immediately fall away.

18. And these are the ones who are like seed sown among thorns; they hear the word,

19. And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust for other things enter in, and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

20. And these are the ones who are like seed sown on good ground; they hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundredfold.

21. And he said to them, Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?

22. For there is nothing hidden, which shall not be revealed; nor is anything kept secret that shall not come to light.

23. If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.

24. And he said to them, Take heed what you hear: with the measure you use, it shall be measured to you: and more besides.

25. For he who has, to him shall more be given: and he who has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.

26. And he said, The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the ground;

27. And goes to sleep and rises, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows up, though he does not know how.

28. For the earth brings forth fruit by itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.

29. But when the grain is ripe, immediately he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.

30. And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or what parable shall we use for it?

31. It is like a grain of mustard seed, which is the smallest seed planted in the ground:

32. But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all garden herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the birds of the air may nest under the shadow of it.

33. And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.

34. And he did not speak to them without a parable: and when they were alone, he explained all things to his disciples.

35. And the same day, when evening had come, he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side.

36. And when they had sent the multitude away, they took him just as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other boats.

37. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was almost swamped.

38. And he was in the stern, asleep on a pillow: and they awoke him, and said to him, Teacher, do you not care that we perish?

39. And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

40. And he said to them, Why are you so fearful? how is it that you have no faith?

41. And they were exceedingly fearful, and said to one another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

## Mark 5

1. And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Garasenes.

2. And when he got out of the boat, immediately there met him from out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

3. Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not even with chains:

4. Because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and he had pulled apart the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces: no man could subdue him.

5. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying out, and cutting himself with stones.

6. But when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed before him,

7. And cried out with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I implore you by God, that you do not torment me.

8. For he was saying to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.

9. And he was asking him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.

10. And he begged him much that he would not send them out of the country.

11. Now there was a great herd of swine feeding there on the hillside.

12. And all the devils begged him, saying, Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.

13. And Jesus gave them permission. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (there were about two thousand;) and they were drowned in the sea.

14. And those who fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened.

15. And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been possessed by the devil, who had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

16. And those who saw it told what happened to the man who was possessed by the devil, and to the swine.

17. And they began to beg him to depart from their region.

18. And as he got into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the devil begged him that he might go with him.

19. Yet Jesus did not let him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he has had compassion on you.

20. And he departed, and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all the people were amazed.

21. And when Jesus crossed over again by boat to the other side, many people gathered around him: and he was near the sea.

22. And, behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

23. And begged him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: I beg you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed and live.

24. And Jesus went with him; and many people followed him, and crowded him.

25. And a certain woman, who had a flow of blood for twelve years,

26. And had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not helped, but rather grew worse,

27. When she heard of Jesus, came in the crowd from behind, and touched his garment.

28. For she said, If I just touch his clothes, I shall be healed.

29. And immediately the flow of blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction.

30. And Jesus, immediately knowing that power had gone out of him, turned around in the crowd, and said, Who touched my clothes?

31. And his disciples said to him, You see the multitude crowding you, and you say, Who touched me?

32. And he looked around to see the woman who had done this thing.

33. But the woman, knowing what had happened in her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.

34. And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.

35. While he was speaking, messengers came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble the Teacher further?

36. As soon as Jesus heard what was spoken, he said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be afraid, only believe.

37. And he allowed no man to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.

38. And he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw the tumult, and those who wept and wailed greatly.

39. And when he had come in, he said to them, Why do you make this tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleeps.

40. And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with him, and entered in where the child was.

41. And he took her by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cum; which means, Little girl, I say to you, arise.

42. And immediately the girl arose, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were completely astonished.

43. And he strictly ordered them that no one should know of this; and told them to give her something to eat.

## Mark 6

1. And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples followed him.

2. And when the sabbath day came, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many who heard him were astonished, saying, Where did this man get these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such miracles are performed by his hands?

3. Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joseph, of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended by him.

4. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

5. And he could do no miracles there, except to lay his hands upon a few sick people, and heal them.

6. And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went among the villages, teaching.

7. And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth two by two; and gave them authority over unclean spirits;

8. And commanded them to take nothing for their journey, except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts:

9. But to wear sandals; and not to put on two tunics.

10. And he said to them, Wherever you enter a house, abide there until you depart from that place.

11. And whoever will not receive you, or hear you, when you depart from there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.

12. And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

13. And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.

14. And King Herod heard of it; (for his name was spread abroad). And some said that John the Baptist had risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works showed themselves forth in him.

15. Others said, He is Elijah. And others said, He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.

16. But when Herod heard of it, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he has risen from the dead.

17. For Herod himself had John arrested, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.

18. For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.

19. Therefore Herodias had a grudge against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:

20. For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and kept him safe; and when he heard him, he was perplexed, but he enjoyed listening to him.

21. But an opportunity came on Herod's birthday, when he had a banquet for his lords, high captains, and chief men of Galilee;

22. When the daughter of Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.

23. And he swore to her, Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half of my kingdom.

24. And she went out, and said to her mother, For what shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

25. And she came immediately in haste to the king, and asked, saying, I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.

26. The king was exceedingly sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for the sake of those who sat with him, he would not refuse her.

27. So immediately the king sent an executioner with orders that his head be brought. He went and beheaded him in the prison,

28. And brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl: and she gave it to her mother.

29. And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.

30. And the apostles gathered together with Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.

31. And he said to them, Come by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.

32. And they departed privately by boat to a lonely place by themselves.

33. And the people saw them departing, and many recognized them, and ran there on foot from all the cities, and got there before them.

34. And Jesus, when he came ashore, saw many people, and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.

35. And when the day was almost gone, his disciples came to him, and said, This is a lonely place, and it is very late:

36. Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy bread for themselves: for they have nothing to eat.

37. He answered and said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii of bread, and give it to them to eat?

38. He said to them, How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they found out, they said, Five, and two fish.

39. And he commanded them to make all the people sit down in groups upon the green grass.

40. And they sat down in groups, by hundreds, and by fifties.

41. And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fish he divided among them all.

42. And they all ate, and were filled.

43. And they picked up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fish.

44. And there were about five thousand men who ate of the loaves.

45. And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the people away.

46. And when he had sent them away, he departed to a mountain to pray.

47. And when evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.

48. And he saw them toiling at their rowing; for the wind was against them: and about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed them by.

49. But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it was a ghost, and cried out:

50. For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them, Take heart: it is I; do not be afraid.

51. And he joined them in the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were amazed beyond measure.

52. For they did not understand the miracle of the loaves: for their hearts were hardened.

53. And when they passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.

54. And when they had come out of the boat, immediately people recognized him,

55. And ran throughout that whole region, and began to carry the sick about on mats, to wherever they heard he was.

56. And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and begged him that they might even touch the fringe of his garment: and as many as touched him were made well.

## Mark 7

1. Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem, gathered around him.

2. And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault.

3. (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands, thus holding to the tradition of the elders.

4. And when they come from the market, unless they wash, they do not eat. And there are many other traditions which they observe, such as the washing of cups, and pots, and vessels of copper.)

5. Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but rather eat bread with unwashed hands?

6. He answered and said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honours me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.

7. In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

8. Laying aside the commandment of God, you hold to the traditions of men.

9. And he said to them, You fully reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.

10. For Moses said, Honour your father and your mother; and, Whoever curses father or mother, let him be put to death:

11. But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, whatever I have that might benefit you is Corban, that is to say, a gift to God,

12. Then you do not allow him to do anything for his father or his mother;

13. Thus making the word of God invalid through your tradition, which you have handed down: and you do many such things.

14. And when he had called all the people to him, he said to them, Listen to me, every one of you, and understand:

15. There is nothing from outside of a man that can defile him by entering into him: but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile the man.

16. [If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.]

17. And when he entered into the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable.

18. And he said to them, Are you also without understanding? Do you not perceive, that whatever enters into the man from without, it cannot defile him;

19. Because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and is eliminated? Thus he declared all foods clean.

20. And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.

21. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,

22. Covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lustfulness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness:

23. All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

24. And from there he arose, and went into the regions of Tyre, and entered into a house, and would not have anyone know it: but he could not be hidden.

25. But a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

26. The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth; and she begged him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

27. But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not right to take the children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs.

28. And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.

29. And he said to her, For this answer go your way; the devil has gone out of your daughter.

30. And when she came to her house, she found the devil gone, and her daughter lying upon the bed.

31. And again, departing from the region of Tyre, through Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the region of Decapolis.

32. And they brought to him one who was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to put his hand upon him.

33. And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

34. And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

35. And immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.

36. And he commanded them that they should tell no man: but the more he commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it;

37. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

## Mark 8

1. In those days another great multitude gathered, and as they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,

2. I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

3. And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint on the way: for some of them came from afar.

4. And his disciples answered him, Where can a man find enough bread to satisfy these men here in the wilderness?

5. And he asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.

6. And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the people.

7. And they had a few small fish: which he blessed, and commanded to be set before them as well.

8. So they ate, and were filled: and of the broken pieces that were left over they picked up seven baskets.

9. And there were about four thousand people: and he sent them away.

10. And immediately he entered into a boat with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanutha.

11. And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, testing him.

12. And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek after a sign? truly I say to you, There shall be no sign given to this generation.

13. And he left them, and entering into the boat again departed to the other side.

14. Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and did not have in the boat with them more than one loaf.

15. And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.

16. And they discussed among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.

17. And being aware of this, Jesus said to them, Why do you discuss having no bread? do you not yet see or understand? are your hearts hardened?

18. Having eyes, do you not see? and having ears, do you not hear? and do you not remember?

19. When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you pick up? They said to him, Twelve.

20. And when I broke the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you pick up? And they said, Seven.

21. And he said to them, How is it that you do not understand?

22. And he came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.

23. And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw anything.

24. And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

25. After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw everything clearly.

26. And he sent him away to his house, saying, Do not go into the village.

27. And Jesus went out, with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?

28. And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.

29. And he said to them, But who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said to him, You are the Christ.

30. And he commanded them that they should tell no man about him.

31. And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and by the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

32. And he spoke this plainly. And Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him.

33. But when he had turned about and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind me, Satan: for you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things that are of men.

34. And when he had called the people to him, with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

35. For whoever would save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, shall save it.

36. For what does it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

37. Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

38. Therefore, whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

## Mark 9

1. And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there are some of those who stand here, who shall not taste of death, until they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

2. And after six days Jesus took with him Peter, and James, and John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.

3. And his clothing became shining and exceedingly white; as no fuller on earth could whiten them.

4. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.

5. And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

6. For he did not know what to say; for they were very afraid.

7. And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

8. And suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no man with them, except Jesus only.

9. And as they came down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no man the things they had seen, until the Son of man should have risen from the dead.

10. And they kept that saying to themselves, questioning one with another what rising from the dead might mean.

11. And they asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

12. And he answered them, Elijah truly comes first, and restores all things; and how is it written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be treated with contempt?

13. But I say to you, That Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.

14. And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes arguing with them.

15. And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and ran to greet him.

16. And he asked the scribes, What are you discussing with them?

17. And one of the multitude answered and said, Teacher, I have brought to you my son, who has a dumb spirit;

18. And whenever it seizes him, it tears him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid: and I asked your disciples to cast it out; and they could not.

19. He answered him, and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you? bring him to me.

20. And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground, and rolled around foaming at the mouth.

21. And he asked his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, Since he was a child.

22. And often it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.

23. Jesus said to him, If you can! all things are possible to him who believes.

24. And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said, Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief.

25. When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and do not enter into him again.

26. And the spirit cried out, and threw him into severe convulsions, and came out of him: and he was like a corpse; so that many said, He is dead.

27. But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.

28. And when he came into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could we not cast it out?

29. And he said to them, This kind can come out by nothing but prayer.

30. And they departed from there, and passed through Galilee; and he would not have any man know about it,

31. For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after he is killed, he shall rise on the third day.

32. But they did not understood that saying, and were afraid to ask him.

33. And he came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were you discussing among yourselves along the way?

34. But they kept quiet: for along the way they had discussed which of them was the greatest.

35. And he sat down, and called the twelve, and said to them, If any man desires to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.

36. And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them,

37. Whoever shall receive one child such as this in my name, receives me: and whoever shall receive me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.

38. And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw someone casting out devils in your name, and we forbad him, because he does not follow us.

39. But Jesus said, Do not forbid him: for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name, who can soon after speak evil of me.

40. For he who is not against us is for us.

41. For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.

42. And whoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

43. And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched:

44. [Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]

45. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off: it is better for you to enter life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched:

46. [Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]

47. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell:

48. Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.

49. For everyone shall be salted with fire.

50. Salt is good: but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace with one another.

## Mark 10

1. And he arose from there, and went into the region of Judaea on the farther side of the Jordan: and the people came to him again; and, as was his custom, he taught them.

2. And the Pharisees came to him, and tested him, asking, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?

3. And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?

4. And they said, Moses allowed a man to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.

5. Jesus answered and said to them, Because of the hardness of your hearts he wrote you this commandment.

6. But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.

7. For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife;

8. And the two shall be one flesh: so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.

9. Therefore, what God has joined together, let man not separate.

10. And in the house his disciples asked him again about the matter.

11. And he said to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery against her.

12. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.

13. And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those who brought them.

14. But when Jesus saw it, he was very displeased, and said to them, Let the little children come to me, and do not forbid them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God.

15. Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter it at all.

16. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

17. And when he started forth on his way, a man came running to him, and kneeled before him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

18. And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? there is no one good but God alone.

19. You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour your father and mother.

20. And he answered and said to him, Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.

21. Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come follow me.

22. And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great wealth.

23. And Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!

24. And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answered again, and said to them, Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!

25. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.

26. And they were astonished beyond measure, and said among themselves, Who then can be saved?

27. And Jesus looking upon them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

28. Then Peter said to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed you.

29. And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,

30. Who shall not receive a hundredfold in this present time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

31. But many who are first shall be last; and the last first.

32. And they were on the way up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And again he took the twelve aside, and began to tell them the things that would happen to him,

33. Saying, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:

34. And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.

35. And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him, saying, Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.

36. And he said to them, What do you want me to do for you?

37. They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.

38. But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking: can you drink of the cup that I drink? or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?

39. And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink; and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized:

40. But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared.

41. And when the ten heard it, they began to be very displeased with James and John.

42. But Jesus called them to him, and said to them, You know that those who are regarded as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.

43. But it shall not be so among you: but whoever wishes to be great among you, shall be your servant:

44. And whoever wants to be the first among you, shall be the slave of all.

45. For even the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.

46. And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway begging.

47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.

48. And many commanded him to hold his peace: but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.

49. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying to him, Take courage, arise; he calls you.

50. And he cast away his cloak, arose, and came to Jesus.

51. And Jesus said to him, What do you want that I should do for you? The blind man said to him, Master, I want to receive my sight.

52. And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you well. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus along the way.

## Mark 11

1. And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sent forth two of his disciples,

2. And said to them, Go into the village opposite you: as soon as you enter it, you shall find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.

3. And if any man says to you, What are you doing? say that the Lord has need of it; and will send it back immediately.

4. And they went their way, and found the colt tied outside in the street by a door; and they untied it.

5. And some of those who stood there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt?

6. And they said to them what Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.

7. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it.

8. And many spread their garments on the road: and others spread branches they had cut in the fields.

9. And those who went ahead, and those who followed, cried out, Hosanna; Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord:

10. Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.

11. And Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple: and when he looked around at everything, he went out to Bethany with the twelve, since evening had come.

12. On the next day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry:

13. And seeing a fig tree far off with leaves, he went to it, to see if he might find something on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season for figs.

14. And Jesus said to it, May no man ever eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard it.

15. And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold doves;

16. And he would not allow any man to carry merchandise through the temple.

17. And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations? but you have made it a den of robbers.

18. And the scribes and chief priests heard this, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his teaching.

19. And when evening came, he went out of the city.

20. And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.

21. And Peter remembered and said to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which you cursed has withered away.

22. And Jesus said to them, Have faith in God.

23. For truly I say to you, That whoever shall say to this mountain, Be removed, and be cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he says.

24. Therefore I say to you, Whatever things you desire, when you pray, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.

25. And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone: that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive your trespasses.

26. [But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.]

27. And they came again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,

28. And said to him, By what authority do you do these things? and who gave you this authority to do these things?

29. And Jesus answered them, I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

30. The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.

31. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?

32. But if we shall say, From men; they feared the people: for all held that John was indeed a prophet.

33. So they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.

## Mark 12

1. And he began to speak to them in parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a place for the winepress, and built a tower, and rented it out to farmers, and went to a far country.

2. And at harvest time he sent a servant to the farmers, that he might receive from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.

3. But they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.

4. And he sent to them another servant; and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.

5. And he sent another; but they killed him, and so they did to many others; beating some, and killing some.

6. Having yet one more to send, his well-beloved son, he sent him last of all to them, saying, They will respect my son.

7. But the farmers said to themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.

8. And they took him, and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.

9. Therefore, what shall the owner of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.

10. Have you not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone:

11. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

12. And they sought to lay hold of him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.

13. And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to catch him in his words.

14. And when they had come, they said to him, Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and defer to no man: for you do not regard the position of men, but teach the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?

15. Shall we pay, or shall we not pay? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why are you testing me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it.

16. And they brought it. And he said to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.

17. And Jesus answered, saying to them, Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.

18. Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him, and they questioned him, saying,

19. Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If a man's brother dies, and leaves his wife, but leaves no child, his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.

20. Now there were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died, leaving no child.

21. And the second took her, and died without leaving a child: and the third likewise.

22. All seven had her, and left no child: last of all the woman died also.

23. Therefore, in the resurrection, when they shall rise, which one's wife shall she be? for all seven had her as wife.

24. Jesus answered them, Is this not the reason you err, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?

25. For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are like the angels in heaven.

26. And as for the dead rising: have you not read in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him in the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

27. He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: therefore you are greatly mistaken.

28. And one of the scribes came, and having heard them arguing, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?

29. And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

30. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.

31. And the second is this, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.

32. And the scribe said to him, Well said, Teacher, you have spoken the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

33. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbour as oneself, is more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.

34. And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no man dared ask him anything.

35. And while he taught in the temple, Jesus said, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?

36. For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.

37. Therefore, David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son? And the great crowd heard him gladly.

38. And in his teaching he said to them, Beware of the scribes, who love to go about in long clothing, and love greetings in the marketplaces,

39. And the chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honour at feasts:

40. They devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.

41. And Jesus sat across from the treasury, and watched how the people put money into the treasury: and many who were rich cast in much.

42. And a certain poor widow came, and she put in two small copper coins, which make a farthing.

43. And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, Truly I say to you, That this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others:

44. For all the others gave out of their abundance; but she gave out of her poverty, putting in everything she had, all she had to live on.

## Mark 13

1. And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, see what wonderful stones and buildings!

2. Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? there shall not be one stone left upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

3. And as he sat upon the mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,

4. Tell us, when shall these things be? and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be fulfilled?

5. And Jesus said to them, Take heed lest any man deceive you:

6. For many will come in my name, saying, I am he; and shall deceive many.

7. And when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be troubled: for such things must happen; but the end is not yet.

8. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in various places, and there shall be famines: these are the beginnings of birth pains.

9. But take heed for yourselves: for they will deliver you up to councils; and you shall be beaten in the synagogues: and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them.

10. And the gospel must first be preached among all nations.

11. But when they bring you to trial, do not worry about what you shall say: but whatever is given to you in that hour, speak that: for it is not you who speaks, but the Holy Spirit.

12. Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.

13. And you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake: but he who endures to the end shall be saved.

14. When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be, (let him who reads understand,) then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains:

15. And let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter it to take anything out of his house:

16. And let him who is in the field not turn back again for his cloak.

17. But woe to those who are with child, and to those who are nursing infants in those days!

18. Pray that your flight may not be in the winter.

19. For in those days there shall be affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of God's creation to this time, nor ever shall be again.

20. And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no one would be saved: but for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.

21. And then if any man says to you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, lo, there he is; do not believe him:

22. For false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.

23. But take heed: behold, I have told you all things in advance.

24. But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

25. And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.

26. And then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.

27. And then he shall send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the remotest part of the earth to the remotest part of heaven.

28. Now learn a parable from the fig tree; When its branch becomes tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:

29. Even so, when you see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the door.

30. Truly I say to you, that this generation shall not pass away, until all these things have happened.

31. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

32. But of that day and that hour no man knows, no, not even the angels which are in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

33. Take heed, watch and pray: for you do not know when the time will come.

34. It is like a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to each man his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.

35. Watch therefore: for you do not know when the master of the house comes, at evening, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:

36. Lest he come suddenly and find you sleeping.

37. And what I say to you I say to all, Watch.

## Mark 14

1. After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him secretly, and put him to death.

2. But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.

3. And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he reclined at table, there came a woman having an alabaster vial of perfume of pure nard; and she broke the vial, and poured it on his head.

4. And some were indignant, and said to themselves, Why was this perfume wasted?

5. For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and have been given to the poor. And they reproved her.

6. And Jesus said, Let her alone; why are you troubling her? she has done a beautiful thing to me.

7. For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you wish you may do them good: but you will not always have me.

8. She has done what she could: she has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.

9. Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, what she has done shall be spoken of in remembrance of her.

10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.

11. And when they heard this, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.

12. On the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover lamb, his disciples said to him, Where do you want us to go and prepare the passover for you to eat?

13. And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the city, and there you shall meet a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him.

14. And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

15. And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready: make preparations for us there.

16. And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found it as he had said to them: and they made the passover ready.

17. And in the evening he came with the twelve.

18. And as they sat and ate, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you who eats with me shall betray me.

19. And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I?

20. And he answered them, It is one of the twelve, one who dips with me in the bowl.

21. The Son of man shall indeed go, just as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it would be better for that man if he had never been born.

22. And as they ate, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take it: this is my body.

23. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank from it.

24. And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many.

25. Truly I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.

26. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.

27. And Jesus said to them, All you shall fall away because of me: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.

28. But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

29. But Peter said to him, Although all shall fall away, I will not.

30. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this day, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you shall deny me three times.

31. But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with you, I will not deny you. And they all said the same.

32. And they came to a place named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit here, while I pray.

33. And he took with him Peter and James and John, and he began to be filled with horror and deeply troubled;

34. And he said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, to the point of death: stay here, and watch.

35. And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.

36. And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible for you; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will.

37. And he came, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? could you not watch for one hour?

38. Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

39. And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words.

40. And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they did not know what to answer him.

41. And he came the third time, and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? enough, the hour has come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

42. Rise up, let us go; behold, he who betrays me is at hand.

43. And immediately, while he yet spoke, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

44. And he who betrayed him had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I kiss is the one; take him, and lead him away safely.

45. And as soon as he came, he went immediately to him, and said, Master; and kissed him.

46. And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

47. And one of those who stood nearby drew a sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

48. And Jesus said to them, Have you come out, as against a thief, with swords and clubs to take me?

49. I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

50. And they all forsook him, and fled.

51. And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth wrapped around his naked body; and they laid hold on him:

52. But he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

53. And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.

54. And Peter followed him from afar, even into the courtyard of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.

55. And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but found none.

56. For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree.

57. And some arose, and bore false witness against him, saying,

58. We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.

59. But even then their testimonies did not agree.

60. And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, Have you no answer? what is it that these men are testifying against you?

61. But he held his peace, and said nothing. Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?

62. And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

63. Then the high priest tore his clothes, and said, Why do we need any further witnesses?

64. You have heard the blasphemy: what do you think? And they all condemned him as worthy of death.

65. And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and as the guards took him they beat him with their fists.

66. And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came:

67. And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, You also were with Jesus of Nazareth.

68. But he denied it, saying, I do not know or understand what you are saying. And he went out into the entryway.

69. And the maid saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, This is one of them.

70. And he denied it again. And a little later, those who stood nearby again said to Peter, Surely you are one of them: for you are also a Galilaean.

71. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know this man of whom you speak.

72. And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter remembered that Jesus said to him, Before the cock crows twice, you shall deny me three times. And when he remembered this, he wept.

## Mark 15

1. And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

2. And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he said to him, You say so.

3. And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.

4. And Pilate asked him again, saying, Have you no answer to make? behold how many things they testify against you.

5. But Jesus made no further answer; so that Pilate was amazed.

6. Now at the feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they requested.

7. And there was one named Barabbas, who was in prison with his fellow rebels, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

8. And the multitude approached and began asking him to do for them as he usually did.

9. Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?

10. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him out of envy.

11. But the chief priests incited the people to have him release Barabbas to them.

12. And Pilate answered and said again to them, What then shall I do with him whom you call the King of the Jews?

13. And they cried out again, Crucify him.

14. Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out all the louder, Crucify him.

15. And so Pilate, wanting to satisfy the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.

16. And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called the Praetorium; and they called together the whole band of soldiers.

17. And they clothed him with purple, and weaved a crown of thorns, and put it on him,

18. And began to acclaim him, Hail, King of the Jews!

19. And they struck him on the head with a cane, and spat upon him, and bowed their knees in worship to him.

20. And when they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

21. And they compelled Simon, a Cyrenian who was passing by on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

22. And they brought him to the place called Golgotha, which means, The place of a skull.

23. And they gave him wine to drink mingled with myrrh: but he would not take it.

24. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots for them, to decide what each man should take.

25. And it was the third hour when they crucified him.

26. And the inscription of the accusation against him was written above him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27. And with him they crucified two thieves; one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

28. [And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors.]

29. And those who passed by kept abusing him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you who would destroy the temple, and build it in three days,

30. Save yourself, and come down from the cross.

31. Likewise, the chief priests mocked him among themselves and with the scribes, He saved others; but he cannot save himself.

32. Let Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And those who were crucified with him also reviled him.

33. And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which means, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

35. And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he is calling Elijah.

36. And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Wait; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.

37. And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed his last.

38. And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.

39. And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw how he breathed his last, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

40. There were also women looking on from afar: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

41. (Who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.

42. And when the evening had come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the sabbath,

43. Joseph of Arimathaea, an honoured member of the council, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.

44. And Pilate wondered if he was dead so soon: and calling the centurion, he asked him if he was already dead.

45. And when he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.

46. So he bought a fine linen cloth, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a tomb which was cut out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.

47. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses watched where he was laid.

## Mark 16

1. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that they might go and anoint him.

2. And very early in the morning of the first day of the week, they came to the tomb at the rising of the sun.

3. And they said to one another, Who shall roll the stone away from the door of the tomb for us?

4. And when they looked, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled away.

5. And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were amazed.

6. And he said to them, Do not be afraid: You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he has risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.

7. But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there you shall see him, as he told you.

8. And they went out quickly, and fled from the tomb; for they were trembling and amazed: and they said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid. MR 16:9[ Now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

9. And she went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.

10. And they, when they heard that he was alive, and that she had seen him, did not believe.

11. After that he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.

12. And they went and told it to the others, who also did not believe them.

13. Afterward, he appeared to the eleven as they sat eating, and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he had risen.

14. And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

15. He who believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he who does not believe shall be condemned.

16. And these signs shall follow those who believe; In my name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

17. They shall pick up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

18. So after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

19. And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with accompanying signs.]
