# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent his angel to make it known to his servant John:

2. Who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw.

3. Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and heed those things which are written in it: for the time is at hand.

4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;

5. And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, and the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and freed us from our sins by his own blood,

6. And has made us a kingdom, and priests to his God and Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

7. Behold, he comes with the clouds; and every eye shall see him, even those who pierced him: and all families of the earth shall mourn because of him. Even so, Amen.

8. I am Alpha and Omega, says the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.

9. I, John, your brother and companion in the tribulation, and kingdom, and endurance which are ours in Jesus, was on the island that is called Patmos, because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.

10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,

11. Saying, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands;

13. And in the midst of the seven lampstands, one like a Son of man, clothed with a garment down to his feet, and around his breast a golden girdle.

14. His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were like a flame of fire;

15. And his feet like burnished bronze, as if they glowed in a furnace; and his voice like the sound of many waters.

16. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword: and his face was like the sun shining at full strength.

17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as if dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying to me, Do not fear; I am the first and the last,

18. The one who lives; I was dead, and, behold, I am alive forevermore, and possess the keys of death and of Hades.

19. Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

20. The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands, is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands;

2. I know your works, and your labour, and your patience, and how you cannot bear those who are evil, and how you have tested those who say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them to be liars;

3. And how you have persevered, and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown weary.

4. Yet I have this against you, that you have left your first love.

5. Remember the height from which you have fallen, and repent, and do the works you did at first; or else I will come to you, and will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.

6. But this you have in your favour, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To him who overcomes I will give the right to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.

8. And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These are the words of him who is the first and the last, who was dead, and came to life;

9. I know your tribulation and your poverty, (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

10. Do not fear any of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.

11. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.

12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write; These are the words of him who has the sharp sword with two edges;

13. I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is: and that you hold fast to my name, and have not denied my faith, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.

14. But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, that they might eat things sacrificed to idols, and commit sexual immorality.

15. In the same way you also have those who hold to the teachings of the Nicolaitans.

16. Therefore repent; or else I will come to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

17. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no man knows except him who receives it.

18. And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bonze;

19. I know your works, and your love, and faith, and service, and perseverance, and that your recent works are greater than those you did at first.

20. Nevertheless, I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and beguiles my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.

21. And I gave her time to repent; but she refuses to repent of her immorality.

22. Behold, I will cast her upon a bed of anguish, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.

23. And I will strike her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searches minds and hearts: and I will give to every one of you as your deeds deserve.

24. But I say to you, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not hold to this teaching, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they call them; I will put upon you no other burden;

25. Only that you hold fast to what you have, until I come.

26. And he who overcomes, and does my will to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;

27. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as when the vessels of a potter are broken to pieces: just as I received authority from my Father.

28. And I will give him the morning star.

29. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

## Revelation 3

1. And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These are the words of him who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.

2. Awake, and strengthen those things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of God.

3. Therefore, remember what you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If you will not awaken, I will come like a thief, and you shall not know at what hour I will come upon you.

4. Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.

5. He who overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white garments; and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

6. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

7. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These are the words of he who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;

8. I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: I know you have but little strength, yet you have kept my word, and have not denied my name.

9. Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will make them to come and bow down before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.

10. Because you have kept my word to patiently endure, I will keep you from the hour of trial, which shall come upon all the world, to test those who live upon the earth.

11. Behold, I come quickly: hold fast to that which you have, that no man may take your crown.

12. He who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall never go out of it: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will also write upon him my new name.

13. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

14. And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;

15. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I wish that you were either cold or hot.

16. So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth.

17. For you say, I am rich, and have grown wealthy, and have need of nothing; but you do not know that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

18. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white clothing, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness may not appear; and salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.

19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: therefore be zealous, and repent.

20. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will eat with him, and he with me.

21. To him who overcomes I will grant the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.

22. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

## Revelation 4

1. After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.

2. And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and one sat on the throne.

3. And he who sat there appeared like jasper and carnelian: and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.

4. And surrounding the throne were twenty-four thrones: and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments; and upon their heads they had crowns of gold.

5. And out of the throne came flashes of lightning and peals of thunder: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

6. And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal: and in the center, around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.

7. And the first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.

8. And the four living creatures each had six wings, covered with eyes around and within: and day and night they never stop saying, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.

9. And when those living creatures give glory and honour and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,

10. The twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

11. You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for you have created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll, with writing inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to break its seals?

3. And no man in heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, was able to open the scroll, or to look into it.

4. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the scroll, or to look into it.

5. Then one of the elders said to me, Do not weep: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so he can open the scroll and its seven seals.

6. And then I beheld between the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as if it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

7. And he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of him who sat upon the throne.

8. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb; each one had a harp, and they had golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the scroll, and to break its seals: for you were slain, and by your blood have purchased men for God out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;

10. And have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God: and they shall reign upon the earth.

11. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands upon thousands;

12. Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.

13. And I heard every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be to him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.

14. And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped .

## Revelation 6

1. Then I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, Come.

2. And I saw, and behold, a white horse: and he who sat upon it had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

3. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come.

4. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him who sat upon it to take peace from the earth, that men should slay one another: and there was given to him a great sword.

5. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come. And I beheld, and lo, a black horse; and he who sat upon it had a pair of scales in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not hurt the oil and the wine.

7. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come.

8. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse: and the name of him who sat upon it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with plague, and with the wild beasts of the earth.

9. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they maintained:

10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, must it be before you judge those who live on the earth, and avenge our blood?

11. And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, should be completed.

12. And I beheld, and, lo, when he had opened the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;

13. And the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts down its unripe figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind.

14. And the sky vanished, as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.

15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;

16. And they called to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:

17. For the great day of his wrath has come; and who shall be able to stand?

## Revelation 7

1. And after these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

2. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom had been given power to hurt the earth and the sea,

3. Saying, Do not hurt the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of those who were sealed: and there were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand from all the tribes of the sons of Israel.

5. From the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.

6. From the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand.

7. From the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.

8. From the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. From the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

9. After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, from all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands;

10. And cried out with a loud voice, saying, Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb.

11. And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,

12. Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.

13. And one of the elders addressed me, saying, Who are these who are arrayed in white robes? and from where did they come?

14. And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

15. Therefore, they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he who sits on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.

16. They shall hunger no more, nor shall they thirst any more; nor shall the sun beat upon them, nor shall any scorching heat.

17. For the Lamb who is at the center of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall lead them to the springs of the waters of life: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

## Revelation 8

1. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels who stand before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.

3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God out of the angel's hand.

5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there were rumblings, and peals of thunder, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.

6. And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.

7. The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.

8. And the second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and a third of the sea became blood;

9. And a third of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.

10. And the third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning as if it were a torch, and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the springs of waters;

11. And the name of the star is Wormwood: and a third of the waters became wormwood; and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.

12. And the fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun was smitten, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars; so that a third of them was darkened, and a third of the day the light did not shine, and likewise a third of the night.

13. And I beheld, and heard an eagle flying through mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the blasts of the trumpets by the other three angels, which are about to sound!

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key to the bottomless pit.

2. And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose smoke out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.

3. And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.

4. And they were told not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.

5. And they were not permitted to kill them, but only to torment them for five months: and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when he stings a man.

6. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

7. And the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.

8. And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.

9. And they had breastplates, like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots and horses rushing to battle.

10. And they had tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails they had the power to hurt men for five months.

11. And they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue, Apollyon.

12. One woe is past; behold, there are two more woes yet to come.

13. And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,

14. Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four angels were released, who had been prepared for this hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill a third of mankind.

16. And the number of the armies of the horsemen were two hundred million: I heard the number of them.

17. And in the vision, this was how I saw the horses and those who sat upon them: they wore breastplates of fiery red, sapphire blue, and sulphur yellow: and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur.

18. By these three was a third of mankind killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the sulphur, which came out of their mouths.

19. For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails: for their tails were like serpents, and had heads, and with them they do harm.

20. And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, still did not repent of the works of their hands; they did not stop worshipping devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and wood: which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:

21. Nor did they repent of their murders, or of their sorceries, or of their sexual immorality, or of their thefts.

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.

2. And he had open in his hand a little scroll: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth,

3. And he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried out, the voices of seven thunders spoke.

4. And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them.

5. And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven,

6. And swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are in it, and the earth, and the things that are in it, and the sea, and the things that are in it, that there should be no more delay:

7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.

8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go and take the little scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth.

9. And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little scroll. And he said to me, Take, and eat it; it shall make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it shall be sweet as honey.

10. And I took the little scroll out of the angel's hand, and ate it; and in my mouth it was sweet as honey: but as soon as I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.

11. And he said to me, You must prophesy again about many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

## Revelation 11

1. And there was given to me a reed like a measuring rod: and I was told, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship there.

2. But the court which is outside the temple leave out, and do not measure it; for it is given to the Gentiles: and they shall tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.

3. And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy for a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands standing before the Lord of the earth.

5. And if any man wants to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouths, and devours their enemies: and if any man wants to harm them, he must in this manner be killed.

6. These two have power to shut up the sky, so that it does not rain during the days of their prophesying: and have power over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all manner of plagues, as often as they desire.

7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.

8. And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which figuratively is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.

9. For three days and a half, men from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies, and shall not allow their dead bodies to be put in a tomb.

10. And those who live upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts to one another; because these two prophets tormented those who dwell upon the earth.

11. And after three days and a half the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them.

12. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.

13. And that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain seven thousand men: and the remnant were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14. The second woe is past; behold, the third woe comes quickly.

15. And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever.

16. And the twenty-four elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,

17. Saying, We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who are, and were; because you have taken your great power, and have begun to reign.

18. The nations raged, and your wrath came; and the time came for the dead to be judged, and to reward your servants the prophets, and the saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth.

19. Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant: and there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.

## Revelation 12

1. And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

2. And she was with child, and in the pains of birth cried out to be delivered.

3. And there appeared another sign in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

4. And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was born.

5. And she brought forth a male child, who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she might be sustained for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.

7. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,

8. But were not strong enough; and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.

9. And the great dragon was cast down, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world: he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.

10. And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have come: for the accuser of our brethren has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.

11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they did not love their lives to death.

12. Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you who live in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.

13. And when the dragon saw that he had been cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the male child.

14. And to the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, to her place, where she would be sustained for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent spewed out of his mouth water like a river after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.

16. And the earth helped the woman, and the ground opened its mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.

17. And the dragon was furious with the woman, and went to make war against the rest of her descendants, those who keep the commandments of God, and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

## Revelation 13

1. And I saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon each head a name of blasphemy.

2. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.

3. And one of his heads seemed to have had a death-blow; but his deadly wound was healed: and all the world was astonished and followed after the beast.

4. And they worshipped the dragon, because he gave authority to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? who is able to make war against him?

5. And there was given to him a mouth speaking proud words and blasphemies; and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months.

6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, and those who live in heaven.

7. And it was given to him to make war on the saints, and to overcome them: and authority was given to him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.

8. And all who live upon the earth shall worship him, every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world.

9. If any man has an ear, let him hear.

10. He who is to go into captivity shall go into captivity: he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.

11. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.

12. And he exercises all the power of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who live in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

13. And he performs great wonders, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven to the earth in the sight of men,

14. And deceives those who live on the earth by the miracles which he had the power to do in the sight of the beast; bidding those who live on the earth to make an image in honour of the beast, who was wounded by the sword, and yet lived.

15. And he had power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.

16. And he causes everyone, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand, or on his forehead:

17. And no man might buy or sell, unless he had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

18. This calls for wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.

## Revelation 14

1. And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the roar of great thunder: the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing upon their harps:

3. And they sang a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who had been redeemed from the earth.

4. These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women; for they are chaste. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed from among men, as first-fruits to God and to the Lamb.

5. And no lie was found in their mouths: for they are without fault.

6. And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,

7. Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment has come: and worship him who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the springs of water.

8. And there followed another angel, saying, Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great, she who made all the nations drink of the maddening wine of her adulteries.

9. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead, or on his hand,

10. He shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out at full strength into the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

11. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever: and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, or who receive the mark of his name.

12. Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth: Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow them.

14. And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud sat one like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time has come to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

16. And he who sat upon the cloud swung his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has power over fire; and cried out with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

19. And the angel swung his sickle upon the earth, and gathered the grapes from the vine of the earth, and cast them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

20. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, as high as the horses' bridles, for a distance of a thousand and six hundred stadia.

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for with them the wrath of God is completed.

2. And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mingled with fire: and those who had won the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding the harps of God.

3. And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, O King of the ages.

4. Who shall not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? for you alone are holy: all nations shall come and worship before you; for your righteous acts have been revealed.

5. And after that I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened:

6. And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.

7. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.

8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth.

2. And the first went, and poured out his bowl upon the earth; and foul and malignant sores fell upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and upon those who worshipped his image.

3. And the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became like the blood of a dead man: and every living thing in the sea died.

4. And the third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and springs of water; and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, you who are, and were, O Holy One, because you have judged thus.

6. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; for such is their due.

7. And I heard the altar say, Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.

8. And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given power to scorch men with fire.

9. And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, who has power over these plagues: and they did not repent and give him glory.

10. And the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was filled with darkness; and they gnawed their tongues in pain,

11. And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds.

12. And the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way for the kings of the east might be prepared.

13. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

14. For they are the spirits of devils, working miraculous signs, who go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for battle on the great day of God Almighty.

15. Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who stays awake, and keeps his garments with him, lest he walk naked and ashamed for all to see.

16. And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon.

17. And the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done.

18. And there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as had never been since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake it was, and so great.

19. And the great city was broken into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and God remembered Babylon the great, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.

20. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

21. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of hail; for the plague was exceedingly great.

## Revelation 17

1. Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, came and spoke to me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon many waters.

2. With her the kings of the earth have committed acts of adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her adulteries.

3. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, which was full of names of blasphemy, and had seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and of the filthiness of her adulteries:

5. And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered greatly.

7. And the angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.

8. The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go to perdition: and those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, shall marvel when they behold the beast, because he was, and is not, and is to come.

9. This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.

10. And there are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain for a short time.

11. And the beast that was, and is not, is the eighth; and yet is one of the seven, and he goes to perdition.

12. And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but receive authority as kings for one hour, along with the beast.

13. These are of one mind, and shall give their power and authority to the beast.

14. They shall make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and those who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

15. And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, they shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

17. For God has put in their hearts to accomplish his purpose, by agreeing to give their sovereignty to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

18. And the woman you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.

## Revelation 18

1. And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was illuminated by his glory.

2. And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. It has become the dwelling place of devils, and the haunt of every foul spirit, and a haunt of every unclean and loathsome bird.

3. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her adulteries, and the kings of the earth have committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich with her excessive luxuries.

4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you may not be partakers of her sins, and that you may not receive her plagues.

5. For her sins have piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.

6. Repay her as she has paid, and double, according to her works: in the cup which she has mixed for others, mix for her a double portion.

7. As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, give to her that measure of torment and grief: for she says in her heart, I sit as a queen, and am no widow, and shall never see sorrow.

8. Therefore her plagues shall come in one day, pestilence, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.

9. And the kings of the earth, who have committed adultery and lived luxuriously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning;

10. They shall stand far off in fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour your judgment has come.

11. And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buys their cargoes any more:

12. Cargoes of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all citron wood, and all articles of ivory, and all articles of precious wood, and of bronze, and iron, and marble,

13. And cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and myrrh, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and the souls of men.

14. And the fruits that your soul longed for have departed from you, and all the luxuries and splendour have vanished, never to be found again.

15. The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand far off in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,

16. And saying, Alas, alas, the great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!

17. For in one hour such great wealth has come to ruin. And every shipmaster, and all voyagers in ships, and sailors, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood far off,

18. And cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city was ever like this great city!

19. And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, by which all who had ships on the sea were made rich by her wealth! for in one hour she has been laid waste.

20. Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets; for God has judged her for what she did to you.

21. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, With such violence shall the great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall never be found again.

22. And the sound of harpists, and musicians, and of flute players, and trumpeters, shall never be heard in you again; and no craftsman, of whatever craft, shall be found in you any more; and the sound of a millstone shall never be heard in you again;

23. And the light of a lamp shall never shine in you again; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall never be heard in you again: your merchants were the great men of the earth; and by your sorceries all nations were deceived.

24. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all who have been slain upon the earth.

## Revelation 19

1. And after these things I heard the roar of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and power belong to our God:

2. For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her adulteries, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.

3. And again they said, Alleluia. Her smoke rises up forever and ever.

4. And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

5. And a voice came from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both small and great.

6. And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters, like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord our God omnipotent reigns.

7. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.

8. And it was granted to her to be clothed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.

9. And he said to me, Write, Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.

10. And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, Do not do that: I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren, who hold to the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he who sat upon it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.

12. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written upon him, that no man knew, but he himself.

13. And he was clothed with a robe dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.

14. And the armies of heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

15. And out of his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which he may strike the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of Almighty God.

16. And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come and gather yourselves together for the great supper of God;

18. That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of those who sit upon them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.

19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat upon the horse, and against his army.

20. And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed miraculous signs in his presence, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image. They were both cast alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur.

21. And the rest were slain with the sword that came out of the mouth of him who sat upon the horse: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

2. And he laid hold of the dragon, that old serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,

3. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and sealed it over him, that he should no longer deceive the nations, until the thousand years should be ended: and after that he must be released for a short time.

4. And I saw thrones, on which were seated those to whom judgment had been given: and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness for Jesus, and for the word of God, and who had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, nor had they received his mark upon their foreheads, or on their hands; and they lived again and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

5. But the rest of the dead did not come to life again until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.

6. Blessed and holy is he who takes part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him for a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years have expired, Satan shall be released from his prison,

8. And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for battle: the number of them is like the sand of the sea.

9. And they marched across the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

10. And the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

12. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged by those things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.

13. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it; and death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them: and they were judged, every man according to his deeds.

14. And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.

15. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away; and there was no more sea.

2. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard a great voice from the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall live among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.

4. And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, or sorrow, or crying, or pain: for the former things have passed away.

5. And he who sits upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are faithful and true.

6. And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him who is thirsty, without cost, from the spring of the water of life.

7. He who overcomes shall inherit all these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.

8. But the cowardly, and unbelieving, and the vile, and murderers, and the sexually immoral, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and sulphur: which is the second death.

9. And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.

10. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,

11. Having the glory of God: and her radiance was like a stone most precious, like a jasper, clear as crystal.

12. It had a great and high wall, and twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

13. On the east were three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he who spoke to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.

16. And the city was laid out in a square, its length equal to its breadth: and he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

17. And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to man's measurement, which the angel was using.

18. And the wall was made of jasper: and the city of pure gold, like clear glass.

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

20. The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate made of a single pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.

22. And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

23. And the city had no need of the sun, or the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God is its light, and the Lamb its lamp.

24. And the nations shall walk by its light: and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory into it.

25. And its gates shall never be shut by day: and there shall be no night there.

26. And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.

27. But nothing impure shall enter into it, nor shall any man who commits shameful acts, or who lies: but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,

2. Down the middle of the street of the city. And on either side of the river was the tree of life, which bore twelve kinds of fruits, and yielded its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

3. And there shall no longer be any curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

4. And they shall see his face; and his name shall be upon their foreheads.

5. And there shall be no night there; and they shall need no lamp, nor light from the sun; for the Lord God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

6. And he said to me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.

7. Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.

8. I, John, heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.

9. Then he said to me, Do not do that: I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book: worship God.

10. And he said to me, Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.

11. He who is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he who is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he who is holy, let him be holy still.

12. Behold, I am coming quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according to what he has done.

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

14. Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.

15. Outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and the sexually immoral, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

16. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to you to testify of these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star.

17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him who hears say, Come. And let him who is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life without cost.

18. For I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:

19. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part in the tree of life, and in the holy city, which are described in this book.

20. He who testifies to these things says, Surely I am coming quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.

21. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all. Amen.
