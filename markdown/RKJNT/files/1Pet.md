# 1 Peter

## 1 Peter 1

1. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

2. Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, and sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be multiplied to you.

3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by his abundant mercy has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

4. To an imperishable and undefiled inheritance, that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,

5. Who are guarded by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

6. In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a time you may have to suffer various trials:

7. That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold, which perishes, though it is tested by fire, might be found to result in praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

8. Though you have not seen him, you love him; and though you do not see him now, yet you believe in him and rejoice with inexpressible and glorious joy:

9. Receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

10. Of this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that should come to you enquired and searched diligently:

11. Seeking to find to whom and when the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when he testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.

12. It was revealed to them that they did not serve themselves, but you, in the things which have now been made known to you by those who preached the gospel to you through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; things into which angels desire to look.

13. Therefore gird up your minds, be sober, and fix your hope fully on the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

14. Live as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the lusts of your former ignorance:

15. But as he who has called you is holy, so be holy in all your conduct;

16. Because it is written, Be holy; for I am holy.

17. And if you address as Father the one who without partiality judges according to every man's work, then pass the time of your stay on earth in reverent fear:

18. For you know that you were not redeemed with perishable things, such as silver and gold, from the vain way of life you inherited from your fathers;

19. But with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish and without spot:

20. Who was chosen before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you,

21. Who through him believe in God, who raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

22. Since you have purified your souls by obeying the truth, so you have a sincere love of the brethren; love one another fervently from the heart.

23. You have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever.

24. For, All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls away,

25. But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was preached to you.

## 1 Peter 2

1. Therefore, laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and envy, and all kinds of slander,

2. As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow by it in your salvation:

3. Since you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.

4. Coming to him as to a living stone, rejected by men, but chosen by God, and precious,

5. You also, as living stones, are being built up into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

6. For this is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious: and he who believes in him shall not be put to shame.

7. Therefore, to you who believe, he is precious: but to those who disbelieve, the stone which the builders rejected has become the very cornerstone,

8. And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; they stumble at the word, being disobedient: as they were appointed to do.

9. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God; that you should declare the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.

10. In times past you were not a people, but now you are the people of God: once you had not obtained mercy, but now you have obtained mercy.

11. Dearly beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers, abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul.

12. Conduct yourselves righteously among the Gentiles: that, though they speak against you as evildoers, they may behold your good works and glorify God on the day of visitation.

13. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme authority;

14. Or to governors, as to those who are sent by him to punish evildoers, and to praise those who do well.

15. For this is the will of God, that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men:

16. Live as free men, not using your liberty as a cloak for evil, but live as the servants of God.

17. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

18. Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the perverse.

19. For this is commendable, if for the sake of conscience toward God, a man endures sorrow while suffering wrongfully.

20. For what credit is there, if, when you are beaten for your wrongs, you endure it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you endure it patiently, this is commendable before God.

21. For to this you were called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps.

22. He committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth;

23. And when he was reviled, he did not revile in return; and when he suffered, he did not threaten; but committed himself to him who judges righteously.

24. He himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we might die to sins and live to righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.

25. For you were like sheep going astray; but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.

## 1 Peter 3

1. Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands; so that, if any do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the behaviour of the wives;

2. When they behold your chaste and reverent behaviour.

3. Let your beauty not be in outward adornment; the plaiting of hair, the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel;

4. But let it be of the inner person of your heart, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.

5. For in this manner the holy women in days of old, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, and were submissive to their husbands.

6. Thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: and you are her daughters, if you do right, and do not give way to fear.

7. Likewise, you husbands, live with your wives considerately, giving honour to the woman as the weaker vessel, since you are heirs together of the grace of life. Do this that your prayers may not be hindered.

8. Finally, be of one mind, have sympathy for one another, love as brethren, be compassionate, be humble.

9. Do not return evil for evil, or insult for insult: but instead with blessing; knowing that you were called to this, that you should inherit a blessing.

10. For, He who would love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile:

11. Let him turn from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.

12. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.

13. And who will harm you if you are zealous followers of that which is good?

14. But even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled;

15. But set apart Christ as Lord in your hearts: and always be ready to give an answer to every man who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you; but do it with gentleness and respect,

16. Keeping a good conscience, so that when you are falsely accused, those who revile your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed.

17. For it is better, if it is the will of God, that you suffer for doing right, than for doing evil.

18. For Christ died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,

19. In which he went and preached to the spirits in prison,

20. Who long ago were disobedient, when God patiently waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was prepared, in which a few, that is, eight people, were saved through water.

21. This water symbolizes baptism, which now saves us (not by the removal of dirt from the body, but by an appeal of a good conscience to God,) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

22. Who has gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; with angels and authorities and powers made subject to him.

## 1 Peter 4

1. Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same mind: for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;

2. That he may live the rest of his time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.

3. For the time past was sufficient for doing the things the Gentiles desire to do: living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, revelling, carousing, and abominable idolatries.

4. They think it strange that you do not run with them into the same excess of dissipation, and they speak evil of you:

5. But they shall give an account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

6. For this reason the gospel was also preached to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh as men, they might live according to God in the spirit.

7. But the end of all things is at hand: therefore be of sound mind and sober judgement for prayer.

8. Above all things have fervent love for one another: for love covers a multitude of sins.

9. Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.

10. As every man has received a gift, so he should use it to serve one another, as befits good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

11. If any man speak, let it be as one who speaks the oracles of God; if any man serves, let him do it as by the strength which God supplies: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

12. Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial which comes upon you to test you, as though some strange thing was happened to you:

13. But rejoice, insofar as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be triumphantly joyful.

14. Blessed are you if you are insulted for the name of Christ; for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.

15. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a meddler in other men's affairs.

16. Yet if any man suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God that he bears that name.

17. For the time has come for judgment, which must begin with the household of God: and if it begins with us, what shall the end be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?

18. And if it is with difficulty that the righteous are saved, what shall become of the ungodly and the sinner?

19. Therefore, let those who suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to a faithful Creator by doing right.

## 1 Peter 5

1. I exhort the elders who are among you, as a fellow elder, and as a witness of the sufferings of Christ and as a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:

2. Tend the flock of God which is in your charge, not by compulsion, but willingly; not for sordid gain, but eagerly;

3. Not being lords over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.

4. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that does not fade away.

5. Likewise, you who are younger, submit yourselves to the elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another: for God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

6. Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:

7. Casting all your anxiety upon him; for he cares for you.

8. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone he may devour.

9. Resist him, steadfast in faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are required of your brethren who are throughout the world.

10. But the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.

11. To him be dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

12. Through Silvanus, a faithful brother, as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God; stand fast in it.

13. She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.

14. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ Jesus.
