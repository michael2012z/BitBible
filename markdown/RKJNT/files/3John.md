# 3 John

## 3 John 1

1. The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

2. Beloved, I pray that in all things you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.

3. For I rejoiced greatly, when some brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, how you walk in the truth.

4. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.

5. Beloved, you act faithfully whenever you perform any service for the brethren, especially when they are strangers.

6. For they have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you shall do well:

7. Because for his name's sake they went forth, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.

8. Therefore we ought to support such men, that we might be fellow workers in the truth.

9. I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept us.

10. Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds, prating against us with malicious words: and not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brethren, and forbids those who would, and casts them out of the church.

11. Beloved, do not follow that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God: but he who does evil has not seen God.

12. Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone, and by the truth itself: and we also bear witness; and you know that our testimony is true.

13. I had many things to write, but I prefer not to write with pen and ink:

14. But I hope I shall see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
