# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

2. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We ought always to thank God for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith grows abundantly, and the love of every one of you for each other grows greater;

4. So that we ourselves boast of you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all the persecutions and tribulations which you endure:

5. Which is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you suffer.

6. It is a righteous thing for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you;

7. And to give rest to you who are afflicted, along with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,

8. Taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. They shall be punished with eternal ruin and exclusion from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

10. When he shall come to be glorified in his saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all those who believe, including you, because our testimony among you was believed.

11. With this in mind we pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling, and would with power fulfill every good purpose and work of faith:

12. That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. Now, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brethren,

2. That you not be quickly shaken in mind, or alarmed, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter purporting to be from us, saying that the day of Christ is at hand.

3. Let no man deceive you in any way: for that day shall not come, until there is first a falling away, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition;

4. Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.

5. Do you not remember, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?

6. And you know what restrains him now, that he might be revealed in his time.

7. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work: only he who now restrains it will do so, until he is taken out of the way.

8. And then shall the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy by the brightness of his coming.

9. The coming of the lawless one is through the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders,

10. And with all wicked deception for those who perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

11. And for this reason God shall send them a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:

12. That all those might be condemned who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in unrighteousness.

13. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth:

14. To this he called you through our gospel, to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold to the traditions which you have been taught by us, whether by word, or by letter.

16. Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who has loved us, and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,

17. Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly, and be glorified, even as it did with you:

2. And that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men: for not all have faith.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.

4. And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we command.

5. May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the steadfastness of Christ.

6. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who is idle and does not walk according to the tradition which you received from us.

7. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we were not idle among you;

8. Nor did we eat any man's bread without paying; but with labour and toil we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you:

9. Not because we do not have the right, but to make ourselves an example for you to follow.

10. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: if any will not work, neither shall he eat.

11. For we hear that there are some among you who walk in idleness, not working at all, mere busybodies.

12. Now those who are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly, and eat their own bread.

13. But you, brethren, do not be weary in doing good.

14. And if any man will not obey our instruction in this letter, note that man, and do not associate with him, that he may be ashamed.

15. Yet do not count him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.

16. Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in all ways. The Lord be with you all.

17. I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is the mark of all my letters: this is the way I write.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
