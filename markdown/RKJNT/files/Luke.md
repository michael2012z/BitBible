# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Since many have undertaken to set forth in order a narrative of those things which have happened among us,

2. Just as they have been delivered to us, by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

3. It seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all these things from the very beginning, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,

4. That you might know the certainty of those things, about which you have been instructed.

5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abija: and his wife was one of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.

7. And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both now well along in years.

8. And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's service before God while his division was on duty,

9. According to the custom of the priest's office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.

10. And the whole multitude of people were praying outside at the time of incense offering.

11. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

12. And when Zechariah saw him, he was troubled, and fear came upon him.

13. But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zechariah: for your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.

14. And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.

15. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.

16. And he shall turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.

17. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

18. And Zechariah said to the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.

19. And the angel answered him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and have been sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.

20. Behold, you shall be silent, unable to speak, until the day that these things come to pass, because you have not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.

21. And the people waited for Zechariah, and wondered why he delayed so long in the temple.

22. And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.

23. And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his service were finished, he departed to his own house.

24. And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,

25. Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my disgrace among men.

26. And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

27. To a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

28. And the angel came to her, and said, Hail, you who are highly favoured, the Lord is with you.

29. And she was troubled at his words, and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.

30. And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favour with God.

31. And behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.

32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:

33. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

34. Then Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I am a virgin?

35. And the angel answered her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you: therefore the holy child to be born shall be called the Son of God.

36. And, behold, your cousin Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age: and she who was called barren is in her sixth month.

37. For with God nothing shall be impossible.

38. And Mary said, Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.

39. And at that time Mary arose, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;

40. And entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth.

41. And it came to pass, that, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:

42. And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

43. And why do I deserve to have the mother of my Lord come to me?

44. For, lo, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.

45. And blessed is she who believed that those things which were told her from the Lord would be fulfilled.

46. And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,

47. And my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour.

48. For he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

49. For he who is mighty has done great things for me; and holy is his name.

50. And his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation.

51. He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered those who were proud in the imagination of their hearts.

52. He has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the humble.

53. He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent away empty.

54. He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;

55. As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever.

56. And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.

57. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth; and she brought forth a son.

58. And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

59. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they were going to call him Zechariah, after the name of his father.

60. And his mother answered and said, No; he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her, There is no one of your family who is called by this name.

62. And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.

63. And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, His name is John. And they all marvelled.

64. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.

65. And fear came upon all who lived around them: and all these things were spoken of throughout all the hill country of Judaea.

66. And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What shall this child shall turn out to be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

68. Blessed is the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,

69. And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;

70. As he spoke by the mouths of his holy prophets, from long ago:

71. That we would be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;

72. To show the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;

73. The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,

74. That he would grant to us, that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,

75. In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our lives.

76. And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

77. To give to his people the knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness of their sins;

78. Through the tender mercy of our God, the sunrise from on high will visit us,

79. To give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

80. And the child grew, and grew strong in spirit, and lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

## Luke 2

1. And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.

2. (This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)

3. And all went to be registered, every one into his own city.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

5. To be registered with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child.

6. And so it was, that, while they were there, the time came for her to give birth.

7. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in strips of cloth, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

8. And in that same region there were shepherds in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

9. And, lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were very afraid.

10. And the angel said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which shall be for all people.

11. For to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.

12. And this shall be a sign to you; You shall find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,

14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men with whom he is pleased.

15. And it came to pass, as the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us go straight to Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.

16. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.

17. And when they had seen, they made known what was told them concerning this child.

18. And all those who heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told to them.

21. And when eight days had passed, when he was to be circumcised, he was given the name JESUS, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

22. And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were finished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;

23. (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

24. And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

25. And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and he was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

26. And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

27. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,

28. He took him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

29. Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word:

30. For my eyes have seen your salvation,

31. Which you have prepared in the presence of all people;

32. A light of revelation for the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.

33. And his father and mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.

34. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed to cause the fall and rising of many in Israel; and to be a sign which shall be spoken against;

35. (Yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

36. And there was Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;

37. And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fasting and prayer night and day.

38. And coming at that hour she also gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who looked for the redemption of Jerusalem.

39. And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

41. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.

42. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to the feast, according to the custom.

43. And after they had spent the full number of days, as they returned, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem; and his parents did not know.

44. But supposing him to have been in their company, they went a day's journey; then they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances.

45. And when they could not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.

46. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions.

47. And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.

48. And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us this way? behold, your father and I have sought you anxiously.

49. And he said to them, Why were you seeking me? did you not know that I must be about my Father's business?

50. And they did not understand what he said to them.

51. And he went down with them, to Nazareth, and was obedient to them: but his mother kept all these things in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,

2. When Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.

3. And he went into all the country about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins;

4. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

5. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

6. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

7. Then he said to the multitude that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bring forth fruit worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.

9. Even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees: every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.

10. And the people asked him, What shall we do then?

11. He answered and said to them, He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.

12. Then tax gatherers also came to be baptized, and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?

13. And he said to them, Collect no more than you have been ordered to.

14. And the soldiers likewise questioned him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not extort money from anyone or accuse anyone falsely; and be content with your wages.

15. And as the people were expectant, and wondering in their hearts if John was the Christ,

16. John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire:

17. Whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clear his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

18. And in his exhortation he preached many other things to the people.

19. But Herod the tetrarch, having been reproved by him because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and because of all the evils which Herod had done,

20. Added this to them all: he shut John up in prison.

21. Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also was baptized, and as he was praying, heaven was opened,

22. And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.

23. And Jesus was about thirty years of age when he began his work, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli,

24. The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,

25. The son of Mattathiah, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,

26. The son of Maath, the son of Mattathiah, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,

27. The son of Johanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,

28. The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,

29. The son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,

30. The son of Symeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,

31. The son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,

32. The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,

33. The son of Amminadab, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,

34. The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,

35. The son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,

36. The son of Cainan, the son of Arpachshad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,

37. The son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,

38. The son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

## Luke 4

1. And Jesus, being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness,

2. For forty days, while tempted by the devil. And during those days he ate nothing: and when they had ended, he was hungry.

3. And the devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.

4. And Jesus answered him, It is written, Man shall not live on bread alone.

5. And the devil, taking him up to a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And the devil said to him, I will give you all this power and its glory: for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I will.

7. Therefore if you will worship me, it shall all be yours.

8. Jesus answered him, It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.

9. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here:

10. For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you:

11. And in their hands they shall bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.

12. And Jesus answered and said to him, It is said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.

13. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee: and news about him went out to all the surrounding region.

15. And he taught in their synagogues, and was praised by all.

16. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as was his custom, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.

17. And there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,

19. To preach the year of the Lord's favour.

20. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the attendant, and sat down. And the eyes of all those who were in the synagogue were fastened upon him.

21. And he said to them, Today is this scripture fulfilled in your hearing.

22. And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is this not Joseph's son?

23. And he said to them, You will surely quote to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard you did in Capernaum, do here in your home town as well.

24. And he said, Truly I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own home town.

25. But I tell you a truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when there was great famine throughout all the land;

26. But Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Sarepta, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.

27. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, only Naaman the Syrian.

28. And all in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with anger,

29. And rose up, and drove him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might cast him down the cliff.

30. But he passed through the midst of them and went his way,

31. And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.

32. And they were astonished at his teaching: for his word was with power.

33. And in the synagogue there was a man, who had a spirit of an unclean devil, and he cried out with a loud voice,

34. Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are; the Holy One of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, without doing him any harm.

36. And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What word is this? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.

37. And his fame went out into every part of the surrounding country.

38. And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's house. And Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a burning fever; and they begged with him for her.

39. And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and served them.

40. Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.

41. And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God. And he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak: for they knew that he was the Christ.

42. And when it was day, he departed and went into a lonely place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and tried to keep him from leaving them.

43. But he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for I was sent for that purpose.

44. And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,

2. And saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gotten out of them, and were washing their nets.

3. And he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people from the boat.

4. Now when he finished speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.

5. And Simon answered him, Master, we have toiled all night, and have caught nothing: nevertheless at your word I will let down the net.

6. And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish: and their net began to break.

7. And they beckoned to their partners, who were in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.

8. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

9. For he was astonished, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken:

10. And so were James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now on you shall catch men.

11. And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.

12. And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, there came a man full of leprosy; who, seeing Jesus, fell on his face and begged him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.

13. And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And he ordered him to tell no man: But go, and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.

15. But his fame was spread abroad so much the more: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.

16. And he withdrew into the wilderness, and prayed.

17. And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting there, who had come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present for him to heal.

18. And, behold, men brought a man on a mat who was paralysed: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.

19. And when they could not find a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up on the roof, and let him down through the tiling with his mat into the midst of the crowd in front of Jesus.

20. And when he saw their faith, he said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven.

21. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?

22. But Jesus, aware of their thoughts, answered and said to them, Why do you question in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Rise up and walk?

24. But that you may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said to the paralytic,) I say to you, Arise, and take up your mat, and go to your house.

25. And immediately he rose up before them, and took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.

26. And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.

27. And after these things he went forth, and saw a tax gatherer, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, Follow me.

28. And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

29. And Levi made a great feast in his own house for him: and there was a great company of tax gatherers and of others who were reclining at table with them.

30. But the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax gatherers and sinners?

31. And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are well do not need a physician; but those who are sick.

32. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

33. And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but yours eat and drink?

34. And he said to them, Can you make the wedding guests fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.

36. And he also spoke a parable to them; No man puts a piece of a new garment upon an old garment; if he does, then the new garment is torn, and the piece that was taken out of the new garment does not match the old.

37. And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does the new wine will burst the skins, and be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.

38. But new wine must be put into new skins; then both are preserved.

39. And no man having drunk old wine desires the new: for he says, The old is better.

## Luke 6

1. And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the grain fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of grain, and ate them, rubbing them in their hands.

2. And some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the sabbath?

3. And Jesus answered and said to them, Have you not even read what David did, when he was hungry, he and those who were with him;

4. How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to those who were with him; although it is not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat of it?

5. And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.

6. And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, to see if he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find a reason to accuse him.

8. But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man with the withered hand, Rise up, and stand here. And he arose and stood there.

9. Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?

10. And looking around at them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored.

11. And they were filled with rage; and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.

12. And it came to pass in those days, that he went out to a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

13. And when it was day, he called his disciples: and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles;

14. Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot,

16. And Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

17. And he came down with them, and stood on a level place; and there was the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;

18. And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.

19. And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for power came from him, and healed them all.

20. And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are you who are poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

21. Blessed are you who hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now: for you shall laugh.

22. Blessed are you, when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and insult you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

23. Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward in heaven is great: for their fathers did the same to the prophets.

24. But woe to you who are rich! for you have received your comfort.

25. Woe to you who are full! for you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.

26. Woe to you, when all men speak well of you! for so their fathers did to the false prophets.

27. But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,

28. Bless those who curse you, and pray for those who abuse you.

29. And to him who strikes you on the cheek, offer him the other also; and from him who takes away your coat do not withhold your shirt either.

30. Give to every man who asks of you; and from him who takes away what is yours, do not ask for it back.

31. And as you would have men do to you, do the same to them.

32. For if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? for sinners also love those who love them.

33. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? for sinners also do the same.

34. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? for sinners also lend to sinners to receive repayment.

35. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Most High: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.

36. Be merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

37. Do not judge, and you shall not be judged: do not condemn, and you shall not be condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgiven:

38. Give, and it shall be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall men put in your lap. For the measure you give to others shall be the same measure given back to you.

39. And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

40. The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one who is fully trained shall be like his teacher.

41. And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?

42. Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the speck that is in your eye, when you do not even see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the speck that is in your brother's eye.

43. For a good tree does not bring forth bad fruit; nor does a bad tree bring forth good fruit.

44. For every tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorn bushes, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.

45. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for from the overflow of the heart his mouth speaks.

46. And why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and do not do the things which I say?

47. I will show you what he is like who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them:

48. He is like a man who built a house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the river beat violently upon that house, but could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.

49. But he who hears, and does not obey, is like a man who built a house upon the ground without a foundation; and the river beat violently against it, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

## Luke 7

1. Now when he finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.

2. And a certain centurion's slave, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.

3. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to him, begging him to come and heal his servant.

4. And when they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy to have you do this for him:

5. For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.

6. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble yourself: for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof:

7. Nor did I think myself worthy to come to you: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.

8. For I also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers; and I say to one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

9. When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said to the people who followed him, I say to you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.

10. And those who were sent, returned to the house, and found the slave well.

11. And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, as did many people.

12. Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people from the city were with her.

13. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Do not weep.

14. And he came and touched the coffin, and those who bore it stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to you, Arise.

15. And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him back to his mother.

16. And fear came upon them all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God has visited his people.

17. And this report of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the surrounding region.

18. And the disciples of John told him of all these things.

19. And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he who is to come? or should we look for another?

20. When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who is to come? or should we look for another?

21. And in that same hour he cured many people of their diseases and afflictions, and of evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.

22. Then Jesus answered and said to them, Go your way, and tell John the things you have seen and heard; how the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is preached to the poor.

23. And blessed is he who does not stumble over me.

24. And when the messengers of John departed, he began to speak to the people about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

25. But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live luxuriously, are in kings' courts.

26. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.

28. For I say to you, Among those born of women there is none greater than John: but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

29. And all the people who heard him, and the tax gatherers, acknowledged the ways of God were just, for they had been baptized with the baptism of John.

30. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.

31. And the Lord said, To what shall I compare the men of this generation? and what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We played the pipes for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge for you, and you did not weep.

33. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a devil.

34. The Son of man comes eating and drinking; and you say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of tax gatherers and sinners!

35. But wisdom is justified by all her children.

36. And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and reclined at table.

37. And, behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that Jesus was at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of perfume,

38. And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume.

39. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is who touches him: for she is a sinner.

40. And Jesus answered him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Say it, Teacher.

41. There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

42. And when they were unable to repay, he freely forgave them both. Now, which of them will love him most?

43. Simon answered, I suppose the one whom he forgave the most. And he said to him, You have judged correctly.

44. And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered your house: you gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.

45. You gave me no kiss: but since I came in this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet.

46. You did not anoint my head with oil: but this woman has anointed my feet with perfume.

47. Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but he who is forgiven little, loves little.

48. And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.

49. And those who reclined at table with him began to say among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?

50. And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.

## Luke 8

1. And it came to pass soon after, that he went through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the glad news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,

2. Along with certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven devils had gone out,

3. And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who helped support them out of their own means.

4. And when many people were gathered together, and came to him from town after town, he spoke in a parable:

5. A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.

6. And some fell upon the rock; and as soon as it had sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.

7. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.

8. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore a crop a hundred times as great. And when he said these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

9. And his disciples asked him, What does this parable mean?

10. And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others it is in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

11. Now the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

12. Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes, and takes the word from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

13. Those on the rock are the ones, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but they have no root; they believe for a while, but in time of temptation fall away.

14. And the seed which fell among thorns are those, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.

15. But the seed on the good ground are those, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

16. No man, when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a stand, that those who enter may see the light.

17. For nothing is hidden, that shall not be disclosed; nor anything secret, that shall not be made known and come into the open.

18. Therefore, take heed how you listen: for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.

19. Then his mother and brothers came to him, and could not reach him because of the crowd.

20. And he was told, Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.

21. And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and do it.

22. Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he got into a boat with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

23. But as they sailed he fell asleep: and a storm of wind came down upon the lake; and they were filling with water, and were in danger.

24. And they came to him, and woke him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they were afraid and amazed, saying to one another, Who is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him.

26. And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.

27. And when he stepped onto the land, he was met by a man from the city, who had devils, and for a long time had worn no clothes, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.

28. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of God most high? I beg you, do not torment me.

29. (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had seized him: and though he was kept under guard, bound with chains and in fetters; he would break the bonds and be driven by the devil into the desert.)

30. And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion: because many devils had entered into him.

31. And they begged him that he would not command them to go out into the abyss.

32. Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain: and they begged him to let them enter these. And he gave them permission.

33. Then the devils went out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were drowned.

34. When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.

35. Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the devils had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

36. Those who saw it happen told them how he who was possessed by the devils was healed.

37. Then all the people from the region of the Gerasenes begged him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he got into the boat, and returned.

38. Now the man out of whom the devils had gone begged to be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

39. Return to your own house, and describe what great things God has done for you. And he went his way, and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.

40. And it came to pass, that when Jesus returned, the people welcomed him: for they were all waiting for him.

41. And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged him to come to his house:

42. For he had only one daughter, about twelve years old, and she lay dying. But as he went the people crowded around him.

43. And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,

44. Came up behind him, and touched the edge of his garment: and immediately the flow of blood stopped.

45. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When they all denied it, Peter said, Master, the multitudes crowd and press around you.

46. And Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I know that power has gone out of me.

47. And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling, fell down before him, and told him before all the people why she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed.

48. And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.

49. While he was speaking, a man came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, and said to him, Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher further.

50. But when Jesus heard this, he said, Do not fear: only believe, and she shall be made well.

51. And when he came into the house, he allowed no one to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.

52. And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeps.

53. And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

54. And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Child, arise.

55. And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately: and he commanded that she be given food.

56. And her parents were astonished: but he directed them to tell no one what had happened.

## Luke 9

1. Then he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

2. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

3. And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, no staff, no bag, no bread, no money; not even an extra tunic.

4. And whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the town.

5. And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.

6. And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.

7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening: and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead;

8. And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets had risen again.

9. And Herod said, I beheaded John: but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

10. And the apostles, when they returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into the city of Bethsaida.

11. And the people, when they learned of it, followed him: and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.

12. And when the day began to wear away, the twelve came, and said to him, Send the crowd away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and find lodging and food: for we are here in a remote place.

13. But he said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish; unless we go and buy food for all these people.

14. For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.

15. And they did so, and made them all sit down.

16. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.

17. And they ate, and were all filled: and they picked up twelve baskets of broken pieces that remained.

18. And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, Who do the people say that I am?

19. They answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.

20. He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, The Christ of God.

21. And he strictly warned them, and commanded them not to tell this to anyone;

22. Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised on the third day.

23. And he said to them all, If anyone will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

24. For whoever will save his life shall lose it: but whoever will lose his life for my sake, he shall save it.

25. For what advantage is there for a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?

26. For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his glory, and the glory of his Father, and of the holy angels.

27. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.

28. And it came to pass about eight days after these teachings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.

29. And as he prayed, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white.

30. And, behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah:

31. Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he would accomplish at Jerusalem.

32. But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.

33. And it came to pass, as the two men departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: let us make three shelters; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: but he did not know what he was saying.

34. While he spoke, a cloud came and enveloped them: and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.

35. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my Chosen: hear him.

36. And when the voice had spoken, they found Jesus was alone. And they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of those things which they had seen.

37. And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the hill, many people met him.

38. And, behold, a man of the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I beg you, look upon my son: for he is my only child.

39. And, lo, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it convulses him until he foams at the mouth, and it mauls him and hardly ever leaves him.

40. And I begged your disciples to cast it out; but they could not.

41. And Jesus answered, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and endure you? Bring your son here.

42. And as he was coming, the devil threw him down, and violently convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.

43. And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all marvelling at everything Jesus did, he said to his disciples,

44. Let these words sink down into your ears: the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.

45. But they did not understand this statement, and it was hidden from them, so they did not understand it: and they were afraid to ask him about it.

46. Then there arose a dispute among them about which of them was the greatest.

47. And Jesus, perceiving what they were thinking in their hearts, took a child, and put him beside him,

48. And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever shall receive me receives him who sent me: for he who is least among you, that one shall be great.

49. And John answered, Master, we saw someone casting out devils in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow along with us.

50. And Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him: for he who is not against you is for you.

51. And it came to pass, when the time had come for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem,

52. And sent messengers ahead of him: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

53. But they did not receive him, because his face was set to go to Jerusalem.

54. And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?

55. But he turned, and rebuked them,

56. And they went to another village.

57. And it came to pass, that, as they went along the way, a man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.

58. And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.

59. And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.

60. Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their own dead: but you go and preach the kingdom of God.

61. And another said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid farewell to those who are at my home.

62. And Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

## Luke 10

1. After these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and sent them out two by two before him into every town and place where he would go.

2. And he said to them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

3. Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

4. Carry neither purse, nor bag, nor sandals: and greet no man along the way.

5. And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.

6. And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon him: if not, it shall turn to you.

7. Remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.

8. And into whatever town you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:

9. And heal the sick who are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you.

10. But into whatever town you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,

11. Even the very dust of your town, which clings to us, we wipe off against you: nevertheless, be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.

12. I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that town.

13. Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.

15. And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven; you shall be thrust down to Hades.

16. He who hears you hears me; and he who despises you despises me; and he who despises me despises him who sent me.

17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.

18. And he said to them, I beheld Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

19. Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

20. Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.

21. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes: yea, Father; for so it seemed good in your sight.

22. All things have been given to me by my Father: and no man knows who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

23. And he turned to his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see:

24. For I tell you, that many prophets and kings desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.

25. And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tested him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

26. He said to him, What is written in the law? how do you read it?

27. And he answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself.

28. And he said to him, You have answered right: do this, and you shall live.

29. But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour?

30. And Jesus answered, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

31. And by chance a certain priest came down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

32. And likewise a Levite, when he came to that place and saw him, passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

34. And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. And on the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come again, I will repay you.

36. Now which of these three, do you think, was a neighbour to him who fell among the robbers?

37. And he said, He who showed mercy on him. Then Jesus said to him, Go, and do likewise.

38. Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a woman named Martha received him into her house.

39. And she had a sister named Mary, who sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his words.

40. But Martha was distracted by many tasks, and came to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? then tell her to help me.

41. And Jesus answered her, Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things:

42. But only one thing is necessary: and Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

## Luke 11

1. And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

2. And he said to them, when you pray, say, Father, Hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.

3. Give us day by day our daily bread.

4. And forgive our sins; for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.

5. And he said to them, Suppose you have a friend and go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

6. For a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.

7. And from within he shall answer and say, Do not trouble me: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you anything.

8. I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as much as he needs.

9. And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

10. For every one who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks it shall be opened.

11. Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?

12. Or if he asks for an egg, will offer him a scorpion?

13. If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?

14. And he was casting out a devil that was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil had gone out, the dumb man spoke; and the crowd was amazed.

15. But some of them said, He casts out devils by Beelzebub, the chief of the devils.

16. And others, tempting him, sought from him a sign from heaven.

17. But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against itself falls.

18. If Satan is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? for you say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.

19. And if I cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

20. But if I cast out devils by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

21. When a strong man, fully armed, guards his house, his goods are safe:

22. But when one stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armour in which he trusted, and divides the spoils.

23. He who is not with me is against me: and he who does not gather with me scatters.

24. When an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, it passes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came.

25. And when it comes, it finds it swept and in order.

26. Then it goes, and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself; and they enter in, and live there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

27. And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman in the crowd lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which you sucked.

28. But he said, Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.

29. And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: it seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.

30. For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of man be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, one greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, one greater than Jonah is here.

33. No man, after lighting a lamp, puts it in a cellar, or under a bushel, but on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light.

34. The light of the body is the eye: therefore when your eye is good, your whole body also is full of light; but when your eye is bad, your body also is full of darkness.

35. Take heed, then, that the light which is within you is not darkness.

36. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, having no dark part in it, it shall be fully illuminated, as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light.

37. And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee begged him to dine with him: and he went in, and reclined at the table.

38. And the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that he had not first washed before dinner.

39. And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.

40. You fools, did not he who made the outside also make the inside?

41. But rather give what you have within as alms; and, behold, all things are clean for you.

42. But woe to you, Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, but neglect justice and the love of God: these you ought to have done, and not left the others undone.

43. Woe to you, Pharisees! for you love the best seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the marketplaces.

44. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over unaware.

45. Then one of the lawyers answered him, Teacher, by saying this you insult us also.

46. And he said, Woe to you also, lawyers! for you load men with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. Woe to you! for you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. Truly you bear witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers: for they killed them, and you build their tombs.

49. For this reason also the wisdom of God said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall kill and persecute,

50. That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

51. From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple: truly I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.

52. Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you did not enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in you hindered.

53. And as he left, the scribes and Pharisees began to be hostile, and to question him closely on many things:

54. Lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

## Luke 12

1. In the meantime, when a great crowd of people had gathered, so that they trod upon each other, he began to say first to his disciples, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; nor hidden, that shall not be known.

3. Therefore, whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which you have spoken in the ear behind closed doors shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

4. And I say to you, my friends, Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

5. But I will warn you whom to fear: Fear him, who after he has killed has power to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, Fear him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for twopence, and not one of them is forgotten before God?

7. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore do not fear: you are of more value than many sparrows.

8. And I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:

9. But he who denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

10. And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven.

11. And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and authorities, take no thought of how you shall defend yourself, or what you shall say:

12. For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.

13. And one of the company said to him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.

14. And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

15. And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of every form of greed: for a man's life does not consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses.

16. And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

17. And he thought to himself, What shall I do, because I have no room to store my crops?

18. And he said, This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones; and there I will store all my grain and goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

20. But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then who shall own those things, which you have prepared?

21. So it is with him who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.

22. And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat; or for the body, what you shall put on.

23. For life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.

24. Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storehouse or barn; yet God feeds them: how much more valuable are you than the birds!

25. And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?

26. If you then are not able to do such a small thing, why are you anxious about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not toil or spin; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

28. If then God so clothes the grass, which is in the field today, and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?

29. And do not seek what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, and do not be of an anxious mind.

30. For the nations of the world seek after all these things: and your Father knows that you have need of them.

31. But rather seek the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.

32. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell what you have, and give alms; provide yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure in heaven that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.

34. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

35. Be dressed and ready, and keep your lamps burning;

36. And be like men who wait for their lord to return from the wedding feast; that when he comes and knocks, they may open the door for him immediately.

37. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord shall find watching when he comes: truly I say to you, that he shall dress himself to serve, and make them sit down at the table, and will come forth and serve them.

38. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

39. And know this, that if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

40. Therefore you be ready also: for the Son of man will come at a hour when you do not expect.

41. Then Peter said to him, Lord, are you speaking this parable to us, or to everyone?

42. And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his servants, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?

43. Blessed is that servant, whom his lord shall find so doing when he comes.

44. Truly I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.

45. But if that servant says in his heart, My lord delays his coming; and begins to beat the menservants and maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

46. The lord of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him, and at a hour he is not aware of, and will cut him in pieces, and will assign him a place with the unbelievers.

47. And that servant, who knew his lord's will, and did not prepare himself, and did not do his will, shall be beaten with many blows.

48. But he who did not know, and committed things worthy of a beating, shall be beaten with few blows. For to whomever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask all the more.

49. I have come to send fire on the earth; and how I wish it was already kindled.

50. But I have a baptism to undergo; and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!

51. Do you suppose that I have come to give peace on earth? I tell you, No; but rather division:

52. For from henceforth there shall be five in one house, divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. They shall be divided father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

54. And he also said to the people, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, immediately you say, A shower is coming; and so it does.

55. And when you see the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it comes to pass.

56. You hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that you do not discern this time?

57. And why do you not even judge for yourselves what is right?

58. When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, as you are on the way, make every effort to settle with him, lest he drag you before the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into prison.

59. I tell you, you shall not get out of there, until you have paid the very last farthing.

## Luke 13

1. There were some present at that time who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

2. And Jesus answered, saying to them, Do you suppose these Galilaeans were greater sinners than all the other Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?

3. I tell you, No: but, unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were more guilty than all the men who lived in Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, No: but, unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.

6. Then he spoke this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.

7. Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and have found none: cut it down; why should it use up the ground?

8. And he answered and said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, until I shall dig about it, and put manure on it:

9. And if it bears fruit, fine: and if not, then you can cut it down.

10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

11. And, behold, there was a woman who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years, and was bowed over, and could not straighten up at all.

12. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your sickness.

13. And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she straightened up, and glorified God.

14. And the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, said to the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: therefore come during them and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

15. The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead him away to water?

16. And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?

17. And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced over all the glorious things he was doing.

18. Then he said, What is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?

19. It is like a mustard seed, which a man took, and planted in his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the birds of the air lodged in its branches.

20. And again he said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.

22. And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and traveling toward Jerusalem.

23. Then someone said to him, Lord, will only a few be saved? And he said to them,

24. Strive to enter in at the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

25. When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open up to us; then he shall answer and say to you, I do not know where you are from:

26. Then you shall begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.

27. But he shall say, I tell you, I do not know where you are from; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.

28. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.

29. And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall recline at table in the kingdom of God.

30. And, behold, there are some who are last who shall be first, and there are some who are first who shall be last.

31. That same hour some of the Pharisees came, saying to him, Get away, and depart from here: for Herod wants to kill you.

32. And he said to them, Go tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall complete my course.

33. Nevertheless, I must journey on today, and tomorrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not allow it!

35. Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and truly I say to you, You shall not see me, until the time comes when you shall say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

## Luke 14

1. And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat on the sabbath day, that they watched him.

2. And, behold, there was a certain man in front of him who had dropsy.

3. And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, asking, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

4. But they held their peace. And he took hold of him, and healed him, and let him go;

5. And answered them, saying, If one of you has a son or an ox fall into a pit on the sabbath day, which of you will not immediately pull him out?

6. And they could not answer these things.

7. And he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honour; saying to them,

8. When you are invited by someone to a wedding, do not sit down at the place of honour; for one more distinguished than you may have been invited;

9. And he who invited both of you will come and say to you, Give this man your place; and with shame you will begin to take the lowest place.

10. But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place; that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then you shall have honour in the presence of those who are at the table with you.

11. For whoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.

12. Then he said to his host, When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your kinsmen, or your rich neighbours; lest they invite you in return, and you are repaid.

13. But when you have a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:

14. And you shall be blessed; for they cannot repay you: but you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.

15. And when one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

16. Then he said to him, A certain man made a great banquet, and invited many:

17. And at the banquet time he sent his servant to say to those who were invited, Come; for everything is now ready.

18. And they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I must go and see it: Please excuse me.

19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out: Please excuse me.

20. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

21. So the servant returned, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the crippled, and the blind, and the lame.

22. And the servant said, Lord, it has been done as you have commanded, and yet there is still room.

23. And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and along the hedgerows, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

24. For I say to you, That none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.

25. And great multitudes went with him: and he turned, and said to them,

26. If anyone comes to me, and does not hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yea, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.

27. And whoever does not carry his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.

28. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has sufficient money to finish it?

29. Lest perhaps, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all who behold it will begin to mock him,

30. Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

31. Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first, and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?

32. Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation, and asks terms of peace.

33. So likewise, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has, cannot be my disciple.

34. Salt is good: but if it has lost its taste, how shall it be made salty again?

35. It is fit for neither the land or the manure pile; it is cast out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

## Luke 15

1. Then all the tax gatherers and sinners drew near to hear him.

2. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners, and eats with them.

3. And he spoke this parable to them, saying,

4. What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?

5. And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.

7. I say to you, that likewise there shall be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous persons, who do not need to repent.

8. Or what woman, having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she finds it?

9. And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the coin which I had lost.

10. Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.

11. And he said, A certain man had two sons:

12. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me my part of the estate. So he divided his property between them.

13. And not many days after the younger son gathered everything together, and took a journey into a far country, and there wasted his estate with riotous living.

14. And when he had spent everything, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.

15. And he went and hired himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

16. And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods the swine were eating: but no man gave him anything.

17. And when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough to spare, and I perish with hunger!

18. I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight,

19. And am no longer worthy to be called your son: treat me as one of your hired servants.

20. And he arose, and went to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him.

21. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.

22. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet:

23. And bring the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:

24. For this son of mine was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

25. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.

27. And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.

28. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father came out, and pleaded with him.

29. And he answered his father, Lo, these many years I have served you and never disobeyed your commandment: and yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:

30. But as soon as this son of yours comes home, who has devoured your estate with prostitutes, you kill for him the fatted calf.

31. And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.

32. But we had to make merry, and be glad: for this brother of yours was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

## Luke 16

1. And he also said to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward, and charges were brought to him that the steward was wasting his goods.

2. And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear of you? give an account of your stewardship; for you may no longer be steward.

3. Then the steward said to himself, What shall I do? for my lord is taking away my stewardship: I am not strong enough to dig; and I am ashamed to beg.

4. I know what to do, so that when I am put out of the stewardship, people will receive me into their houses.

5. So he called in every one of his lord's debtors, and said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord?

6. And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

7. Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.

8. And the lord commended the dishonest steward, because he had acted shrewdly: for the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with own kind than are the children of light.

9. And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves using worldly wealth; that, when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal habitations.

10. He who is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he who is dishonest in the least is also dishonest in much.

11. Therefore, if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches?

12. And if you have not been faithful with that which is another man's, who shall give you possessions of your own?

13. No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.

14. The Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.

15. And he said to them, You justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

16. The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man forces his way into it.

17. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the law to fail.

18. Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

19. There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day:

20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, covered with sores,

21. And he longed to eat the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

22. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

23. And in Hades he lift up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. And he cried out, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus received evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.

26. And beside all this, between us and you a great gulf has been fixed: so that those who would pass from here to you cannot; nor can any pass over from there to us.

27. He said, Then I beg you, father, that you would send him to my father's house:

28. For I have five brothers. Have him warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

29. Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

30. And he said, No, father Abraham: but if someone went to them from the dead, they will repent.

31. And he said to him, If they will not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.

## Luke 17

1. Then he said to the disciples, It is certain that stumbling blocks will come: but woe to him through whom they come!

2. It would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and be cast into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.

3. Be on your guard: If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.

4. And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times a day comes to you, saying, I repent; you must forgive him.

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.

6. And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, Be plucked up by the root, and be planted in the sea; and it would obey you.

7. But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Go sit down to eat?

8. Will he not rather say to him, Make something for my supper, and gird yourself, and serve me until I eat and drink; and afterward you shall eat and drink?

9. Does he thank that servant because he did as he was commanded?

10. So likewise you, when you have done all those things which are commanded of you, say, We are unworthy servants: we have merely done our duty.

11. And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed between Samaria and Galilee.

12. And as he entered into a certain village, ten leprous men met him. They stood at a distance,

13. And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

14. And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,

16. And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

17. And Jesus answered, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?

18. Was no one found who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner.

19. And he said to him, Arise, go your way: your faith has made you well.

20. And when he was asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with signs:

21. Nor shall they say, Look, here it is! or, look there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

22. And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.

23. And they shall say to you, See here!; or, see there!: do not go not after them, or follow them.

24. For as the lightning flashes in one part of the sky and shines to the other; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.

25. But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.

26. As it was in the days of Noah, so it shall also be in the days of the Son of man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

28. It was the same in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;

29. But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

30. Even so shall it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed.

31. On that day, let him who is upon the housetop, and his goods in the house, not come down to take them away: and likewise let not him who is in the field turn back.

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

34. I tell you, in that night two shall be in one bed; one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

35. Two women shall be grinding together; one shall be taken, and the other left.

36. [Two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken, and the other left.]

37. And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the body is, there will the vultures be gathered.

## Luke 18

1. And he spoke a parable to them to show that men ought always to pray, and not loose heart;

2. Saying, There was a judge in a city, who did not fear God or respect man:

3. And there was a widow in that city; and she kept coming to him, saying, Give me justice against my adversary.

4. And he would not for a while: but afterward he said to himself, Though I do not fear God or respect man;

5. Yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her justice, lest by her continual coming she wear me out.

6. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.

7. And shall not God vindicate his elect, who cry day and night to him, and will he delay long with them?

8. I tell you that he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?

9. And he spoke this parable to certain people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax gatherer.

11. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax gatherer.

12. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

13. And the tax gatherer, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but beat upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me, a sinner.

14. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one who exalts himself shall be abased; and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.

15. And they also brought infants to him, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw this, they rebuked them.

16. But Jesus called them to him, and said, Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God.

17. Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall by no means enter it.

18. And a certain ruler asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

19. And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? no one is good, except God alone.

20. You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour your father and your mother.

21. And he said, All these I have kept from my youth up.

22. Now when Jesus heard this, he said to him, You still lack one thing: sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

23. And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.

24. And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!

25. It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.

26. And those who heard it said, Who then can be saved?

27. And he said, Things that are impossible with men are possible with God.

28. Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed you.

29. And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. Who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the world to come, life everlasting.

31. Then he took the twelve aside, and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

32. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully treated, and spit upon:

33. And they shall flog him, and put him to death: and on the third day he shall rise again.

34. And they understood none of these things: this saying was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things which were spoken.

35. And it came to pass, that when he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road begging:

36. And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

37. And they told him, Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.

38. And he cried out, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.

39. And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to hold his peace: but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.

40. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he had come near, he asked him,

41. What do you want me to do for you? And he said, Lord, I want to receive my sight.

42. And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight: your faith has healed you.

43. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

## Luke 19

1. And Jesus entered and was passing through Jericho.

2. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, who was the chief among the tax gatherers, and he was rich.

3. And he sought to see who Jesus was; but could not because of the crowd, for he was of small stature.

4. And he ran ahead, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.

5. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must stay at your house.

6. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

7. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.

8. And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any man of anything, I will repay it fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.

11. And while they listened to these things, he told a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.

12. Therefore he said, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and then to return.

13. And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten minas, and said to them, Trade with these until I come.

14. But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.

15. And it came to pass, that when he returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.

16. The first came, saying, Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.

17. And he said to him, Well done, you good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little, take authority over ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has gained five minas.

19. And he said likewise to him, You shall be in authority over five cities.

20. And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief:

21. For I feared you, because you are a severe man: you take up what you have not laid down, and reap what you did not sow.

22. And he said to him, Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:

23. Why then did you not put my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?

24. And he said to those who stood by, Take from him the mina, and give it to him who has ten minas.

25. And they said to him, Lord, he already has ten minas.

26. I say to you, To everyone who has shall more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.

27. As for my enemies, those who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here, and kill them in front of me.

28. And when he had spoken these things, he went on ahead, ascending to Jerusalem.

29. And it came to pass, when he had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,

30. Saying, Go into the village opposite you; and as you enter it you shall find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat: untie it, and bring it here.

31. And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying it? you shall say, Because the Lord has need of it.

32. And those who were sent went their way, and found it as he had said.

33. And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt?

34. And they said, The Lord has need of it.

35. And they brought it to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they put Jesus on it.

36. And as he went, they spread their clothes on the road.

37. And as he was coming near, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;

38. Saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

39. And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.

40. And he answered and said to them, I tell you that if they should hold their peace, the very stones would cry out.

41. And when he had come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,

42. Saying, If you, even you, had only known on this day, the things which make for peace! but now they are hidden from your eyes.

43. For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies shall build an embankment about you, and surround you, and keep you in on every side,

44. And shall level you to the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone upon another; because you did not know the time of your visitation.

45. And he went into the temple, and began to cast out those who were selling;

46. Saying to them, It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves.

47. And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,

48. But could not find what they might do: for all the people hung upon his words.

## Luke 20

1. And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came up to him with the elders,

2. And said to him, Tell us by what authority you do these things? or who it is who gave you this authority?

3. And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and you answer me:

4. The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?

5. And they discussed among themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?

6. But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

7. And they answered that they did not know from where it came.

8. And Jesus said to them, Neither will tell I you by what authority I do these things.

9. Then he began to tell the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to tenants, and went into a far country for a long time.

10. And at harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard: but the tenants beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.

11. He sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.

12. And he sent a third: and they wounded him, and cast him out.

13. Then the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will respect him when they see him.

14. But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

15. So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What then shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?

16. He shall come and destroy these tenants, and shall give the vineyard to others. When they heard this, they said, God forbid.

17. And he looked at them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone?

18. Whoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

19. And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that same hour, for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them; but they feared the people.

20. So they watched him, and sent forth spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in his words, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.

21. And they asked him, Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly, and that you are not partial to any person, but teach the way of God truly:

22. Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?

23. But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,

24. Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it? They answered, Caesar's.

25. And he said to them, Then render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.

26. And they could not trap him in what he said before the people: they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

27. Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, came to him, and they asked him,

28. Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any man's brother dies, leaving a wife and no children, that man should take the widow, and raise up children for his brother.

29. Now there were seven brothers: the first took a wife, and died without children.

30. And the second,

31. And the third took her; as did all seven: and they left no children, and died.

32. Last of all the woman died.

33. Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? for all seven had her as wife.

34. Jesus answered and said to them, The people of this age marry, and are given in marriage:

35. But those who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:

36. Nor can they die any more: for they are like the angels; and are the children of God, since they are children of the resurrection.

37. That the dead are raised, even Moses showed in the account of the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. For he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all are alive to him.

39. Then certain of the scribes answered, Teacher, you have spoken well.

40. And after that they dared not ask him any more questions.

41. And he said to them, How is it that they say the Christ is David's son?

42. David himself says in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,

43. Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.

44. Therefore David calls him Lord; so how is he then his son?

45. Then in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,

46. Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honour at feasts;

47. They devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: they shall receive the greater condemnation.

## Luke 21

1. And he looked up, and saw the rich people putting their gifts into the treasury.

2. And he also saw a certain poor widow putting in two small copper coins.

3. And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has put in more than all of them:

4. For all these have given offerings to God out of their abundance: but she in her poverty has put in all she had to live on.

5. And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,

6. As for these things which you behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be one stone left upon another; every one of them shall be thrown down.

7. And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when shall these things happen? and what sign will there be that these things are about to take place?

8. And he said, Take heed that you are not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and, the time draws near: do not go after them.

9. And when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end does not follow immediately.

10. Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:

11. And there shall be great earthquakes in various places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs from heaven.

12. But before all this, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, and you shall be brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.

13. And it shall be a time for you to bear testimony.

14. Therefore, settle it in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how you shall answer:

15. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist or refute.

16. And you shall be betrayed both by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.

17. And you shall be hated by all for my name's sake.

18. But not a hair of your head shall perish.

19. By your perseverance you shall win your souls.

20. And when you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.

21. Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let those who are inside the city depart; and let not those who are in the country enter into it.

22. For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

23. But woe to those who are with child, and to those who nurse infants, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

24. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

25. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth nations shall be distressed and perplexed by the roaring waves of the sea;

26. Men's hearts failing them for fear and foreboding of those things which are coming upon the earth: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

27. And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.

29. And he told them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;

30. When they shoot forth leaves, you see and know for yourselves that summer is at hand.

31. So likewise, when you see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand.

32. Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, until all is fulfilled.

33. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

34. And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation, and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, so that day comes upon you unexpectedly like a snare.

35. For as a snare shall it come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth.

36. Watch therefore, and pray always, that you may be strong and accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. Now in the daytime he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed on the mount that is called Olivet.

38. And all the people came to the temple early in the morning to hear him.

## Luke 22

1. Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.

2. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.

3. Then Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, one the twelve.

4. And he went his way, and discussed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.

5. They were glad, and agreed to give him money.

6. So he consented, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.

7. Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover lamb must be killed.

8. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat it.

9. And they said to him, Where will you have us prepare it?

10. And he said to them, Behold, when you enter the city, a man shall meet you there, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters.

11. And you shall say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

12. And he shall show you a large upper room, furnished: make ready there.

13. And they went, and found it as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.

14. And when the hour had come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.

15. And he said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:

16. For I say to you, I will not eat it again, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:

18. For I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

19. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: do this in remembrance of me.

20. Likewise he took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood.

21. But, behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.

22. Truly the Son of man goes, as it was determined: but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!

23. And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

24. And there was also a dispute among them as to which of them should be accounted the greatest.

25. And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.

26. But not so with you: but he who is greatest among you, let him be as the youngest; and he who rules, as he who serves.

27. For which is greater, he who reclines at table, or he who serves? is it not he who reclines at table? but I am among you as one who serves.

28. You are those who have stood by me in my trials.

29. And I grant to you a kingdom, as my Father has granted to me;

30. That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, that he might sift you as wheat:

32. But I have prayed for you, that your faith will not fail: and when you have turned back, strengthen your brethren.

33. And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you, both into prison, and to death.

34. And he said, I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before you have thrice denied that you know me.

35. And he said to them, When I sent you out without purse, or bag, or sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.

36. Then he said to them, But now, he who has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag: and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

37. For I say to you, that this scripture must yet be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for that which refers to me has its fulfillment.

38. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.

39. And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.

40. When he arrived at the place, he said to them, Pray that you may not enter into temptation.

41. And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down, and prayed,

42. Saying, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.

43. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.

44. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

45. And when he rose up from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

46. And said to them, Why do you sleep? rise and pray, that you may not enter into temptation.

47. And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude came, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.

48. But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?

49. When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

50. And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. And Jesus answered, No more of this. And he touched his ear, and healed him.

52. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and officers of the temple, and the elders, who had come to him, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?

53. When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch forth hands against me: but this is your hour, when darkness reigns.

54. Then they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed from afar.

55. And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and sat down together, Peter sat among them.

56. But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

57. And he denied it, saying, Woman, I do not know him.

58. And after a little while another saw him, and said, You are also one of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

59. And after about an hour another insisted, Truly this man was also with him: for he is a Galilaean.

60. And Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crowed.

61. And the Lord turned, and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock crows today, you shall deny me thrice.

62. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

63. And the men who held Jesus mocked him, and struck him.

64. And they blindfolded him, and struck him on the face, and asked him, Prophesy, who was it who struck you?

65. And they spoke many other insulting things against him.

66. And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,

67. Are you the Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe:

68. And if I question you, you will not answer me.

69. Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.

70. Then they all said, Are you then the Son of God? And he said to them, You say that I am.

71. And they said, What need have we of further testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.

## Luke 23

1. And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give taxes to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

3. And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him, You have said so.

4. Then Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.

5. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning in Galilee and coming all the way to this place.

6. When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilaean.

7. And as soon as he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem at that time.

8. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad: for he had long wanted to see him, because he had heard many things about him; and he hoped to see a miracle done by him.

9. Then he questioned him at length; but he made no answer.

10. The chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

11. And Herod with his men of war treated him with contempt, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

12. And that same day Pilate and Herod became friends: for before there had been enmity between them.

13. And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

14. Said to them, You have brought this man to me, as one who perverts the people: but, behold, having examined him before you, I found no fault in this man regarding those things of which you accuse him:

15. No, nor did Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.

16. Therefore I will chastise him, and release him.

17. [For he was obliged to release one man to them at the feast.]

18. But they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:

19. (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)

20. Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, spoke to them again.

21. But they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

22. And he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death: therefore I will chastise him, and let him go.

23. And they were insistent, with loud voices demanding that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed.

24. So Pilate pronounced the sentence they demanded.

25. And he released to them the one they asked for, he who had been cast into prison for sedition and murder; but he delivered Jesus over to their will.

26. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming in from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it after Jesus.

27. And there followed him a great company of people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.

28. But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

29. For, behold, the days are coming when they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never nursed.

30. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us.

31. For if they do these things when the wood is green, what shall happen when it is dry?

32. And there were also two others, criminals, who were led away with him to be put to death.

33. And when they had come to the place, which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.

34. Then Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they do. And they divided his clothing by casting lots.

35. The people stood watching. And the rulers derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.

36. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him wine vinegar,

37. And saying, If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.

38. Now there was also an inscription written over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. And one of the criminals who was hung there railed at him, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.

40. But the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since you are under the same condemnation?

41. And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing wrong.

42. And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.

43. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with me in paradise.

44. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour,

45. For the sun was darkened. And the veil of the temple was torn in two.

46. And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit: and having said this, he breathed his last.

47. Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

48. And all the people who came together to see the sight, when they saw the things that had taken place, struck their breasts, and returned.

49. And all his acquaintances, and the women who followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

50. Now, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council; a good man, and just:

51. (Who had not consented to their decision and deed;) a man from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God.

52. This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.

53. And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb cut into the stone, where no man had ever before been laid.

54. It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath drew near.

55. Now the women who came with him from Galilee, followed behind, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.

56. Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the sabbath day according to the commandment.

## Luke 24

1. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.

2. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

3. They entered, but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

5. They were afraid, and bowed their faces to the earth, and the men said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, but has risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,

7. Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

8. And they remembered his words,

9. And returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

10. They were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.

11. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them.

12. Then Peter arose, and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering to himself at that which had come to pass.

13. And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.

14. And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

15. And it came to pass, that, while they were conversing and discussing, Jesus himself drew near, and went along with them.

16. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.

17. And he said to them, What is it that you are discussing with each other as you walk? And they stood still, looking downcast.

18. And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know the things which have come to pass there in these days?

19. And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:

20. And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.

21. But we trusted that it was he who would redeem Israel: and beside all this, today is the third day since these things happened.

22. Yea, and certain women of our company astonished us, for they were at the tomb early;

23. And they did not find his body. They came back, saying that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.

24. And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said: but him they did not see.

25. Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:

26. Was it not necessary for the Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

27. And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all the things concerning himself in the scriptures.

28. And they drew near to the village, where they were going: and he acted as though he would have gone farther.

29. But they urged him strongly, saying, Stay with us: for it is getting toward evening, and the day is nearly over. And he went in to stay with them.

30. And it came to pass, as he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight.

32. And they said to one another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us along the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

33. They rose up that same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, along with those who were with them,

34. Saying, The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.

35. And they told what had happened on the road, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of bread.

36. And as they spoke of this, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, Peace be with you.

37. But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they were seeing a spirit.

38. And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do doubts arise in your hearts?

39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: touch me, and see; for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.

40. And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.

41. And while they still did not believe because of joy, and marvelled, he said to them, Have you anything here to eat?

42. And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.

43. And he took it, and ate it before them.

44. He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which are written about me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms.

45. Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures,

46. And said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise from the dead on the third day:

47. And that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. You are witnesses of these things.

49. And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.

50. And he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

51. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

52. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:

53. And were continually in the temple, praising God.
