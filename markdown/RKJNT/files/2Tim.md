# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

2. To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience, as without ceasing I remember you night and day in my prayers.

4. Remembering your tears, I greatly desire to see you, that I may be filled with joy;

5. I am reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded is in you also.

6. Therefore, I would remind you to stir into flame the gift of God, which is in you by the laying on of my hands.

7. For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of self-discipline.

8. Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but share in the afflictions of the gospel, by the power of God;

9. Who has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not by virtue of our works, but because of his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,

10. But has now been made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.

11. Of this gospel I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher,

12. And for this reason I also suffer these things: nevertheless, I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him until that day.

13. Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.

14. That good thing which was committed to you, guard by the Holy Spirit, who dwells within us.

15. This you know, that all those who are in Asia have turned away from me; among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

16. May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains:

17. But when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.

18. May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day. You know very well in how many ways he ministered to me at Ephesus.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

2. And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.

3. Therefore endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

4. No soldier on active service entangles himself with the affairs of civilian life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier.

5. And if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.

6. The farmer who labours must be first to partake of the fruits.

7. Consider what I say; and the Lord will give you understanding in all things.

8. Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David, according to my gospel,

9. For which I suffer hardship, even wearing chains like a criminal; but the word of God is not in chains.

10. Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the chosen, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with its eternal glory.

11. This is a faithful saying: If we died with him, we shall also live with him:

12. If we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he will deny us:

13. If we are faithless, yet he remains faithful: for he cannot deny himself.

14. Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them before the Lord not to dispute about words, which is of no profit, but ruins the hearers.

15. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.

16. But avoid godless and empty chatter: for it will lead people to more ungodliness,

17. And their word will spread like gangrene. Among these are Hymenaeus and Philetus;

18. Who have strayed from the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and thus upset the faith of some.

19. Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands firm, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his. And, Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.

20. In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay; some for noble purposes, and some for ignoble.

21. Therefore, if a man purifies himself from the ignoble, he shall be a vessel for noble purposes, consecrated and useful to the master, prepared for every good work.

22. Flee youthful lusts: and follow righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.

23. Have nothing to do with foolish and ignorant controversies, knowing that they breed strife.

24. And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome; but kind to all, able to teach, forbearing,

25. In gentleness correcting those who oppose him; that God might grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth;

26. And that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But know this also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

2. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,

3. Without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, intemperate, fierce, despisers of good,

4. Treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God;

5. Holding to a form of godliness, but denying its power. From such men turn away.

6. For among them are those who creep into houses, and lead captive weak-willed women laden with sins, led away by various desires,

7. Ever learning, but never able to acknowledge the truth.

8. Now as Jannes and Jambres defied Moses, so these men also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, rejected as concerns the faith.

9. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be made clear to all, as was that of those two.

10. But you have fully known my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,

11. Persecutions, afflictions, such as befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; the persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

12. Yes, and all who will live godly lives in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

13. But evil men and impostors shall grow worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

14. But you, continue to hold the things which you have learned and have been convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them;

15. And how from childhood you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

17. That the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for all good works.

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I solemnly charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom;

2. Preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all patience and instruction.

3. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but having itching ears, they shall gather up teachers for themselves to suit their own desires;

4. And they shall turn their ears away from the truth, and shall turn aside to myths.

5. But you, be steady in all things; endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

6. For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.

7. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:

8. Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me on that day: and not only to me, but also to all those who have longed for his appearing.

9. Make every effort to come to me shortly:

10. For Demas, having loved this present world, has forsaken me and has departed to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.

11. Only Luke is with me. Get Mark, and bring him with you: for he is useful to me for the ministry.

12. Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.

13. When you come, bring with you the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, and especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm: the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.

15. You also beware of him; for he has greatly opposed our message.

16. At my first defence no man stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be counted against them.

17. But the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

18. And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom: to him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

19. Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.

21. Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

22. The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
