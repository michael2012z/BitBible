# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

2. Abraham was the father of Isaac; and Isaac the father of Jacob; and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers;

3. And Judah the father of Perez and Zarah by Tamar; and Perez the father of Hezron; and Hezron the father of Ram;

4. And Ram the father of Amminadab; and Amminadab the father of Nahshon; and Nahshon the father of Salma;

5. And Salma the father of Boaz by Rahab; and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth; and Obed the father of Jesse;

6. And Jesse the father of David the king; and David the king the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah;

7. And Solomon the father of Rehoboam; and Rehoboam the father of Abijah; and Abijah the father of Asa;

8. And Asa the father of Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram; and Joram the father of Azariah;

9. And Azariah the father of Jotham; and Jotham the father of Ahaz; and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah;

10. And Hezekiah the father of Manasseh; and Manasseh the father of Amon; and Amon the father of Josiah;

11. And Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:

12. And after the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel; and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel;

13. And Zerubbabel the father of Abiud; and Abiud the father of Eliakim; and Eliakim the father of Azor;

14. And Azor the father of Zadok; and Zadok the father of Achim; and Achim the father of Eliud;

15. And Eliud the father of Eleazar; and Eleazar the father of Matthan; and Matthan the father of Jacob;

16. And Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

17. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the exile to Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the exile to Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.

18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened in this way: When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.

19. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to disgrace her, decided to divorce her secretly.

20. But while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.

21. And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

22. Now all this was done to fulfill that which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

23. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which translated means, God with us.

24. Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took her as his wife:

25. And kept her a virgin until she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.

## Matthew 2

1. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem,

2. Saying, Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.

3. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

4. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

5. And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it was written by the prophet,

6. And you Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of you shall come a Governor, who shall rule my people Israel.

7. Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, ascertained from them at what time the star appeared.

8. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word, that I may come and worship him also.

9. When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.

10. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

11. And when they had come into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.

12. And being warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.

13. And when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the child, to destroy him.

14. And he arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt:

15. And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt I have called my son.

16. Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent forth, and killed all the children who were in Bethlehem, and in all the region, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.

17. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,

18. In Rama there was heard a voice, weeping, and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, because they were no more.

19. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

20. Saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel: for those who sought the child's life are dead.

21. And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel.

22. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there: and, being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside to the regions of Galilee:

23. And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth: that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.

## Matthew 3

1. In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,

2. And saying, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

3. For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, when he said, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

4. And John had a garment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then Jerusalem, and all Judaea, went out to him, and all the region around the Jordan,

6. And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come for baptism, he said to them, You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Therefore, bring forth fruit in keeping with repentance:

9. And do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

10. And now the axe is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.

11. I baptize you with water for repentance: but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire.

12. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

13. Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.

14. But John tried to prevent him, saying, I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?

15. And Jesus answered him, Let it be so now: for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he consented.

16. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:

17. And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

## Matthew 4

1. Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

2. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.

3. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you are the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.

4. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.

5. Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple,

6. And said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and on their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.

7. Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.

8. Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

9. And said to him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.

10. Then Jesus said to him, Begone, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.

11. Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.

12. Now when Jesus heard that John had been cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;

13. And leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali:

14. That what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,

15. The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

16. The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, a light has sprung up.

17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

18. And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.

19. And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. And they immediately left their nets, and followed him.

21. And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

22. And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.

23. And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of infirmity among the people.

24. And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people who were taken with various diseases and torments, those who were possessed by devils, and those who were epileptic, and paralytics; and he healed them.

25. And great multitudes of people followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.

## Matthew 5

1. And seeing the multitudes, he went up on the mountain: and when he sat down, his disciples came to him:

2. And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

3. Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

4. Blessed are those who mourn: for they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

6. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

9. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.

10. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11. Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.

12. Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

13. You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has lost its taste, with what shall it be salted? it is no longer good for anything, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men.

14. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.

15. Nor do men light a lamp, and put it under a bushel, but on a lampstand; and it gives light to all who are in the house.

16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

17. Do not think that I have come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill.

18. For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke, shall by any means pass away from the law, until all is fulfilled.

19. Therefore, whoever shall break one of the least commandments, and shall so teach men to do, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

20. For I say to you, That unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter into the kingdom of heaven.

21. You have heard that it was said to them of old, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be subject to judgment:

22. But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.

23. Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you;

24. Leave your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.

25. Come to terms with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him; lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.

26. Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out of there, until you have paid the last farthing.

27. You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery:

28. But I say to you, That whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. And if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is better for you that one of your members should perish, than that your whole body should be cast into hell.

30. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is better for you that one of your members should perish, than that your whole body should be cast into hell.

31. It has been said, Whoever shall divorce his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce:

32. But I say to you, That whoever shall divorce his wife, except for the cause of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.

33. Again, you have heard that it has been said to them of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall fulfill your oaths to the Lord:

34. But I say to you, Do not swear at all; either by heaven; for it is God's throne:

35. Or by the earth; for it is his footstool: or by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

36. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.

37. But let your statements be, Yes for yes; No for no: for whatever is more than these comes from the evil one.

38. You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:

39. But I say to you, Do not resist evil: but whoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.

40. And if any man wants to sue you, and take away your shirt, let him have your coat also.

41. And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.

42. Give to him who asks from you, and do not turn away from him who would borrow from you.

43. You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbour, and hate your enemy.

44. But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you;

45. That you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

46. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? do not even the tax gatherers do the same?

47. And if you greet your brethren only, what are you doing more than others? do not even the Gentiles do the same?

48. Therefore be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.

## Matthew 6

1. Take heed that you do not practice your righteousness before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.

2. Therefore, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have praise from men. Truly I say to you, They have received their reward.

3. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing:

4. That your alms may be in secret: and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you.

5. And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have received their reward.

6. But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you.

7. But when you pray, do not use meaningless repetition, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their many words.

8. Therefore, do not be like them: for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask him.

9. Therefore, pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be your name.

10. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

11. Give us this day our daily bread.

12. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

13. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

14. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:

15. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

16. Moreover, when you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They have received their reward.

17. But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;

18. That you may not be seen fasting by men, but by your Father who is in secret: and your Father, who sees in secret, shall reward you.

19. Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal:

20. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal:

21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

22. The light of the body is the eye: therefore, if your eye is sound, your whole body shall be full of light.

23. But if your eye is bad, your whole body shall be full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

24. No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

25. Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?

26. Behold the birds of the air: they do not sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?

27. Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to the span of his life?

28. And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, nor do they spin:

29. And yet I say to you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

30. Therefore, if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith?

31. Therefore, do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?

32. After all these things the Gentiles seek: but your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.

33. But seek first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.

34. Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow shall be anxious for itself. Sufficient for each day are the troubles of its own.

## Matthew 7

1. Judge not, that you may not be judged.

2. For in the manner you judge, you shall be judged: and with the measure you use, it shall be measured to you.

3. And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not consider the beam that is in your own eye?

4. Or how can you say to your brother, Let me pull the speck out of your eye; and, behold, a beam is in your own eye?

5. You hypocrite, first remove the beam from your own eye; and then you shall see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

6. Do not give that which is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.

7. Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:

8. For every one who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks it shall be opened.

9. Or what man is there among you, whom, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?

10. Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?

11. If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?

12. Therefore, all things that you would have men do for you, do for them: for this is the law and the prophets.

13. Enter in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there are who enter in by it:

14. But small is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leads to life, and few there are who find it.

15. Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.

16. You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?

17. Even so, every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a bad tree brings forth bad fruit.

18. A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bring forth good fruit.

19. Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.

20. Therefore, by their fruits you shall know them.

21. Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

22. Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name cast out devils? and in your name done many miracles?

23. And then I will declare to them, I never knew you: depart from me, you who work iniquity.

24. Therefore, whoever hears these words of mine, and does them, will be like a wise man, who built his house upon a rock:

25. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it did not fall: for it was founded upon a rock.

26. And every one who hears these words of mine, and does not do them, is like a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:

27. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

28. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:

29. For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

## Matthew 8

1. When he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.

2. And, behold, there came a leper and knelt before him, saying, Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.

3. And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I am willing; be clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no man; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

5. And when Jesus entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, begging him,

6. Saying, Lord, my servant lies at home paralysed, grievously tormented.

7. And Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.

8. The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy for you to come under my roof: but just speak the word, and my servant shall be healed.

9. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.

10. When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, no, not even in Israel.

11. And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall recline at table with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.

12. But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast into the outer darkness: where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so be it done for you. And his servant was healed that same hour.

14. And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.

15. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them.

16. When evening had come, they brought to him many who were possessed by devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all who were sick:

17. That what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.

18. Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave orders to depart to the other side.

19. And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.

20. And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.

21. And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.

22. But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their own dead.

23. And when he entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.

24. And, behold, there arose a great tempest on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

25. And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we are perishing.

26. And he said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.

27. And the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!

28. And when he had come to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, two men possessed by devils met him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.

29. And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? have you come here to torment us before the time?

30. Now there was, a good way off from them, a herd of many swine feeding.

31. So the devils begged him, saying, If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.

32. And he said to them, Go. And when they came out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.

33. And those who kept them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those possessed by the devils.

34. And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they begged him that he would depart out of their region.

## Matthew 9

1. And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came to his own city.

2. And, behold, they brought to him a paralytic man, lying on a mat: and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic; Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven.

3. And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.

4. And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?

5. For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?

6. But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, (then he said to the paralytic,) Arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.

7. And he arose, and departed to his house.

8. But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.

9. And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the tax office: and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

10. And it came to pass, as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax gatherers and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

11. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with tax gatherers and sinners?

12. But when Jesus heard that, he said to them, Those who are whole do not need a physician, but those who are sick.

13. But go and learn what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.

14. Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?

15. And Jesus said to them, Can the wedding guests mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast.

16. No man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.

17. Nor do men put new wine into old wineskins: for if they do, the wineskins burst, and the wine runs out, and the wineskins are destroyed: but they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.

18. While he spoke these things to them, behold, a certain ruler came, and bowed before him, saying, My daughter has just died: but come and lay your hand upon her, and she shall live.

19. And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

20. And, behold, a woman, who had suffered for twelve years with a flow of blood, came up behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:

21. For she said to herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be made well.

22. But Jesus turned around, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, take heart; your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour.

23. And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a noise,

24. He said to them, Depart: for the girl is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.

25. But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.

26. And the report of this went abroad throughout all that region.

27. And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Son of David, have mercy on us.

28. And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.

29. Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to you.

30. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus sternly charged them, saying, See that no man knows of this.

31. When they departed, they spread abroad his fame in all that region.

32. As they were going away, behold, a dumb man possessed by a devil was brought to him.

33. And when the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.

34. But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils by the prince of the devils.

35. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease.

36. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed, and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

37. Then he said to his disciples, The harvest truly is plentiful, but the labourers are few;

38. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

## Matthew 10

1. And when he had called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of infirmity.

2. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

3. Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax gatherer; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

4. Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

5. These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans:

6. But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

8. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.

9. Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor copper for your purses,

10. Nor bag for your journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor a staff: for the workman is worthy of his food.

11. And into whatever city or village you shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and abide there until you depart.

12. And when you come into a house, greet it.

13. And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.

14. And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.

15. Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.

16. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: therefore be as wise as serpents, and as harmless as doves.

17. But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

18. And you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles.

19. But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak.

20. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

21. And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.

22. And you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake: but he who endures to the end shall be saved.

23. But when they persecute you in this city, flee into another: for truly I say to you, You shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, before the Son of man comes.

24. The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his master.

25. It is enough for the disciple that he is like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more the members of his household?

26. Therefore, do not fear them: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and nothing hidden, that shall not be made known.

27. What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light: and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.

28. And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father's consent.

30. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Therefore, do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.

32. Whoever shall confess me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.

33. But whoever shall deny me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.

34. Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth: I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

35. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

36. And a man's foes shall be those of his own household.

37. He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

38. And he who does not take up his cross, and follow after me, is not worthy of me.

39. He who finds his life shall lose it: and he who loses his life for my sake shall find it.

40. He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.

41. He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.

42. And whoever shall give to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink because he is my disciple, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.

## Matthew 11

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.

2. Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent word by two of his disciples,

3. And said to him, Are you he who is to come, or should we look for another?

4. Jesus answered them, Go and tell John those things which you hear and see:

5. The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.

6. And blessed is he who does not find cause to stumble over me.

7. And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

8. But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.

9. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

10. For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.

11. Truly I say to you, Among those who are born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist: yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

12. And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.

13. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

14. And if you will receive it, he is Elijah, who was to come.

15. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

16. But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,

17. And saying, We have piped for you, and you have not danced; we have mourned for you, and you have not lamented.

18. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.

19. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax gatherers and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her deeds.

20. Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent:

21. Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

23. And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? you shall be brought down to Hades: for if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

24. But I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.

25. At that time Jesus said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.

26. Yes, Father: for so it seemed good in your sight.

27. All things have been delivered to me by my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; nor does any man know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

28. Come to me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest for your souls.

30. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the heads of grain, and to eat.

2. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold, your disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.

3. But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, he and those who were with him;

4. How he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?

5. Or have you not read in the law, that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?

6. But I say to you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.

7. But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.

8. For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.

9. And when he departed from there, he went into their synagogue:

10. And, behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.

11. And he said to them, What man is there among you, if he has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the sabbath day, will not lay hold of it, and lift it out?

12. How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.

13. Then he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored, whole like the other.

14. Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.

15. But Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

16. And charged them that they should not make him known:

17. That what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,

18. Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim justice to the Gentiles.

19. He shall not quarrel, nor cry out; nor shall any man hear his voice in the streets.

20. A bruised reed he shall not break, and a smoking wick he shall not quench, until he brings justice to victory.

21. And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.

22. Then was brought to him one possessed by a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw.

23. And all the people were amazed, and said, Is this not the son of David?

24. But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow casts out devils only by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.

25. And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

26. And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?

27. And if I cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

28. But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

29. Or how can one enter a strong man's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.

30. He who is not with me is against me; and he who does not gather with me scatters.

31. Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven men.

32. And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.

33. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.

34. You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things: and an evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things.

36. But I say to you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account of on the day of judgment.

37. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.

38. Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we wish see a sign from you.

39. But he answered them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah:

40. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

41. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, one greater than Jonah is here.

42. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the remotest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, one greater than Solomon is here.

43. When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, it passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.

44. Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came; and when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.

45. Then it goes, and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in and live there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.

46. While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, desiring to speak with him.

47. Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to speak with you.

48. But he answered and said to him who told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?

49. And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!

50. For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother.

## Matthew 13

1. That same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea.

2. And great multitudes gathered around him, so that he went into a boat, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

3. And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

4. And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them:

5. Some fell upon stony places, where they did not have much earth: and at once they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil:

6. And when the sun came up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

7. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up, and choked them:

8. But other seeds fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

9. He who has ears, let him hear.

10. And the disciples came, and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables?

11. He answered them, It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.

12. For whoever has, to him shall more be given, and he shall have an abundance: but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away.

13. Therefore, I speak to them in parables: because seeing they see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, who says, You shall continue to hear, but not understand; and you shall continue to see, but not perceive:

15. For this people's heart has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

16. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.

17. For truly I say to you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.

18. Hear then the parable of the sower.

19. When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes, and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown by the wayside.

20. The seed sown upon stony places is he who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy;

21. Yet he has no root in himself, and endures only for a while: when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he falls away.

22. The seed sown among the thorns is he who hears the word; and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

23. But the seed sown on the good ground is he who hears the word, and understands it; he also bears fruit, and brings forth, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.

24. He put forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field:

25. But while everyone slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.

26. But when the wheat had sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then the tares appeared also.

27. So the servants of the landowner came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? where then did the tares come from?

28. He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Do you wish for us to go and gather them up?

29. But he said, No; lest while you gather up the tares, you also pull up the wheat with them.

30. Let both grow together until the harvest: and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

31. He put forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:

32. It is the smallest of all seeds: but when it is fully grown, it is the largest of the garden plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.

33. He spoke another parable to them; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.

34. All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and he spoke nothing to them without using a parable,

35. That what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

36. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.

37. He answered them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man;

38. The field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; but the tares are the sons of the wicked one;

39. The enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

40. Therefore, as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be at the end of this age.

41. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity;

42. And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

43. Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again, then for joy went and sold all that he had, and bought that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.

46. When he found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind:

48. Which, when it was full, they drew it to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

49. So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and separate the wicked from among the just,

50. And shall cast them into the furnace of fire, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

51. Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to him, Yes.

52. Then he said to them, Therefore every scribe who is instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is an owner of a house, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.

53. And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.

54. And when he had come to his home town, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Where did this man get this wisdom, and these miracles?

55. Is this not the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?

56. And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?

57. And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, except in his home town, and in his own house.

58. And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

2. And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead; and therefore miraculous powers are at work in him.

3. For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.

4. For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.

5. And although he would have put him to death, he feared the people, because they counted him as a prophet.

6. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.

7. Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.

8. And she, having been prompted by her mother, said, Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter.

9. And the king was sorry: nevertheless, because of his oath and his guests, he commanded that it be given to her.

10. And he sent, and had John beheaded in the prison.

11. And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the girl: and she brought it to her mother.

12. And his disciples came, and took the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.

13. When Jesus heard of it, he departed from there by boat privately into a solitary place: and when the people heard this, they followed him on foot out of the cities.

14. As Jesus went ashore, and saw a great multitude, he was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

15. And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desolate place, and the day is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.

16. But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; you give them something to eat.

17. And they said to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fish.

18. He said, Bring them here to me.

19. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

20. And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up what remained of the fragments, twelve baskets full.

21. And those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

22. And immediately Jesus made his disciples get into a boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitude away.

23. And when he had sent the multitude away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray: and when evening came, he was there alone.

24. But the boat was now many stadia from the land, tossed by waves: for the wind was contrary.

25. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.

26. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out in fear.

27. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I; do not be afraid.

28. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water.

29. And he said, Come. And Peter got down out of the boat, and walked on the water to Jesus.

30. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.

31. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?

32. And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

33. Then those who were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, Truly you are the Son of God.

34. And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.

35. And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought to him all who were diseased;

36. And begged him that they might just touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched it were made perfectly well.

## Matthew 15

1. Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,

2. Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.

3. But he answered and said to them, Why do you transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?

4. For God commanded, saying, Honour your father and mother: and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.

5. But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever of mine might benefit you is a gift to God;

6. Then he is free not to honour his father or his mother. Thus have you made the commandment of God void by your tradition.

7. You hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,

8. This people honours me with their lips; but their hearts are far from me.

9. But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

10. And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:

11. Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.

12. Then his disciples came, and said to him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

13. But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.

14. Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

15. Then Peter answered and said to him, Explain to us this parable.

16. And Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?

17. Do you not yet understand, that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is eliminated?

18. But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.

19. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false witness, slanders:

20. These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.

21. Then Jesus went from there, and departed to the districts of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of that region, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

23. But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us.

24. But he answered and said, I have been sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. Then she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

26. But he answered and said, It is not proper to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

27. And she said, True, Lord: yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.

28. Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it done for you as you wish. And her daughter was made well from that very hour.

29. And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and went up on a mountain, and sat down there.

30. And great multitudes came to him, having with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, dumb, and many others, and put them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them,

31. So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.

32. Then Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint on the way.

33. And his disciples said to him, Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill so great a multitude?

34. And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few little fish.

35. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

36. And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

37. And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up the broken pieces that were left, seven baskets full.

38. And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.

39. And he sent away the multitude, and got into the boat, and came to the region of Magadan.

## Matthew 16

1. The Pharisees and the Sadducees came, and testing him, asked that he would show them a sign from heaven.

2. He answered and said to them, When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

3. And in the morning, It will be foul weather today: for the sky is red and threatening. O you hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky; but can you not discern the signs of the times?

4. A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall be no sign given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed.

5. When they came to the other side of the lake, his disciples found they had forgotten to take bread.

6. Then Jesus said to them, Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

7. And they discussed among themselves, saying, It is because we brought no bread.

8. When Jesus perceived this, he said to them, O you of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have brought no bread?

9. Do you not yet understand; do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?

10. Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?

11. How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but that you should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

12. Then they understood that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

13. When Jesus came to the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is?

14. And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. He said to them, But who do you say that I am?

16. Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

17. And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah: for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.

18. And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

19. And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

20. Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ.

21. From that time forth Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.

22. Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, God forbid it, Lord: this shall not happen to you.

23. But he turned, and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan: you are an offence to me: for you are not thinking of the things of God, but of the things of men.

24. Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

25. For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it: and whoever loses his life for my sake shall find it.

26. For what does it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

27. For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.

28. Truly I say to you, There are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

## Matthew 17

1. And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up a high mountain where they were alone,

2. And was transfigured before them: and his face shone like the sun, and his clothing was white as the light.

3. And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.

4. Then Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you wish, let us make three tabernacles here; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

5. While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and a voice out of the cloud said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him.

6. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.

7. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and do not be afraid.

8. And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus only.

9. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, until the Son of man has risen again from the dead.

10. And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

11. And Jesus answered them, Elijah truly shall come first, and restore all things.

12. But I say to you, That Elijah has already come, and they did not know him, but have done to him whatever they pleased. Likewise shall the Son of man suffer at their hands.

13. Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.

14. And when they had come to the multitude, a certain man came to him, kneeling down before him, and saying,

15. Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and severely vexed: for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.

17. Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you? bring him here to me.

18. And Jesus rebuked the devil; and it departed out of him: and the boy was cured from that very hour.

19. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, Why could we not cast it out?

20. And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Move from here to there; and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible for you.

21. [Yet this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.]

22. And when they came together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

23. And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceedingly sorry.

24. And when they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the tax came to Peter, and said, Does not your teacher pay the tax?

25. He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, What do you think, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take customs or tribute? from their own sons, or from strangers?

26. Peter said to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.

27. But lest we offend them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you have opened its mouth, you shall find a shekel: take that, and give it to them for me and you.

## Matthew 18

1. At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

2. And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the midst of them,

3. And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you are converted, and become like little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

4. Therefore, whoever shall humble himself as this little child, he is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

5. And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me.

6. But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck, and that he be drowned in the depths of the sea.

7. Woe to the world because of temptations! for it must be that temptations come; but woe to that man by whom the temptation comes!

8. Therefore, if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.

9. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out, and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the fire of hell.

10. Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.

11. [For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost.]

12. What do you think? if a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains, and seek the one that has gone astray?

13. And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep, than over the ninety-nine which did not go astray.

14. In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.

15. If your brother shall sin against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.

16. But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established.

17. And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he even refuses to hear the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax gatherer.

18. Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

19. Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth about anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.

20. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

21. Then Peter came to him, and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? up to seven times?

22. Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.

23. Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

24. And when he had begun the settlement, one was brought to him, who owed him ten thousand talents.

25. But because he had nothing with which to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.

26. Therefore the servant fell down, and implored him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.

27. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and released him, and forgave him the debt.

28. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him a hundred denarii: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.

29. And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and begged him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.

30. He refused however, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay the debt.

31. So when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were very sorry, and came and told their lord all that had happened.

32. Then his lord, after he had called him, said to him, You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me:

33. Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?

34. And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the torturers, until he should pay all that was due him.

35. So shall my heavenly Father also do to each one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the region of Judaea beyond the Jordan;

2. And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

3. The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?

4. And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female,

5. And said, For this reason shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cling to his wife: and the two shall be one flesh?

6. Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let man not separate.

7. They said to him, Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?

8. He said to them, Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.

9. And I say to you, Whoever shall divorce his wife, except for unchastity, and shall marry another, commits adultery.

10. His disciples said to him, If this is the case of a man with his wife, it is good not to marry.

11. But he said to them, Not all men can receive this saying, only those to whom it is given.

12. For there are some eunuchs, who were born so, from their mothers' wombs: and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.

13. Then little children were brought to him, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: but the disciples rebuked them.

14. But Jesus said, Let the little children come to me, and do not forbid them: for to such as these belongs the kingdom of heaven.

15. And he laid his hands on them, and departed from there.

16. And, behold, one came and said to him, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

17. And he said to him, Why do you ask me what is good? there is no one good but One: but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.

18. He said to him, Which ones? Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,

19. Honour your father and your mother: and, You shall love your neighbour as yourself.

20. The young man said to him, All these things I have kept from my youth up: what do I still lack?

21. Jesus said to him, If you wish to be perfect, go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

22. But when the young man heard that, he went away sorrowful: for he had much property.

23. Then Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.

24. And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

25. When his disciples heard this, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?

26. But Jesus looked at them, and said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

27. Then Peter answered and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what then shall we have?

28. And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, At the renewal of all things, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of his glory, you who have followed me shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And every one who has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.

30. But many who are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

## Matthew 20

1. For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers to work in his vineyard.

2. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,

4. And said to them; Go also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.

5. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.

6. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing, and said to them, Why are you standing here idle all the day?

7. They said to him, Because no man has hired us. He said to them, Go also into the vineyard.

8. So when evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.

9. And when those who were hired about the eleventh hour came, every man received a denarius.

10. But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; but each of them likewise received a denarius.

11. And when they had received it, they grumbled against the landowner,

12. Saying, These last have worked but one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.

13. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do you no wrong: did you not agree with me for a denarius?

14. Take what is yours, and go your way: I wish to give to this last man, just as to you.

15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Is your eye envious, because I am good?

16. So the last shall be first, and the first last.

17. And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way said to them,

18. Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,

19. And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and on the third day he shall be raised up.

20. Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, bowing before him, and asked a certain thing of him.

21. And he said to her, What do you wish? She said to him, Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, the one on your right hand, and the other on the left, in your kingdom.

22. But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink? They said to him, We are able.

23. And he said to them, You shall indeed drink of my cup: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.

24. And when the ten heard this, they were moved with indignation against the two brothers.

25. But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them.

26. But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be great among you, let him be your servant;

27. And whoever will be chief among you, let him be your slave:

28. Even as the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.

29. And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.

30. And, behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David.

31. And the multitude rebuked them, telling them to be quiet: but they cried out all the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David.

32. And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What do you want that I should do for you?

33. They said to him, Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.

34. So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately they received their sight, and they followed him.

## Matthew 21

1. And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,

2. Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you shall find a donkey tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.

3. And if any man says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and immediately he will send them.

4. All this was done, that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled,

5. Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting upon a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

6. And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

7. And brought the donkey, and the colt, and placed on them their garments, and he sat upon them.

8. And a very great multitude spread their garments along the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and spread them on the way.

9. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed after, cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

10. And when he came into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?

11. And the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.

12. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold doves,

13. And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.

14. And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.

15. And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were very displeased,

16. And said to him, Do you hear what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouths of children and nursing infants you have brought perfect praise?

17. And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany; and he lodged there.

18. Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.

19. And when he saw a fig tree by the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves, and he said to it, Let no fruit grow on you ever again. And at once the fig tree withered away.

20. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree so quickly wither away?

21. Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and do not doubt, you shall not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be removed, and be cast into the sea; it shall be done.

22. And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.

23. And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you this authority?

24. And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

25. The baptism of John, where was it from? from heaven, or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?

26. But if we shall say, From men; we fear the people; for all hold that John was a prophet.

27. And they answered Jesus, and said, We do not know. And he said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.

28. But what do you think? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in the vineyard.

29. He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.

30. And he came to the second, and said the same. And he answered and said, I will, sir: but did not go.

31. Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That the tax gatherers and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you.

32. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him: but the tax gatherers and the prostitutes believed him: and even when you had seen this, you did not afterward repent and believe him.

33. Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner, who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went to a far country:

34. And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, that they might collect his fruit.

35. And the tenants took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

36. Again, he sent other servants, more than the first: and they did the same to them.

37. But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.

38. But when the tenants saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize his inheritance.

39. And they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

40. Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?

41. They said to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other tenants, who shall give him the fruits in their seasons.

42. Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the cornerstone: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

43. Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation which will bring forth its fruit.

44. And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

45. And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.

46. They sought to lay hands on him, but they feared the multitude, because they held him to be a prophet.

## Matthew 22

1. And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, and said,

2. The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who gave a marriage feast for his son,

3. And sent forth his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast: but they would not come.

4. Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fat calves have been killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.

5. But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his business:

6. And the rest took his servants, and treated them spitefully, and killed them.

7. The king was angry, and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.

8. Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.

9. Therefore, go into the highways, and as many as you shall find, invite to the marriage feast.

10. So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

11. And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment:

12. And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

13. Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

14. For many are called, but few are chosen.

15. Then the Pharisees went, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.

16. And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in truth, nor do you defer to any man: for you do not regard the position of men.

17. Therefore tell us, What do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?

18. But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you test me, you hypocrites?

19. Show me the money used for the tax. And they brought to him a denarius.

20. And he said to them, Whose image and inscription is this?

21. They said to him, Caesar's. Then he said to them, Then render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.

22. When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.

23. The same day the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him,

24. Teacher, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up children for his brother.

25. Now there were among us seven brothers: and the first, after he had married, died, and, having no children, left his wife to his brother:

26. The same happened to the second, and the third, down to the seventh.

27. And last of all the woman died.

28. Therefore, at the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.

29. Jesus answered them, You err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

30. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven.

31. And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God,

32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

33. And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

34. But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.

35. Then one of them, who was a lawyer, asked him a question to test him, saying,

36. Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?

37. Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.

38. This is the first and greatest commandment.

39. And the second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself.

40. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

41. While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

42. What do you think of the Christ? whose son is he? They said to him, The Son of David.

43. He said to them, How then does David in the spirit call him Lord, saying,

44. The LORD said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet?

45. If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?

46. And no man was able to answer him a word, nor did any man dare from that day forth to ask him any more questions.

## Matthew 23

1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitude, and to his disciples,

2. Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

3. Therefore, all they bid you to observe, that observe and do; but do not imitate their works: for they say, but do not do.

4. For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them upon men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.

5. But all their works they do to be seen by men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,

6. And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,

7. And greetings in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi.

8. But do not be called Rabbi: for one is your Teacher; and all of you are brethren.

9. And call no man upon the earth your father: for one is your Father, who is in heaven.

10. Neither be called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.

11. But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant.

12. And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and he who shall humble himself shall be exalted.

13. But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you do not go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.

14. [Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: therefore you shall receive the greater condemnation.]

15. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you cross sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.

16. Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!

17. You blind fools: which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?

18. And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is upon it, he is obligated.

19. You blind fools: which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?

20. Therefore, whoever shall swear by the altar, swears by it, and by all things on it.

21. And whoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it, and by him who dwells in it.

22. And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.

23. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, justice, mercy, and faithfulness: these you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.

24. You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel.

25. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.

26. You blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

27. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but within are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.

28. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

29. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous,

30. And say, If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

31. Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves, that you are the sons of those who killed the prophets.

32. Fill up, then, the measure of the sins of your fathers.

33. You serpents, you generation of vipers, how can you escape being condemned to hell?

34. Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them you shall scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:

35. That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berachiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.

36. Truly I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation.

37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets, and stone those who are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not let me!

38. Behold, your house is left to you desolate.

39. For I say to you, You shall not see me again, until you shall say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

## Matthew 24

1. And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.

2. And Jesus said to them, Do you not see all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

3. And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us when these things shall be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?

4. And Jesus answered them, Take heed that no man deceive you.

5. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall deceive many.

6. And you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that you are not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.

7. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and earthquakes, in various places.

8. All these are the beginning of birth pains.

9. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and you shall be hated by all nations for my name's sake.

10. And then shall many fall away, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.

11. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

12. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall grow cold.

13. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.

14. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world as a testimony to all nations; and then the end shall come.

15. Therefore, when you shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)

16. Then let those who are in Judaea flee into the mountains:

17. Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house:

18. Neither let him who is in the field turn back to take his cloak.

19. And woe to those who are with child, and to those who nurse in those days!

20. Pray that your flight may not be in the winter or on the sabbath day:

21. For then there shall be great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

22. And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved: but for the sake of the elect those days shall be cut short.

23. Then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or there; do not believe it.

24. For false Christs shall arise, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so as to deceive, if it were possible, even the very elect.

25. Behold, I have told you beforehand.

26. Therefore if they shall say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; do not go forth: behold, he is in the inner rooms; do not believe it.

27. For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

28. For wherever the body is, there will the vultures be gathered together.

29. Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give its light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

30. And then the sign of the Son of man shall appear in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

31. And he shall send out his angels with a great call of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

32. Now learn this parable from the fig tree; When its branch becomes tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:

33. So likewise, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.

34. Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, until all these things are fulfilled.

35. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

36. But of that day and hour no man knows, no, not the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but my Father only.

37. But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

38. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,

39. And they did not know until the flood came and took them all away; so shall the coming of the Son of man be.

40. Then shall two be in the field; one shall be taken, and the other left.

41. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one shall be taken, and the other left.

42. Therefore watch: for you do not know on what day your Lord will come.

43. But know this, that if the owner of the house had known at what time the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

44. Therefore you must also be ready: for the Son of man will come at an hour you do not expect.

45. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season?

46. Blessed is that servant, whom his lord shall find so doing when he comes.

47. Truly I say to you, That he shall put him in charge of all his goods.

48. But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming;

49. And shall begin to strike his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;

50. The lord of that servant shall come on a day when he does not expect him, and at a hour that he is not aware of,

51. And shall cut him apart, and assign him a place with the hypocrites: where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

## Matthew 25

1. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

2. And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.

3. Those who were foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them:

4. But the wise took oil in their flasks with their lamps.

5. While the bridegroom tarried, they all became drowsy and slept.

6. And at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go out to meet him.

7. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

8. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil; for our lamps are going out.

9. But the wise answered, saying, No; lest there not be enough for us and you: but rather go to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.

10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.

11. Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

12. But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.

13. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

14. For it is like a man travelling to a far country, who called his servants, and delivered to them his goods.

15. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his ability; and he went on his journey.

16. Then he who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and gained another five talents.

17. And likewise, he who had received two, gained two more.

18. But he who had received one went and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.

19. After a long time the lord of those servants came, and settled accounts with them.

20. And so he who had received five talents came and brought the other five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

21. His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter into the joy of your lord.

22. He also who had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents: behold, I have gained two more talents.

23. His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter into the joy of your lord.

24. Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed:

25. And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth: lo, here you have what is yours.

26. His lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed:

27. Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and then at my coming I should have received it back with interest.

28. Take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.

29. For to every one who has shall more be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away.

30. And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

31. When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

32. And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats:

33. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on the left.

34. Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

35. For I was hungry, and you gave me food: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:

36. Naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.

37. Then the righteous shall answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? or thirsty, and give you drink?

38. When did we see you a stranger, and take you in? or naked, and clothe you?

39. Or when did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?

40. And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, as you have done it to one of the least of these, my brethren, you have done it to me.

41. Then he shall say to those on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

42. For I was hungry, and you gave me no food: I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink:

43. I was a stranger, and you did not take me in: naked, and you did not clothe me: sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.

44. Then they also shall answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?

45. Then he shall answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.

46. And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.

## Matthew 26

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,

2. You know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.

3. Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled together at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,

4. And conspired to take Jesus by stealth, and kill him.

5. But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.

6. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he reclined at table.

8. But when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, To what purpose is this waste?

9. For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

10. But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? for she has done a good work for me.

11. For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have me.

12. When she poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.

13. Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told in memory of her.

14. Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,

15. And said to them, What will you give me if I deliver him to you? And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.

16. And from that time on he sought an opportunity to betray him.

17. Now on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the passover?

18. And he said, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.

19. And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they made ready the passover.

20. Now when the evening had come, he sat down with the twelve.

21. And as they ate, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.

22. And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and every one of them began to say to him, Lord, is it I?

23. And he answered and said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish shall betray me.

24. The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it would have been better for that man if he had not been born.

25. Then Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Teacher, is it I? He said to him, You have said it.

26. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

27. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you;

28. For this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.

29. But I say to you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom.

30. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.

31. Then Jesus said to them, This night all of you shall fall away because of me: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.

32. But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. Peter answered and said to him, Though all fall away because of you, yet I will never fall away.

34. Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this night, before the cock crows, you shall deny me thrice.

35. Peter said to him, Though I die with you, yet I will not deny you. And all the disciples said the same.

36. Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit here, while I go and pray over there.

37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very troubled.

38. Then he said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death: remain here, and watch with me.

39. And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.

40. And he came to the disciples, and found them asleep, and said to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one hour?

41. Watch and pray, that you do not enter into temptation: the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

42. He went away again, a second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this may not pass away from me, except I drink it, your will be done.

43. And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.

44. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.

45. Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

46. Rise, let us be going: behold, he who betrays me is at hand.

47. And while he yet spoke, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48. Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, he is the one: hold him fast.

49. And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.

50. And Jesus said to him, Friend, do that which you have come for. Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.

51. And, behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

52. Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back in its place: for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.

53. Do you think that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall at once give me more than twelve legions of angels?

54. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that say it must happen this way?

55. In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Do you come out to take me with swords and clubs, as if I was a thief ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hold on me.

56. But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

57. And those who had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

58. But Peter followed him from afar to the high priest's courtyard, and went in, and sat with the guards, to see the outcome.

59. Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

60. But found none, though many false witnesses came forth. At last two false witnesses came,

61. And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

62. And the high priest arose, and said to him, Do you have no answer? what is it which these men testify against you?

63. But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said to him, I charge you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.

64. Jesus said to him, You have said so: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

65. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.

66. What do you think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.

67. Then they spit in his face, and beat him; and others struck him with the palms of their hands,

68. Saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ, Who is it who struck you?

69. Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard: and a maid came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.

70. But he denied it before them all, saying, I know not what your are saying.

71. And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.

72. And again he denied it with an oath, I do not know the man.

73. And after a while the bystanders came to him, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech betrays you.

74. Then he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know the man. And immediately the cock crowed.

75. And Peter remembered the word Jesus said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. When the morning had come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

2. And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pilate, the governor.

3. Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

4. Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see to that yourself.

5. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.

6. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.

7. And they took counsel, and bought with the money the potter's field, to bury strangers in.

8. Therefore that field has been called, The field of blood, to this day.

9. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a value had been set by the sons of Israel;

10. And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.

11. And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say so.

12. And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he said nothing.

13. Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?

14. And he answered him not a word; so that the governor marvelled greatly.

15. Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they wanted.

16. And they had at that time a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.

17. Therefore, when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?

18. For he knew that it was because of envy they had delivered him up.

19. When he sat down on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

20. But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas, and have Jesus executed.

21. The governor answered them, Which of the two do you want me to release for you? They said, Barabbas.

22. Pilate said to them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said to him, Let him be crucified.

23. And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out all the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

24. When Pilate saw that he could not prevail, but rather that a tumult was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of this man's blood: you see to it yourselves.

25. Then all the people answered, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.

26. Then he released Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him over to be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered around him the whole cohort of soldiers.

28. And they stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.

29. And when they had weaved a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

30. And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head.

31. And after had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his own clothing on him, and led him away to crucify him.

32. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: they compelled him to bear his cross.

33. And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, place of a skull,

34. They gave him wine to drink mixed with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.

35. And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them by casting lots.

36. And sitting down they watched him there;

37. And set up over his head the accusation against him, which read, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. At that time there were two robbers crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.

39. And those who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

40. Saying, You who would destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.

41. Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,

42. He saved others; he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.

43. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

44. The robbers also, who were crucified with him, cast the same insult at him.

45. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

47. Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elijah.

48. And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.

49. The rest said, Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.

50. Jesus, when he had cried out again with a loud voice, yielded up the spirit.

51. And, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split;

52. And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who slept arose,

53. And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.

54. Now when the centurion, and those who were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

55. And many women were there, beholding from afar. They had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.

56. Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

57. When evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus.

58. He went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it be delivered to him.

59. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

60. And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone over the door of the tomb, and departed.

61. And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were there, sitting opposite the tomb.

62. Now the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together before Pilate,

63. Saying, Sir, we remember that while he was yet alive that deceiver said, After three days I will rise again.

64. Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead: so the last deception shall be worse than the first.

65. Pilate said to them, You have a guard: go your way; make it as secure as you can.

66. So they went, and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and posting a guard.

## Matthew 28

1. At the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.

2. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

3. His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow:

4. And for fear of him the guards shook, and became as dead men.

5. And the angel said to the women, Fear not: for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified.

6. He is not here: for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.

7. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you shall see him: lo, I have told you.

8. And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy; and ran to bring his disciples word.

9. And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.

10. Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid: go tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.

11. Now when they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.

12. And when they had assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money to the soldiers,

13. Saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.

14. And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him, and keep you out of trouble.

15. So they took the money, and did as they were told: and this story is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.

16. Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to a mountain where Jesus had directed them.

17. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

18. And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power has been given to me in heaven and on earth.

19. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:

20. Teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
