# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1. Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved fellow labourer,

2. And to our sister Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:

3. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,

5. Because I hear of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;

6. And I pray that the sharing of your faith may promote the knowledge of every good thing which is ours in Christ Jesus.

7. For we have great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.

8. Therefore, though I could be bold in Christ and order you that which is proper,

9. Yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you, I, Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

10. I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in these bonds:

11. Who in times past was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.

12. I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart,

13. Whom I would have kept with me, that in your place he might have ministered to me while I am in these bonds for the gospel:

14. But without your consent I did not want to do anything; that your benevolence should not be, as it were, of necessity, but willingly.

15. For perhaps he was parted from you for a while for this reason, that you should have him back forever;

16. No longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?

17. Therefore, if you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me.

18. If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, charge that to my account;

19. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it: to say nothing of how you owe to me even your own self as well.

20. Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.

21. Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.

22. At the same time prepare me a guest room: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.

23. Greetings to you from Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;

24. And from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow labourers.

25. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
