# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to further the faith of God's chosen and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,

2. Which rests in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the beginning of time;

3. And at the proper time he revealed his word through the preaching which was entrusted to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

4. To Titus, my own child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.

5. For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that remained, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you.

6. Elders must be blameless, the husband of one wife, whose children believe and are not accused of being profligate or unruly.

7. For an overseer must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for gain;

8. But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good, sensible, just, holy, self-controlled;

9. Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to refute those who oppose it.

10. For there are many unruly and empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision:

11. Whose mouths must be stopped, for they are subverting whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for sordid gain.

12. One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.

13. This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

14. Not giving heed to Jewish myths, and commandments of men who turn from the truth.

15. To the pure all things are pure: but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and consciences are defiled.

16. They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him; being detestable, and disobedient, and unfit for any good work.

## Titus 2

1. But as for you, speak the things which befit sound doctrine.

2. Urge the older men to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in steadfastness.

3. Urge the older women likewise, to be reverent in behaviour, not malicious gossips, not slaves to much wine, but teaching good things;

4. That they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,

5. To be sensible, chaste, workers at home, kind, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be maligned.

6. Likewise, urge the young men to be self-controlled.

7. In all things show yourself to be an example of good works, and in your teaching show purity, dignity,

8. And sound speech, which cannot be condemned; so that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.

9. Urge servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not to talk back,

10. Not to pilfer, but showing entire and true fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

11. For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,

12. Teaching us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires, and live sensibly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

13. Looking for the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;

14. Who gave himself up for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people of his own, zealous for good works.

15. Speak these things, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man disregard you.

## Titus 3

1. Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do every good work,

2. To speak evil of no man, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all courtesy to all men.

3. For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, slaves to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy; hated, and hating one another.

4. But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared,

5. He saved us, not because of works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing by the Holy Spirit;

6. Whom he poured out upon us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

7. That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs, having the hope of eternal life.

8. This is a faithful saying; and I want you to affirm these things constantly, that those who have believed in God might be careful to engage in good works. These things are good and profitable for men.

9. But avoid foolish controversies, and genealogies, and dissensions, and wrangling about the law; for they are unprofitable and futile.

10. Reject a man who is divisive after a first and second warning;

11. Knowing that such a man is perverted and sinful; condemned by himself.

12. When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis: for I have determined to winter there.

13. Be diligent to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.

14. And let our people learn to engage in honest employment, so they may meet urgent needs, and that they may not be unfruitful.

15. All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
