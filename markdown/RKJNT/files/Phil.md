# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:

2. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

4. Always, in every prayer of mine for you all, I make my requests with joy,

5. Because of your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;

6. Being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.

7. It is right for me to think this way of you all, because I have you in my heart; since both in my imprisonment, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partakers with me of grace.

8. For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.

9. And this I pray, that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and in all discernment;

10. That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ;

11. Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are from Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

12. But I would have you understand, brethren, that the things which happened to me have really served to advance the gospel;

13. So that my imprisonment in Christ has become known throughout the entire praetorian guard, and to all the others;

14. And many of the brethren, growing confident in the Lord because of my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

15. Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry; and some also from good will;

16. The later out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defence of the gospel:

17. The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my imprisonment

18. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

19. For I know that this shall turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

20. According to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but that with all boldness, now as always, Christ shall be exalted in my body, whether by life, or by death.

21. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

22. But if I live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me: yet what I shall choose I do not know.

23. For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:

24. Nevertheless, to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.

25. And having this confidence, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith;

26. That in me your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ, through my coming to you again.

27. Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or am absent, I may hear of you, that you are standing fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

28. And in no way terrified by your adversaries: which is to them a sign of their destruction, but to you of your salvation, and that from God.

29. For to you it is granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake;

30. Having the same conflict which you saw to be mine, and now hear to be mine still.

## Philippians 2

1. If, therefore, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation in love, if any fellowship in the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,

2. Fulfill my joy by being likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord and of one mind.

3. Let nothing be done through selfishness or vain conceit; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the others as better than himself.

4. Let each of you not only look to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.

5. Let this attitude be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

6. Who, though being in the form of God, did not regard equality with God something to be grasped:

7. But made himself of no reputation, and took upon himself the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

8. And being found in form as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.

9. Therefore, God has highly exalted him, and given him the name which is above every name:

10. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;

11. And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

12. Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only in my presence, but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

13. For it is God who works in you both to will and to do his good pleasure.

14. Do all things without grumbling and disputing:

15. That you may be blameless and innocent, the children of God, without blemish, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;

16. Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.

17. Even if I am poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad, and rejoice with you all.

18. In the same way, you also should be glad, and rejoice with me.

19. But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I may also be of good cheer, when I receive news from you.

20. For I have no man like him, of so kindred a spirit, who will genuinely care for your welfare.

21. For all seek after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ's.

22. But you know he has proven himself, that, as a son with his father, he has served with me in the gospel.

23. Therefore, I hope to send him presently, as soon as I shall see how it will go with me.

24. And I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.

25. Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my needs.

26. For he longed after you all, and was full of distress, because you had heard that he had been sick.

27. Indeed he was sick, and near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but also on me, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

28. Therefore, I sent him the more eagerly, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.

29. Therefore, receive him in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such men in high regard:

30. Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to complete the service you could not give.

## Philippians 3

1. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is no trouble, and is a safeguard for you.

2. Beware of the dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilators of the flesh.

3. For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh,

4. Though I myself might have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has reason to trust in the flesh, I have more:

5. Circumcised the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; regarding the law, a Pharisee;

6. Concerning zeal, a persecutor of the church; regarding the righteousness which is of the law, blameless.

7. But whatever things were gain to me, those I have counted as loss for Christ.

8. Furthermore, I count all things as loss compared to the excellency of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may win Christ,

9. And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, based on the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:

10. That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death;

11. If only I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.

12. Not that I have already attained it, or have already become perfect: but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus laid hold of me.

13. Brethren, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of it yet: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are ahead,

14. I press on toward the goal for the prize, to which God has called me upward in Christ Jesus.

15. Therefore, let us, as many as are mature, be of this mind: and if in anything you are of a different mind, God shall also reveal this to you.

16. Only let us hold true to that which we have already attained.

17. Brethren, join together in following me, and note those who walk according to our example.

18. For many, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even with weeping, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ:

19. Whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.

20. But our citizenship is in heaven; from whence we eagerly look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

21. Who shall change our lowly body, that it may be fashioned like his glorious body, by the power which enables him even to subject all things to himself.

## Philippians 4

1. Therefore, my brethren, whom I dearly love and long for, my joy and crown, in this way stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.

2. I urge Euodia, and urge Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.

3. And I ask you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they have laboured with me in the gospel, together with Clement, and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life.

4. Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.

5. Let your forbearing spirit be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.

6. Be anxious about nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.

7. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

8. Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are admirable; if there is any virtue, and if there is anything worthy of praise, think on these things.

9. Those things, which you have learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

10. But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your care for me; indeed, you did care, but you lacked opportunity.

11. Not that I speak from want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.

12. I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound: in all circumstances I have learned how to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

13. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

14. Nevertheless, you have done well to share in my affliction.

15. Now you Philippians also know, that at the beginning of the gospel ministry, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in giving and receiving, but you alone.

16. For even in Thessalonica you more than once sent help to provide for my needs.

17. Not because I desire a gift: but I desire the fruit that increases to your credit.

18. But I have received all, and abound: I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God.

19. And my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

20. Now to our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

21. Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.

22. All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household.

23. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
