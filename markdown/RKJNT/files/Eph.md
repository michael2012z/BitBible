# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:

2. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places:

4. Just as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him. In love

5. He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to his good pleasure and will,

6. To the praise of his glorious grace, which he freely bestowed upon us in the beloved.

7. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

8. Which he has lavished upon us in all wisdom and prudence;

9. Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he set forth in him:

10. That in the fulness of time he might gather all things together under Christ, both things which are in heaven, and things which are on earth. In him

11. We have also obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:

12. That we who first trusted in Christ should live for the praise of his glory.

13. In him you also, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: having also believed, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,

14. Who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession, to the praise of his glory.

15. Therefore, I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love for all the saints,

16. Do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;

17. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:

18. That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened; so you may know what is the hope of his calling, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,

19. And what is the incomparable greatness of his power toward us who believe. It is the working of his mighty power,

20. Which he exerted in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

21. Far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.

22. And he has put all things under his feet, and has appointed him to be the head over all things for the church,

23. Which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all things everywhere.

## Ephesians 2

1. And you were dead in trespasses and sins;

2. In which you walked in times past, according to the ways of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience.

3. Among them we all lived in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, like the others.

4. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,

5. Even when we were dead in transgressions, has made us alive together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)

6. And has raised us up with him, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

7. That in the ages to come he might show the incomparable riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

8. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9. Not because of works, lest any man should boast.

10. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has prepared beforehand for us to do.

11. Therefore remember, that in times past you Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by those who are called the Circumcision, (that which is performed in the flesh by hands;)

12. That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

13. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

14. For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the wall of hostility between us;

15. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, the law of commandments and ordinances; to create in himself one new man in place of two, thus making peace;

16. And that he might reconcile both to God, in one body, through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity.

17. And he came and preached peace to you who were far off, and to those who were near.

18. For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.

19. Now then, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of the household of God;

20. Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the cornerstone;

21. In whom the whole building is joined together and grows to become a holy temple in the Lord:

22. In whom you also are built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.

## Ephesians 3

1. For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles,

2. If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you:

3. That by revelation he made known to me the mystery; as I wrote before briefly.

4. When you read this, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,

5. Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;

6. That is, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers together of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel:

7. Of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the working of his power.

8. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, was this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

9. And make all men see what is the plan of the mystery, which from past ages has been hidden in God, who created all things:

10. That now, to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places, the manifold wisdom of God might be known through the church,

11. According to the eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord:

12. In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith in him.

13. Therefore I ask that you not be discouraged at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.

14. For this reason I bow my knees to the Father,

15. From whom every family in heaven and earth is named,

16. That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,

18. May be able to comprehend, with all the saints, its breadth, and length, and height, and depth;

19. And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fulness of God.

20. Now to him who is able to do immeasurably beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,

21. To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.

## Ephesians 4

1. Therefore I, a prisoner of the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called,

2. With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love;

3. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

4. There is one body, and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope in your calling;

5. One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

6. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all.

7. But to every one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

8. Therefore it says, When he ascended on high, he led a host of captives, and gave gifts to men.

9. (In saying that he ascended, what does that mean but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?

10. He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)

11. And he gave some as apostles; and some as prophets; and some as evangelists; and some as pastors and teachers;

12. For the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ:

13. Until we all attain the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

14. That we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming.

15. But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all things into him, who is the head, that is, Christ:

16. From whom the whole body, fitted and joined together by that which every joint supplies, according to the proper working of every part, causes the body to grow, for the building up of itself in love.

17. This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as other Gentiles walk, in the futility of their minds,

18. Having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts:

19. Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to licentiousness, greedy to practice all kinds of uncleanness.

20. But you did not learn Christ that way;

21. If indeed you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus,

22. Then put off the old man, which belongs to your former life, which is corrupt through deceitful lusts;

23. And be renewed in the spirit of your minds;

24. And put on the new man, who, in the likeness of God, is created in true righteousness and holiness.

25. Therefore, putting away lying, let every man speak the truth with his neighbour: for we are members of one another.

26. Be angry, and do not sin: do not let the sun go down upon your wrath:

27. Give no opportunity to the devil.

28. Let him who stole, steal no more: but rather let him labour, doing with his hands that which is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.

29. Let no corrupt words proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for edifying, that it may impart grace to the hearers.

30. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption.

31. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and quarreling, and slander, be put away from you, along with all types of malice:

32. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ has forgiven you.

## Ephesians 5

1. Therefore be imitators of God, as dear children;

2. And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice, a sweet smelling aroma to God.

3. But sexual immorality, and all impurity, or covetousness, must not even be named among you, as is befitting saints;

4. Nor let there be filthiness, or foolish talk, or coarse jesting, which are not proper: but rather giving of thanks.

5. For this you know: that no sexually immoral or impure person, or covetous man, (for such a man is an idolater,) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

6. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

7. Therefore, do not be partakers with them.

8. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord: walk as children of light;

9. (For the fruit of the Spirit consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)

10. And try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.

11. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,

12. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done by the disobedient in secret.

13. But all things that are exposed by the light become visible: for everything that is made visible is light.

14. Therefore he says, Awaken, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.

15. See then that you walk carefully, not as fools, but as wise men,

16. Making the most of the time, because the days are evil.

17. Therefore, do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

18. And do not be drunk with wine, which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit;

19. Speaking to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

20. Always giving thanks for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

21. Submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.

22. Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord.

23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, his body: and he himself is its saviour.

24. Therefore, as the church is subject to Christ, so let wives be to their own husbands in everything.

25. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church, and gave himself up for her;

26. That he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water through the word,

27. That he might present her to himself a glorious church, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that she should be holy and without blemish.

28. So husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.

29. For no man ever hated his own flesh; but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church:

30. Because we are members of his body.

31. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.

32. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

33. Nevertheless, let every one of you love his wife as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.

## Ephesians 6

1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

2. Honour your father and mother; (which is the first commandment with a promise;)

3. That it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.

4. And you fathers, do not provoke your children to anger: but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

5. Slaves, be obedient to those who are your earthly masters, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ;

6. Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

7. Doing service with a good will, as to the Lord, and not to men:

8. Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, he shall receive the same back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.

9. And, you masters, do the same to them, and give up threatening: knowing that both your Master and theirs is in heaven; and there is no partiality with him.

10. Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.

11. Put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

12. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against authorities, against the powers of darkness of this world, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.

13. Therefore, take up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand on the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

14. Stand therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;

15. And your feet shod with the readiness that is from the gospel of peace.

16. In addition to all these, take up the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.

17. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

18. Praying always in the Spirit with all manner of prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert in it with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints;

19. And for me, that words may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

20. For which I am an ambassador in chains: that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

21. Now, that you may also know my affairs, and how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make all these things known to you.

22. I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

23. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

24. Grace be to all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
