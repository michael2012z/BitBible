# Colossians

## Colossians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,

2. To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father.

3. We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

4. Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have for all the saints,

5. Because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you have already heard in the word of truth, the gospel;

6. Which has come to you. In all the world it brings forth fruit and grows, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and understood the grace of God in truth:

7. As you learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf;

8. Who has also declared to us your love in the Spirit.

9. For this reason, since the day we heard it, we do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

10. That you might walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please him in all things, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

11. Strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, with all endurance and patience with joyfulness;

12. Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us qualified to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.

13. He has delivered us from the dominion of darkness, and has transferred us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

14. In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

15. He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation:

16. For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities: all things were created by him, and for him:

17. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

18. He is also the head of the body, the church: he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have preeminence.

19. For it pleased the Father, that all his fulness should dwell in him;

20. And through him to reconcile all things to himself, whether things on earth, or things in heaven; having made peace through the blood of his cross.

21. And you who were at one time alienated and enemies in your minds because of wicked deeds,

22. He has now reconciled in his body of flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable in his sight:

23. If you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven; and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.

24. Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh that which is lacking in the afflictions of Christ for his body's sake, which is the church:

25. Of which I was made a minister, according to the commission of God, which was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known;

26. That is, the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints;

27. To whom God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the riches of the glory of this mystery; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

28. Him we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

29. For this I labour, striving according to his power, which works mightily within me.

## Colossians 2

1. For I want you to know what a great struggle I have for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;

2. That their hearts might be comforted as they are knit together in love, and that they might gain all the riches of the full assurance that comes from understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, of Christ;

3. In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

4. And this I say, lest any man should deceive you with enticing words.

5. For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your good order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.

6. Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him:

7. Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, and abounding with thanksgiving.

8. Beware, lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, which depend on the traditions of men and the rudiments of the world, and not on Christ.

9. For in him all the fulness of Deity dwells in bodily form.

10. And you are complete in him, who is the head of all rule and authority.

11. In him also you were circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

12. Having been buried with him in baptism, you have also risen with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.

13. And you, being dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has made alive together with him, having forgiven us all transgressions;

14. Cancelling the bond of debt, with its legal decrees against us, which was contrary to us, and taking it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

15. And having disarmed rulers and authorities, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

16. Therefore, let no man judge you in matters of food, or drink, or regarding a festival, or a new moon, or a sabbath day:

17. Which are a shadow of things to come; but the reality belongs to Christ.

18. Let no man defraud you of your reward, delighting in self-abasement and the worship of angels, taking his stand on visions, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

19. And not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

20. Therefore, if you are dead with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as though still living in the world, do you submit to such ordinances as,

21. Do not touch; do not taste; do not handle?

22. These all refer to things which perish with use; and are based on the commandments and doctrines of men.

23. These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship, and self-abasement, and severity to the body; but are of no value in restraining the indulgence of the flesh.

## Colossians 3

1. If you have been raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.

2. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

3. For you are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

4. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then you shall also appear with him in glory.

5. Therefore, put to death what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.

6. For because of these things the wrath of God is coming:

7. And in them you also walked at one time, when you lived in them.

8. But now put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy speech from your mouth.

9. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;

10. And have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of the one who created him.

11. Here there is neither Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free: but Christ is all, and in all.

12. Therefore, as the chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on hearts of mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience;

13. Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another. If any man has a complaint against another; just as Christ forgave you, so you do the same.

14. And above all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.

15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to this; and be thankful.

16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.

17. And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

18. Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

19. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh toward them.

20. Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.

21. Fathers, provoke not your children, lest they be discouraged.

22. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in all things; not as an outward show, as pleasers of men; but with singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:

23. And whatever you do, do it heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men;

24. Knowing that from the Lord you shall receive your reward, the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.

25. But he who does wrong shall be repaid for the wrong which he has done: and there is no partiality.

## Colossians 4

1. Masters, give to your slaves that which is just and fair; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.

2. Continue in prayer, and be watchful in it with thanksgiving;

3. And pray also for us, that God would open for us a door for the word, that we may speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am in prison:

4. That I may make it clear, as I should.

5. Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, making the most of the time.

6. Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.

7. All my affairs Tychicus shall declare to you; he is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.

8. I have sent him to you for that very purpose, that you might know of our circumstances, and that he might encourage your hearts.

9. With him is Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known to you all things which have taken place here.

10. Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, (regarding him you received instructions: that if he comes to you, welcome him;)

11. And Jesus, who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision, and they have been a comfort to me.

12. Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, greets you, always labouring fervently for you in prayer, that you may stand firm and fully assured in all the will of God.

13. For I bear him witness, that he has a great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.

14. Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

15. Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nympha, and the church which is in her house.

16. And when this letter is read among you, have it also read to the church of the Laodiceans; and you, likewise, read the letter from Laodicea.

17. And say to Archippus, Take heed that you fulfill the ministry which you have received in the Lord.

18. I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
