# Galatians

## Galatians 1

1. Paul, an apostle, (not sent from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

2. And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:

3. Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,

4. Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:

5. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

6. I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ, for another gospel:

7. Which is not truly another; but there are some who trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

8. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be eternally accursed.

9. As we said before, so now I say again, If any man preach any other gospel to you than that which you have received, let him be eternally accursed.

10. Do I now seek the favour of men, or of God? or do I seek to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.

11. But I want you to know, brethren, that the gospel which I preached is not from man.

12. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came by revelation from Jesus Christ.

13. For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and tried to destroy it:

14. And advanced in Judaism beyond many Jews of my age, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

15. But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,

16. To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood:

17. Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.

18. Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.

19. But of the other apostles I saw none, except James, the Lord's brother.

20. (Now these things which I am writing to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.)

21. Afterwards I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

22. And was still unknown by face to the churches of Christ in Judaea:

23. But they had only heard, That he who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.

24. And they glorified God because of me.

## Galatians 2

1. Then, fourteen years later, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

2. I went up because of a revelation, and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.

3. But not even Titus, who was with me, though a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.

4. That arose because of false brethren who secretly slipped in to spy out the liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.

5. We did not yield in subjection to them, not even for a hour; that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.

6. But those who seemed to be important, (what they were makes no difference to me: God shows no partiality:) well, those who seemed to be important added nothing to me:

7. But instead, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised;

8. (For he who worked effectively in Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised, also worked in me for the Gentiles:)

9. And when James, Cephas, and John, who were reputed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship; that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.

10. They only asked that we would remember the poor; the very thing which I also was eager to do.

11. But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.

12. For before certain men came from James, he ate with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.

13. And the other Jews joined him in insincerity; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their insincerity.

14. But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews?

15. We who are Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,

16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

17. But if, while seeking to be justified by Christ, we ourselves are also shown to be sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? God forbid.

18. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.

19. For through the law I am dead to the law, that I might live to God.

20. I have been crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

21. I do not nullify the grace of God: for if righteousness comes by the law, then Christ died in vain.

## Galatians 3

1. O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been publicly portrayed as crucified?

2. This one thing I would learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?

3. Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?

4. Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it really was in vain.

5. He who provides to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?

6. Thus Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.

7. Therefore, understand that those who are of faith are the children of Abraham.

8. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.

9. So then, those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the man of faith.

10. For all who depend on the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do all things which are written in the book of the law.

11. But it is evident that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, for: The just shall live by faith.

12. But the law does not rest on faith: rather, The man who does these things shall live by them.

13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree.

14. He redeemed us so that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

15. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it is ratified, no man annuls or adds to it.

16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He does not say, And to seeds, as to many; but to one, And to your seed, which is Christ.

17. And this is what I mean, that the law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant which was previously ratified by God, and thus make the promise void.

18. For if the inheritance is based on the law, then it is no longer based on a promise: but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.

19. Then what purpose does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made. It was ordained by angels through the hand of a mediator.

20. Now a mediator is not for one party only, but God is one.

21. Is the law then against the promises of God? Absolutely not: for if there had been a law given which could impart life, then righteousness truly would have been through the law.

22. But the scripture has declared all to be prisoners of sin, so that the promise, given on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.

23. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up until faith should be revealed.

24. Therefore, the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

25. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.

26. For you are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

29. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

## Galatians 4

1. Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a servant, though he is owner of all;

2. But is under guardians and trustees until the time appointed by the father.

3. So we, when we were children, were in bondage to the elementary principles of the world:

4. But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

5. To redeem those who were under the law, that we might be adopted as sons.

6. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

7. Therefore, you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.

8. But previously, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.

9. But now that you have come to know God, or rather, to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to those weak and beggarly principles, to which you again desire to be in bondage?

10. You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.

11. I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.

12. Brethren, I urge you, be as I am; for I became as you are: you have not injured me at all.

13. You know it was because of infirmity of the flesh that I first preached the gospel to you.

14. And though my fleshly condition was a trial for you, you did not despise or reject me; but received me as an angel from God, as Christ Jesus himself.

15. Where then is the blessed joy you had? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

16. Have I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

17. They zealously seek you, but not for good; they would alienate you, that you might seek them.

18. But it is always good to be zealously sought after in a good way, and not only when I am present with you.

19. My little children, with whom I again suffer birth pains until Christ is formed in you,

20. I desire to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.

21. Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?

22. For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman, the other by a free woman.

23. He who was born by the slave woman was born according to the flesh; but the son born by the free woman was through the promise.

24. These things are an allegory: for these women are the two covenants; the one from mount Sinai, who bears children into bondage; this is Hagar.

25. For this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children.

26. But the Jerusalem which is above is free, and she is our mother.

27. For it is written, Rejoice, you who are barren and bear no children; break forth and shout, you who are not in the pangs of birth: for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband.

28. Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are the children of promise.

29. But as it was then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.

30. Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? Cast out the slave woman and her son: for the son of the slave woman shall not be an heir with the son of the free woman.

31. So then, brethren, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.

## Galatians 5

1. It is for liberty that Christ has made us free. Therefore, stand fast and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.

2. Behold, I, Paul say to you, that if you are circumcised, Christ shall be of no value to you.

3. For I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is obliged to obey the whole law.

4. You who would be justified by the law, you have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace.

5. For we through the Spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of righteousness.

6. For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; but faith which works through love.

7. You ran well; who hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?

8. This persuasion does not come from him who calls you.

9. A little leaven leavens the whole lump.

10. I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will take no other view: but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.

11. And if I, brethren, still preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.

12. I wish those who trouble you would even emasculate themselves.

13. For, brethren, you have been called to liberty; only do not use your liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but in love serve one another.

14. For all the law is fulfilled in one command; You shall love your neighbour as yourself.

15. But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another.

16. This I say, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the desires of the flesh.

17. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are in conflict with one another: so that you cannot do the things that you wish.

18. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

19. Now the works of the flesh are obvious; they are; sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness,

20. Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strife, jealousy, fits of rage, selfishness, dissensions, factions,

21. Envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like: of which I forewarn you, as I have also warned you in the past, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

23. Gentleness, self-control: against such things there is no law.

24. And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

25. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.

26. Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying one another.

## Galatians 6

1. Brethren, if a man is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual, restore him in the spirit of gentleness; considering yourselves, lest you also be tempted.

2. Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

3. For if a man thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

4. But let every man test his own work, and then he can take pride in himself, and not in comparison to another.

5. For every man shall bear his own burden.

6. Let him who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches.

7. Do not be deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.

8. For he who sows to his flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap eternal life.

9. And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we do not loose heart.

10. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to those who are of the household of faith.

11. See what large letters I make as I write to you with my own hand.

12. Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh would compel you to be circumcised; but only to avoid suffering persecution for the cross of Christ.

13. For not even those who are circumcised keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

14. But God forbid that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.

15. For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only a new creation.

16. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

17. Henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear on my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

18. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
