# John

## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2. He was in the beginning with God.

3. All things were made by him; and without him was nothing made that was made.

4. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

5. And the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness has not comprehended it.

6. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

7. He came as a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

8. He was not the Light, but was sent to bear witness to the Light.

9. The true Light, which enlightens every man, was coming into the world.

10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world did not know him.

11. He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.

12. But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become the children of God, even to those who believe in his name:

13. Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

14. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father,) full of grace and truth.

15. John bore witness to him, and cried out, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He who comes after me ranks above me: for he was before me.

16. And of his fulness we have all received, and grace upon grace.

17. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

18. No man has seen God at any time; but God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.

19. And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?

20. And he confessed, and did not deny; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

21. And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered, No.

22. Then they said to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?

23. He said, I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.

24. Now they had been sent by the Pharisees.

25. And they asked him, Why do you baptize then, if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet?

26. John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but one stands among you, whom you do not know;

27. It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.

28. These things took place in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29. The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.

30. This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks above me: for he was before me.

31. And I did not know him: but I came baptizing with water that he might be revealed to Israel.

32. And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained upon him.

33. And I did not know him: but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.

34. And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.

35. Again the next day John stood with two of his disciples;

36. And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!

37. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

38. Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What do you seek? They said to him, Rabbi, (which translated means Teacher,) where are you staying?

39. He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he was staying, and remained with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.

40. One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

41. He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah, which translated means Christ.

42. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him, he said, You are Simon the son of John: you shall be called Cephas, which translated means, Peter.

43. The day following Jesus decided to go forth into Galilee; and he found Philip, and said to him, Follow me.

44. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote about, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

46. And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

48. Nathanael said to him, How do you know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.

49. Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.

50. Jesus answered him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? you shall see greater things than these.

51. And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

## John 2

1. On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:

2. And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.

3. And when the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.

4. Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour has not yet come.

5. His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it.

6. Now there were six waterpots of stone set there, for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece.

7. Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

8. And he said to them, Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast. So they took it.

9. When the steward of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from: (but the servants who drew the water knew;) the steward of the feast called the bridegroom,

10. And said to him, Every man serves the good wine at the beginning; and when men have drunk freely, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.

11. This, the beginning of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and they stayed there not many days.

13. And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,

14. And found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting there:

15. And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep, and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overturned their tables;

16. And said to those who sold doves, Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of merchandise.

17. And his disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will consume me.

18. Then the Jews answered and said to him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?

19. Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

20. Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?

21. But he spoke of the temple of his body.

22. Therefore, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.

23. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, when they saw the miraculous signs which he did.

24. But Jesus did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all men,

25. And needed no one to testify about man: for he himself knew what was in man.

## John 3

1. There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:

2. He came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do the miraculous signs that you do, unless God is with him.

3. Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

4. Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

5. Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

7. Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.

8. The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.

9. Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?

10. Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?

11. Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what we know, and testify of what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony.

12. If I have told you earthly things, and you do not believe, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?

13. No man has ascended to heaven, but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man.

14. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up:

15. That whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

17. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world might be saved through him.

18. He who believes in him is not condemned: but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19. And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

20. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.

21. But he who practices the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be shown to have been done through God.

22. After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea; and there he remained with them, and baptized.

23. And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there: and people came, and were baptized.

24. For John had not yet been cast into prison.

25. Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and a Jew about purifying.

26. And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, he is baptizing, and all men are going to him.

27. John answered, A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given to him from heaven.

28. You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I have been sent before him.

29. He who has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.

30. He must increase, but I must decrease.

31. He who comes from above is above all: he who is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he who comes from heaven is above all.

32. And what he has seen and heard, to that he testifies; yet no man receives his testimony.

33. He who has received his testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.

34. For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives the Spirit without measure.

35. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.

36. He who believes in the Son has eternal life: but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God rests upon him.

## John 4

1. Therefore, when the Lord learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,

2. (Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)

3. He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.

4. And he had to go through Samaria.

5. Then he came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied from his journey, sat by the well: and it was about the sixth hour.

7. There came a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me a drink.

8. (For his disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.)

9. Then the woman of Samaria said to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

10. Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give me a drink; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.

11. The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where do you get that living water?

12. Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his children, and his cattle?

13. Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:

14. But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life.

15. The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.

16. Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.

17. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband:

18. For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that you spoke truly.

19. The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.

20. Our fathers worshipped on this mountain; but you say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

21. Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes when you shall worship the Father neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.

22. You do not know what you worship: we know what we worship: for salvation is from the Jews.

23. But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.

24. God is Spirit: and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

25. The woman said to him, I know that Messiah comes, who is called Christ: when he comes, he will tell us all things.

26. Jesus said to her, I who speak to you am he.

27. And at this moment his disciples came, and marvelled that he was speaking with a woman: yet no one said, What do you seek? or, Why are you talking with her?

28. Then the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city, and said to the people,

29. Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did: is this not the Christ?

30. Then they went out of the city, and came to him.

31. In the meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, Rabbi, eat.

32. But he said to them, I have food to eat of which you know nothing.

33. Therefore the disciples said to one another, Has any man brought him food?

34. Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.

35. Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are already white for harvest.

36. And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal: that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.

37. And here the saying holds true, One sows, and another reaps.

38. I sent you to reap that upon which you bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and you have entered into their labours.

39. And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him because of the words of the woman's testimony, He told me all that I ever did.

40. So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them: and he stayed there two days.

41. And many more believed because of his own word;

42. And they said to the woman, Now we believe, no longer because of your words: for now we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

43. Now after two days he departed from there, and went into Galilee.

44. For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.

45. When he came to Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.

46. So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick at Capernaum.

47. When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.

48. Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.

49. The royal official said to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.

50. Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.

51. And as he was going down, his servants met him, and told him, Your son lives.

52. Then he enquired of them the hour when he began to mend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

53. Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and he believed, and his whole household.

54. This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did after he came out of Judaea into Galilee.

## John 5

1. After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2. Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, and which has five porches.

3. On these lay a great multitude of disabled, blind, lame, and paralysed people, [waiting for the moving of the water.

4. For an angel went down at certain seasons into the pool, and stirred up the water: whoever then first stepped into the water after the stirring up was cured of whatever disease he had.]

5. And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years.

6. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been a long time in that condition, he said to him, Do you want to be made well?

7. The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.

8. Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat, and walk.

9. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his mat, and walked: Now that day was the sabbath.

10. The Jews therefore said to the man who was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.

11. He answered them, He who made me well said to me, Take up your mat, and walk.

12. Then they asked him, What man is it who said to you, Take up your mat, and walk?

13. But the man who was healed did not know who it was: for Jesus had quietly withdrawn while there was a crowd in that place.

14. Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you have been made well: sin no more, lest something worse come upon you.

15. The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.

16. And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

17. But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work.

18. Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.

19. Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but only what he sees the Father doing: for whatever things he does, these things the Son does likewise.

20. For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he is doing: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.

21. For as the Father raises up the dead, and gives them life; even so the Son gives life to whom he will.

22. For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:

23. That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who has sent him.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and shall not come into judgment; but has passed from death into life.

25. Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and those who hear shall live.

26. For as the Father has life in himself; so he has granted to the Son to have life in himself;

27. And has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.

28. Do not marvel at this: for the hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice,

29. And shall come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.

30. I can do nothing by myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.

31. If I bear witness to myself, my witness is not true.

32. There is another who bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he bears of me is true.

33. You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.

34. Not that the testimony I receive is from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.

35. He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.

36. But I have a greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the very works that I do, these bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.

37. And the Father himself, who has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.

38. And you do not have his word abiding in you: for you do not believe him whom he has sent.

39. You search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and it is they that testify of me.

40. Yet you will not come to me, that you might have life.

41. I do not receive honour from men.

42. But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.

43. I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.

44. How can you believe, when you receive honour from one another, and do not seek the honour that comes from him who alone is God?

45. Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.

46. For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me: for he wrote of me.

47. But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe my words?

## John 6

1. After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, that is, the sea of Tiberias.

2. And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miraculous signs which he performed on those who were diseased.

3. And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.

4. And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.

5. When Jesus lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company coming to him, he said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?

6. And this he said to test him: for he knew what he would do.

7. Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii of bread is not sufficient for every one of them to have a little.

8. One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,

9. There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fish: but what are they among so many?

10. And Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.

11. And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to those who were seated; and he did likewise with the fish, as much as they wanted.

12. When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing may be lost.

13. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.

14. Then those men, when they had seen the miraculous sign that Jesus did, said, This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world.

15. When Jesus perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again to the mountain by himself.

16. And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,

17. And entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.

18. And the sea arose because of a great wind that blew.

19. So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat: and they were afraid.

20. But he said to them, It is I; do not be afraid.

21. Then they gladly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.

22. The day following, the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone.

23. But now some other boats came from Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks.

24. When the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.

25. And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come here?

26. Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miraculous signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.

27. Do not labour for the food which perishes, but for that food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for on him has God the Father set his seal.

28. Then they said to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?

29. Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.

30. Therefore they said to him, What sign do you show then, that we may see, and believe you? what work do you perform?

31. Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.

32. Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.

33. For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.

34. Then they said to him, Lord, give us this bread always.

35. And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he who comes to me shall never hunger; and he who believes in me shall never thirst.

36. But I said to you, That you have seen me, and do not believe.

37. All those whom the Father gives me shall come to me; and he who comes to me I will by no means cast out.

38. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.

39. And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up on the last day.

40. And this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes in him, may have eternal life: and I will raise him up on the last day.

41. Then the Jews murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.

42. And they said, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he now says, I came down from heaven?

43. Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.

44. No man can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him: and I will raise him up on the last day.

45. It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Therefore, every man who has heard, and has learned from the Father, comes to me.

46. Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.

47. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes has eternal life.

48. I am the bread of life.

49. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

50. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.

51. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

52. The Jews then argued among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

53. Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.

54. Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.

55. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

56. He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.

57. As the living Father sent me, and I live by the Father: so he who eats me shall live because of me.

58. This is the bread which came down from heaven: not as the fathers ate manna, and died: he who eats this bread shall live forever.

59. These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

60. Many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?

61. But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Does this offend you?

62. What then if you should see the Son of man ascend to where he was before?

63. The spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing: the words I speak to you are spirit and life.

64. But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe, and who would betray him.

65. And he said, Therefore I said to you, that no one can come to me, unless it is granted to him by the Father.

66. From that time many of his disciples drew back, and no longer walked with him.

67. Then Jesus said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away?

68. Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life.

69. And we believe and have come to know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

70. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?

71. He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for it was he, one of the twelve, who would betray him.

## John 7

1. After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.

2. Now the Jewish feast of tabernacles was at hand.

3. His brothers said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judaea, that your disciples may also see the works that you do.

4. For there is no man who does anything in secret, if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.

5. For his brothers did not believe in him either.

6. Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come: but your time is always here.

7. The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.

8. You go up to this feast: I am not going up to this feast; for my time has not yet fully come.

9. When he had said these words to them, he remained in Galilee.

10. But when his brothers had gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

11. Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?

12. And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; he deceives the people.

13. Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.

14. Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.

15. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How has this man become learned, having never studied?

16. Jesus answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.

17. If any man is willing to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.

18. He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory: but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

19. Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?

20. The people answered and said, You have a devil: who seeks to kill you?

21. Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.

22. Moses gave you circumcision; (though it is not from Moses, but from the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.

23. If a man may receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made an entire man well on the sabbath day?

24. Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteously.

25. Then some people of Jerusalem said, Is this not the man whom they seek to kill?

26. But, lo, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers really know that this is the Christ?

27. Yet we know where this man is from: but when the Christ comes, no man will know where he is from.

28. Then Jesus cried out in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know where I am from: and I have not come of my own accord, but he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.

29. But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me.

30. Then they sought to seize him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.

31. And many of the people believed in him, and said, When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man has done?

32. The Pharisees heard the people muttering such things about him; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.

33. Then Jesus said to them, Yet for a little while shall I be with you, and then I go to him who sent me.

34. You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, there you cannot come.

35. Then the Jews said among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to those dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

36. What manner of saying is this, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, there you cannot come?

37. On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.

38. He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.

39. (But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believe in him were to receive: for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.)

40. Many of the people, when they heard this, said, Truly this is the Prophet.

41. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?

42. Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes from the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, the village where David lived?

43. So there was a division among the people because of him.

44. And some would have seized him; but no man laid hands on him.

45. Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees; who said to them, Why have you not brought him?

46. The officers answered, Never did a man speak like this man.

47. Then the Pharisees answered them, Are you also deceived?

48. Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?

49. But this crowd, which does not know the law, is cursed.

50. Nicodemus (who came to Jesus earlier, and who was one of them) said to them,

51. Does our law judge any man, before it hears him, and knows what he is doing?

52. They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see: no prophet arises out of Galilee.

53. [And everyone went to his own house.

## John 8

1. But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.

2. And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.

3. And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery; and when they had placed her in the midst,

4. They said to him, Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.

5. Now Moses, in the law, commanded us to stone such women; but what do you say?

6. This they said, testing him, that they might have grounds to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.

7. But when they continued asking him, he stood up, and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to cast a stone at her.

8. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

9. And when they heard it, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest: and Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing there.

10. When Jesus stood up, and saw no one but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are your accusers? has no man condemned you?

11. She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.]

12. Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

13. Therefore, the Pharisees said to him, You bear testimony of yourself; your testimony is not true.

14. Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear testimony of myself, yet my testimony is true: for I know where I came from, and where I go; but you do not know where I come from, or where I go.

15. You judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

16. And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I am with he who sent me.

17. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.

18. I am one who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.

19. Then they said to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you would have known my Father also.

20. These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour had not yet come.

21. Then Jesus said again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.

22. Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? because he said, Where I go, you cannot come.

23. And he said to them, You are from below; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.

24. Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you do not believe that I am he, you shall die in your sins.

25. Then they said to him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, That which I have been saying to you from the beginning.

26. I have many things to say and to judge about you: but he who sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.

27. They did not understood that he spoke to them of the Father.

28. Then Jesus said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall know that I am he, and that I do nothing by myself; but I speak these things as my Father has taught me.

29. And he who sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I always do those things that please him.

30. As he spoke these words, many believed in him.

31. Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him, If you continue in my word, then you are my disciples indeed;

32. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

33. They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how is it that you say, You shall be made free?

34. Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the slave of sin.

35. And the slave does not abide in the house forever: but the Son abides forever.

36. If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.

37. I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.

38. I speak that which I have seen in the presence of my Father: and you do that which you have heard from your father.

39. They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.

40. But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this Abraham did not do.

41. You do the deeds of your father. Then they said to him, We are not illegitimate children; we have one Father, even God.

42. Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; for I did not come of my own accord, but he sent me.

43. Why do you not understand my speech? it is because you cannot bear to hear my word.

44. You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature: for he is a liar, and the father of lies.

45. And because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me.

46. Which of you convicts me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?

47. He who is of God hears God's words: therefore you do not hear them, because you are not of God.

48. Then the Jews answered and said to him, Do we not rightly say that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?

49. Jesus answered, I do not have a devil; but I honour my Father, and you dishonour me.

50. I do not seek my own glory: but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.

51. Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps my word, he shall never see death.

52. Then the Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he shall never taste of death.

53. Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are also dead: whom do you make yourself out to be?

54. Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me; of whom you say, that he is your God:

55. Yet you have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I do not know him, I would be a liar like you: but I do know him, and keep his word.

56. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.

57. Then the Jews said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?

58. Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.

59. Then they took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.

## John 9

1. And as he passed by, he saw a man who was blind from his birth.

2. And his disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?

3. Jesus answered, It was not that this man sinned, or his parents: but it was so the works of God would be made manifest in him.

4. We must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.

5. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

6. When he had said this, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,

7. And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which means, Sent.) He went his way, and washed, and came back seeing.

8. The neighbours, and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, Is this not the one who sat and begged?

9. Some said, This is he: others said, No, but he is like him: but he said, I am the one.

10. Therefore they said to him, How were your eyes opened?

11. He answered and said, A man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received my sight.

12. Then they said to him, Where is he? He said, I do not know.

13. They brought to the Pharisees him who had been blind.

14. And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

15. Then again the Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.

16. Therefore, some of the Pharisees said, This man is not of God, because he does not keep the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such miraculous signs? And there was a division among them.

17. They said to the blind man again, What do you say of him, since he opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

18. But the Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight.

19. And they asked them, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see?

20. His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:

21. But by what means he now sees, we do not know; or who has opened his eyes, we do not know: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.

22. His parents said this because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man confessed him to be the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.

23. Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.

24. Then again they called the man who was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

25. He answered and said, Whether he is a sinner, I do not know: one thing I do know, that, though I was blind, now I see.

26. Then they said to him again, What did he do to you? how did he open your eyes?

27. He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not listen: why do you want to hear it again? do you also want to be his disciples?

28. Then they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.

29. We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this man, we know not where he comes from.

30. The man answered and said to them, Why, this is a marvellous thing; you do not know where he is from, yet he has opened my eyes.

31. Now we know that God does not hear sinners: but if any man is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he hears him.

32. Since the world began it has not been heard that any man opened the eyes of one who was born blind.

33. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.

34. They answered and said to him, You were born in utter sin, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.

35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe in the Son of man?

36. He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?

37. And Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he who talks with you.

38. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

39. And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see might see; and that those who see might be made blind.

40. And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?

41. Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.

## John 10

1. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs in by some other way, he is a thief and a robber.

2. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

3. To him the gatekeeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his sheep by name, and leads them out.

4. And when he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

5. A stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him: for they do not know the voice of strangers.

6. Jesus spoke this parable to them: but they did not understand what he was saying to them.

7. Then Jesus said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

8. All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

9. I am the door: if any man enters by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

10. The thief comes only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I have come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

11. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

12. But he who is a hireling, and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf attacks them, and scatters the sheep.

13. The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and does not care for the sheep.

14. I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me,

15. Just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.

16. And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold: I must bring them also, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

17. Therefore my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it up again.

18. No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. This commandment I have received from my Father.

19. There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.

20. And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why do you listen to him?

21. Others said, These are not the words of one who has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

22. And it was the feast of the dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.

23. And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

24. Then the Jews came round about him, and said to him, How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.

25. Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

26. But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.

27. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

28. And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, nor shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

29. My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

30. I and the Father are one.

31. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

32. Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?

33. The Jews answered him, saying, We do not stone you for a good work; but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself out to be God.

34. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?

35. If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;

36. Do you say of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?

37. If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.

38. But if I do them, though you do not believe me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.

39. Therefore they sought again to seize him: but he escaped from their hands,

40. And went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John first baptized; and there he abode.

41. And many came to him, and said, John did no miraculous sign: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.

42. And many believed in him there.

## John 11

1. Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.

2. (It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

3. Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.

4. When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified through it.

5. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

6. Therefore, when he heard that he was sick, he remained for two more days where he was.

7. Then after that he said to his disciples, Let us go to Judaea again.

8. His disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were just recently seeking to stone you; and would you go there again?

9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.

10. But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.

11. These things he spoke: and then he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awaken him.

12. Then his disciples said, Lord, if he is sleeping, he shall recover.

13. Yet Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of natural sleep.

14. Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

15. And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.

16. Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

17. When Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.

18. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, less than two miles off:

19. And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.

20. Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat in the house.

21. Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

22. But I know, that even now, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.

23. Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.

24. Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection on the last day.

25. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live:

26. And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?

27. She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.

28. And when she said this, she went her way, and called Mary her sister quietly, saying, The Teacher has come, and is calling for you.

29. As soon as she heard this, she rose quickly, and came to him.

30. Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.

31. When the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.

32. Then when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

33. Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he was deeply moved, and was troubled,

34. And said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see.

35. Jesus wept.

36. Then the Jews said, Behold how he loved him!

37. But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have kept this man from dying?

38. Jesus, again deeply moved within himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

39. Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days.

40. Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you, that, if you would believe, you would see the glory of God?

41. Then they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.

42. And I knew that you always hear me: but because of the people who stand here I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.

43. And when he had said this, he cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

44. And the dead man came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go.

45. Then many of the Jews who came with Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed in him.

46. But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things Jesus had done.

47. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What should we do? for this man performs many miraculous signs .

48. If we let him go on like this, all men will believe in him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and our nation.

49. And one of them, named Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,

50. Nor do you consider that it is expedient for you, that one man should die for the people, so that the whole nation should not perish.

51. And this he did not speak of his own accord: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;

52. And not for that nation only, but also that he should gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.

53. Then from that day forth they planned together how to put him to death.

54. Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews; but went away from there to a region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with his disciples.

55. And the Jewish passover was near at hand: and many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.

56. They sought for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What do you think, that he will not come to the feast?

57. Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.

## John 12

1. Six days before the passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.

2. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.

3. Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.

4. Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who would later betray him, said,

5. Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?

6. He said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the money box, and stole what was put in it.

7. Then Jesus said, Let her alone: she has kept it for the day of my burial.

8. For the poor you have with you always; but me you do not always have.

9. Now a large multitude of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came not only because of Jesus, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

10. But the chief priests discussed how they might put Lazarus to death also;

11. Because on account of him many of the Jews went away, and believed in Jesus.

12. On the next day many people who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

13. Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.

14. And Jesus, when he had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,

15. Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.

16. These things his disciples did not understand at first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.

17. Now the people who were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, kept bearing witness.

18. For this cause also the people went out to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miraculous sign.

19. Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves, You see, you have accomplished nothing: behold, the world has gone after him.

20. And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast:

21. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and said to him, Sir, we want to see Jesus.

22. Philip came and told Andrew: then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

23. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone: but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.

25. He who loves his life shall lose it; and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it for life eternal.

26. If any man serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also: if any man serves me, the Father will honour him.

27. Now is my soul troubled; and shall I say, Father, save me from this hour? but it is for this reason that I came to this hour.

28. Father, glorify your name. Then there came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

29. The crowd that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.

30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not for me, but for your sakes.

31. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.

33. This he said, to signify what sort of death he should die.

34. The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides forever: and how is it that you say, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

35. Then Jesus said to them, Yet for a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you: for he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.

36. While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be sons of light. These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and hid himself from them.

37. But though he had done so many miraculous signs before them, yet they did not believe in him:

38. That the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?

39. Therefore they could not believe, because as Isaiah also said,

40. He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and turn to me, that I should heal them.

41. These things Isaiah said because he saw his glory and spoke of him.

42. Nevertheless, even among the chief rulers, many believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:

43. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

44. Jesus cried out and said, He who believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.

45. And he who sees me sees him who sent me.

46. I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.

47. And if any man hears my words, and does not believe, I do not judge him: for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

48. He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has one who judges him: the word that I have spoken, that shall judge him on the last day.

49. For I have not spoken of my own accord; but the Father who sent me, he commanded what I should say, and what I should speak.

50. And I know that his commandment is life eternal: therefore, whatever I speak, I speak as the Father has bidden me.

## John 13

1. Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.

2. It was during supper, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Jesus.

3. Knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was returning to God;

4. Jesus rose from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.

5. After that he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.

6. Then he came to Simon Peter: and Peter said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?

7. Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you do not understand now; but you shall understand later.

8. Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.

9. Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.

10. Jesus said to him, He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but he is clean all over: and you are clean, but not all of you.

11. For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, Not all of you are clean.

12. So after he had washed their feet, and had put on his garments, and had taken his place again, he said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?

13. You call me Teacher and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.

14. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.

15. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.

16. Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.

17. If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.

18. I do not speak of all of you: I know whom I have chosen: but it is that the scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.

19. Now I tell you before it happens, that, when it has come to pass, you may believe that I am he.

20. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.

21. When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.

22. Then the disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.

23. Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

24. Therefore Simon Peter beckoned to him, that he should ask of whom he spoke.

25. He, lying on Jesus' breast, said to him, Lord, who is it?

26. Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

27. And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.

28. Now no man at the table knew why he spoke this to him.

29. Some of them thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.

30. Having received the morsel he went out immediately: and it was night.

31. When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

32. If God is glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall immediately glorify him.

33. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you: Where I go, you cannot come.

34. A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, so you also love one another.

35. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

36. Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.

37. Peter said to him, Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.

38. Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, until you have denied me thrice.

## John 14

1. Let not your hearts be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.

2. In my Father's house are many dwelling places: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

3. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.

4. And you know the way to the place where I go.

5. Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going; so how can we know the way?

6. Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.

7. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also: and from henceforth you know him, and have seen him.

8. Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it will satisfy us.

9. Jesus said to him, Have I been so long with you, and yet you do not know me, Philip? he who has seen me has seen the Father; and how then do you say, Show us the Father?

10. Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I do not speak of my own accord: but the Father who dwells in me, he does his works.

11. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me because of the works themselves.

12. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and he shall do greater works than these; because I go to my Father.

13. And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

14. If you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.

15. If you love me, you will keep my commandments.

16. And I will pray to the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever;

17. That is the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him, neither does it know him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.

18. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.

19. Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you shall see me: because I live, you also shall live.

20. On that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.

21. He who has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is who loves me: and he who loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

22. Judas, not Iscariot, said to him, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?

23. Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loves me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.

24. He who does not love me does not keep my words: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.

25. These things I have spoken to you while I am still present with you.

26. But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.

27. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

28. You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

29. And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you might believe.

30. Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes; he has no power over me,

31. But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.

## John 15

1. I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.

2. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

3. Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.

4. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine; neither can you, unless you abide in me.

5. I am the vine, you are the branches: He who abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.

6. If a man does not abide in me, he is thrown away as a branch, and withers; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

7. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.

8. By this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so prove to be my disciples.

9. As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you: abide in my love.

10. If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

11. These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

12. This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.

13. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

14. You are my friends, if you do what I command you.

15. No longer do I call you servants; for the servant does not know what his lord is doing: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.

16. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you to go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: so that whatever you shall ask from the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

17. This I command you, that you love one another.

18. If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.

19. If you were of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, because I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

20. Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.

21. But all these things they will do to you for my name's sake, because they do not know him who sent me.

22. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.

23. He who hates me hates my Father also.

24. If I had not done among them the works which no other man has done, they would not have sin: but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.

25. But this came to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

26. But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:

27. And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.

## John 16

1. These things have I spoken to you, that you should not stumble.

2. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time comes when whoever kills you will think that he is serving God.

3. And these things they will do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.

4. But these things I have spoken to you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. These things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.

5. But now I go to him who sent me; and none of you asks me, Where are you going?

6. But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.

7. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; It is for your good that I go away: for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.

8. And when he has come, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:

9. Of sin, because they do not believe in me;

10. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you will see me no more;

11. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

12. I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.

13. Yet when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of his own accord; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.

14. He shall glorify me: for he shall take what is mine, and shall show it to you.

15. All things that the Father has are mine: therefore I said that he shall take what is mine, and shall show it to you.

16. In a little while you shall not see me: and again, in a little while, you shall see me.

17. Then some of his disciples said among themselves, What is this that he says to us, In a little while you shall not see me: and again, in a little while, you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?

18. Therefore they said, What is this that he says, A little while? we cannot tell what he is saying.

19. Now Jesus knew that they wanted to question him, and said to them, Do you enquire among yourselves about what I meant when I said, In a little while you shall not see me: and again, in a little while, you shall see me?

20. Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

21. A woman, when she is in travail, has sorrow, because her hour has come: but as soon as she has delivered the child, she remembers the anguish no more, for joy that a child has been born into the world.

22. So also you have sorrow now: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and no man shall take your joy from you.

23. And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.

24. Until now you have asked for nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.

25. These things I have spoken to you in parables: but the time comes when I shall no longer speak to you in parables, but I shall tell you plainly of the Father.

26. On that day you shall ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you:

27. For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father.

28. I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

29. His disciples said to him, Lo, now you speak plainly, and are not using a proverb.

30. Now we are sure that you know all things, and do not need any man to question you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.

31. Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?

32. Behold, the hour comes, yea, has now come, when you shall be scattered, every man to his own home, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

33. These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

## John 17

1. These words Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you:

2. Since you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.

3. And this is life eternal, that they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

4. I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.

5. And now, O Father, glorify me together with you; with the glory which I had with you before the world was.

6. I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world: yours they were, and you gave them to me; and they have kept your word.

7. Now they know that all things that you have given me are from you.

8. For I have given to them the words which you gave me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came from you, and they have believed that you did send me.

9. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom you have given me; for they are yours.

10. And all mine are yours, and yours are mine; and I am glorified in them.

11. And now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep those whom you have given me in your own name, that they may be one, as we are.

12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those you gave me I have kept, and none of them has been lost, except the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

13. And now I come to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

14. I have given them your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

15. I do not pray that you would take them out of the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.

16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

17. Sanctify them in the truth: your word is truth.

18. As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

19. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified in the truth.

20. I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who shall believe in me through their word;

21. That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.

22. And the glory which you gave me I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one:

23. I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfectly one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.

24. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.

25. O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these know that you have sent me.

26. And I have declared to them your name, and will declare it: that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.

## John 18

1. When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the ravine of the Kedron, to where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.

2. And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often met there with his disciples.

3. Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

4. Then Jesus, knowing all that would come upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom do you seek?

5. They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. And Judas, who betrayed him, stood with them.

6. As soon as he had said to them, I am he, they drew back, and fell to the ground.

7. Then he asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

8. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: therefore if you seek me, let these men go their way:

9. This happened so that what he had spoken might be fulfilled, Of those whom you gave me I have lost none.

10. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.

11. Then Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into its sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?

12. Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,

13. And led him first to Annas; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.

14. Now Caiaphas was the one, who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

15. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the court of the high priest.

16. But Peter stood outside at the door. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.

17. Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this man's disciples? He said, I am not.

18. Now the servants and officers who stood there had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.

19. The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.

20. Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews all come together; and I said nothing in secret.

21. Why do you ask me? ask those who heard what I spoke to them: they know what I said.

22. And when he had said this, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Is that how you answer the high priest?

23. Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why do you strike me?

24. Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

25. And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said to him, Are you not also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.

26. One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman of the man whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?

27. Peter denied it again: and immediately the cock crowed.

28. Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves did not go into the praetorium, so they would not be defiled, but might eat the passover.

29. Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?

30. They answered and said to him, If he were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered him up to you.

31. Then Pilate said to them, You take him and judge him according to your own law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:

32. This was so the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke to signify what kind of death he should die.

33. Then Pilate entered the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?

34. Jesus answered him, Do you say this of your own accord, or did others tell you of me?

35. Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you up to me: what have you done?

36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I should not be delivered up to the Jews: but my kingdom is not of this world.

37. So Pilate said to him, You are a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.

38. Pilate said to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find no fault in him.

39. But you have a custom, for me to release someone to you at the passover: do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?

40. Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

## John 19

1. Then Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.

2. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,

3. And came up to him and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and struck him with their hands.

4. Pilate went forth again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.

5. Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man!

6. When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, You take him and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.

7. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God.

8. When Pilate heard these words, he was even more afraid;

9. And went again into the praetorium, and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.

10. Then Pilate said to him, You do not speak to me? do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?

11. Jesus answered, You would have no power over me unless it was given to you from above: therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.

12. And from then Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar's: whoever makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.

13. When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

14. And it was the day of preparation for the passover, about the sixth hour: and he said to the Jews, Behold your King!

15. But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.

16. Then he delivered him to them to be crucified.

17. And they took Jesus and led him away, and he, bearing his cross, went forth to a place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:

18. Where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side and Jesus in the middle.

19. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. Many of the Jews read this title: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Latin, and Greek.

21. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

22. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

23. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

24. Therefore they said among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be. This was so the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. Therefore the soldiers did these things.

25. Now by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

26. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!

27. Then he said to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her into his own home.

28. After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, said in fulfillment of the scripture, I thirst.

29. Now there was a vessel full of vinegar set there: and they soaked a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a hyssop branch, and held it to his mouth.

30. When Jesus received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.

31. Because it was the day of preparation, in order that the bodies would not remain upon the cross during the sabbath day (for that sabbath day was a high day,) the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

32. The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.

33. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they did not break his legs:

34. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.

35. And he who saw it has borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knows what he says is true, that you also might believe.

36. For these things came to pass that the scripture should be fulfilled, Not one of his bones shall be broken.

37. And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.

38. After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him permission. Therefore he came and took his body.

39. And Nicodemus also came, who first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight.

40. They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.

41. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.

42. Because of the Jewish day of preparation, as the tomb was near at hand, they laid Jesus there.

## John 20

1. The first day of the week Mary Magdalene came early, when it was yet dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.

2. Then she ran, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.

3. Therefore Peter went forth, with the other disciple, toward the tomb.

4. So they both ran together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb.

5. And he stooped down, and looked in, and saw the linen wrappings lying there; but he did not go in.

6. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb, and saw the linen wrappings lying there,

7. And the cloth, which had been around his head, was not lying with the linen wrappings, but was rolled up in a place by itself.

8. Then the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, went in also and he saw, and believed.

9. For as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.

10. Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.

11. But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the tomb,

12. And saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

13. And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.

14. And when she had said this, she turned around, and saw Jesus standing, but did not know that it was Jesus.

15. Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.

16. Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.

17. Jesus said to her, Do not hold me; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

18. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.

19. Then at evening of the same day, the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace be with you.

20. And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.

21. Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be with you: as my Father has sent me, even so I send you.

22. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit:

23. If you forgive the sins of any one, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any one, they are retained.

24. But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

25. The other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I shall see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.

26. After eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them: then Jesus came, though the doors were shut, and stood in their midst, and said, Peace be with you.

27. Then he said to Thomas, Reach here with your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here with your hand, and thrust it into my side: and do not be faithless, but believing.

28. And Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God.

29. Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.

30. Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:

31. But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.

## John 21

1. After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way:

2. Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples were together.

3. Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We will go with you. They went forth, and entered a boat; but that night they caught nothing.

4. But when the morning was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

5. Then Jesus said to them, Children, have you any fish? They answered him, No.

6. And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you shall find some. Therefore they cast it, and they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.

7. Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, (for he was stripped for work,) and cast himself into the sea.

8. And the other disciples came in the boat; (for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards,) dragging the net full of fish.

9. As soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.

10. Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have caught.

11. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three: and though there were so many, yet the net was not broken.

12. Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.

13. Then Jesus came, and took bread, and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.

14. This was now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.

15. So when they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.

16. He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Tend my sheep.

17. He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.

18. Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself, and walked where you wanted: but when you grow old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you do not want to go.

19. This he spoke to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him, Follow me.

20. Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following; the one who had leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is the one who betrays you?

21. Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?

22. Jesus said to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? you follow me.

23. Then this saying went abroad among the brethren, that this disciple should not die: yet Jesus did not said to him, He shall not die; but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?

24. This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.

25. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
