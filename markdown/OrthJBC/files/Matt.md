# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1.  This is the Sefer Toldot (Book of Genealogy) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (the King Messiah) Yehoshua (see NEHEMYAH 8:17; EZRA 3:8.  Also see ENDNOTES for Mt. 1:1 indicated by * ) Ben Dovid, Ben Avraham.  FROM AVRAHAM TO DOVID HAMELECH: THE AVOT (FATHERS, ANCESTORS) OF HAMELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS REBBISHE DYNASTY

2. Avraham, Yitzchak, Ya'akov, Yehudah and his brothers;

3. then,through Yehudah, Peretz and Zerach by Tamar; then Chetzron, Ram;

4. then Amminadav, Nachshon, Salmon;

5. then Bo`az by Rachav (Rahab); then Oved by Ruth, then Yishai (Jesse);

6. then Yishai fathered Dovid HaMelech. FROM DOVID HAMELECH TO THE TIME OF THE GOLUS (EXILE) IN BABYLON: THE AVOT OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH Dovid HaMelech, then Shlomo (Solomon) by the wife of Uriyah;

7. then Rechav'am (Rehoboam), Aviyah (Abijah), Asa,

8. then Yehoshafat, Yoram, Uziyahu (Uzziah);

9. then Yotam, Achaz (Ahaz), Chizkiyahu (Hezekiah),

10. then M'nasheh (Manasseh), Amon, Yoshiyahu (Josiah),

11. then Y'khanyahu (Jeconiah or Jehoiachin) and his achim from the days of the Golus in Babylon. FROM THE TIME OF THE GOLUS TO MOSHIACH

12. After Y'khanyahu, then Sh'altiel, then Z'rubavel

13. then Av'ichud, then Elyakim, then Azur;

14. then Tzadok, then Yakhin, then El'ichud;

15. then El'azar, then Mattan, then Ya'akov.

16. Ya'akov fathered Yosef, the ba'al (husband) of Miryam, from whom was born Yehoshua, who is called Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. [Yochanan 1:49]

17. So then, there were arba'a asar (fourteen) generations from Avraham to Dovid [trans. note: Dovid= DVD in Hebrew = [d= 4, v = 6, d = 4]= (4 + 6 + 4 = 14)], and there were arba'a asar (fourteen) dorot (generations) from Dovid to the Golus in Babylon, and there were arba'a asar (fourteen) generations from the Golus in Babylon to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.  YOSEF BEN DOVID AND MIRYAM AND KIDDUSHIN (BETROTHAL) AND THE HULEDET (BIRTH) OF MOSHIACH THE BECHOR (FIRST BORN SON), YEHOSHUA BEN DOVID (SEE BABA BATHRA 8:6, 130a)

18. The huledet (birth) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was as follows.  When Moshiach's Em, Miryam, had been given in erusin (betrothal, engagement) to Yosef, but before they came together, she was found "with child" through the Ruach HaKodesh.

19. Her shidduch, Yosef, being a tzaddik and not wanting to humiliate her publicly, planned to deal with the get (bill of divorce) in a private arrangement.  MIRYAM VINDICATED AS AN AISHES CHAYIL

20. Now just when Yosef had thought through to this tachlis (purpose)--hinei!--a malach Hashem (angel of the L-rd) appeared to him in a cholom (dream) [see BERESHIT 37:5], and said, "Yosef ben Dovid, do not shrink from taking Miryam in nessu'in (marriage) as your kallah (bride), because what has been conceived in her is through the Ruach Hakodesh.

21. And she shall bear BEN (Son) and you will call SHMO (his name) Yehoshua [trans. note: see ZECHARYAH 3:8; 6:11-12; NEHEMYAH 8:17; EZRA 3:8 where the TZEMACH or MOSHIACH is indicated by the personal name YEHOSHUA, which in Aramaic is YESHUA * ], because he will bring his people yeshu'a (rescue, salvation, deliverance) from their peysha'im (rebellions, transgressions)."

22. Now all this occurred so that which was spoken by Hashem through the Navi (prophet) might be fulfilled,

23. HINEI, HA'ALMAH HARAH V'YOLEDET BEN V'KARAT SHMO IMMANU-EL ("Behold, the  Virgin *  will be `with child` and will bear Son and will call his name Immanu-El" YESHAYAH 7:14), which translated means "Hashem is with us."

24. Then Yosef, rising up from sleep, did as the malach Hashem commanded him and he took his wife.

25. And he did not know her until she bore BEN (Son, YESHAYAH 7:14) and Yosef [Ben Dovid] called him by the name Yehoshua [Ben Dovid].*

## Matthew 2

1. Now after Yehoshua was born in Beit-Lechem Yehudah, in the days of Herod [the Great, the Roman "client"] king --hinei!-- chachamim (wise men) from eretz Mizrach (the land of the East) arrived in Yerushalayim,

2. saying, "Where is he that is born Melech HaYehudim? For we have seen his KOCHAV ("star," BAMIDBAR 24:17) in the Mizrach (East) and have come to fall down before him."

3. Because Herod the king heard this, he was terribly shaken, and all Yerushalayim with him.

4. And assemblying all the Rashei Hakohanim (Chief Priests) and Sofrim (Scribes, Torah-teachers, Rabbonim) of the people, he inquired of them the place where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was to be born.

5. They told him, "In Beit-Lechem Yehudah; because so it stands written by the Navi:

6. `And YOU, BEIT-LECHEM,("Bethlehem," MICHOH 5:1[2]) in eretz Yehudah, are by no means least among the shtetlach (towns) or ruling [clans] of Yehudah; because out of you will come a Moshel (Governor) who will be the Ro'eh Ami Yisroel (Shepherd of my people Israel).`"

7. Then Herod secretly summoned the chachamim and ascertained from them the exact date of the manifestation of the KOCHAV.

8. Then he sent them to Beth-Lechem, saying, "Go and make a thorough search for the yeled (child); and as soon as you have found him, report to me, so that I, as well as you, may come and fall down before him. "

9. After they heard the king, they departed, and--hinei!--the KOCHAV they had seen in the Mizrach (East) was going ahead of them til it came and stood above the place where the yeled was.

10. When they saw the KOCHAV, they rejoiced with exceedingly great nachas (joy).

11.  And, entering the bais (house), they beheld the yeled with Miryam his Em, and prostrated themselves before him. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

12.  And having been warned in a cholom (dream) not to return to Herod, they took refuge in their own country by another way.
 MOSHIACH IN EGYPT

13. And when they'd gone, hinei, a malach Hashem appeared to Yosef Ben Dovid in a cholom (dream), saying, "Arise, and take the yeled and his Em, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is about to seek the yeled to destroy him."

14. So, having got up, he took the yeled, and his Em by night and departed for Mitzrayim (Egypt).

15. And he was there until the death of Herod.  This was to fulfill what had been spoken by Hashem through the Navi, UMIMITZRAYIM KARATI LIVNI ("Out of Egypt have I called my Son," HOSHEA 11:1). 
 FIRST CENTURY SHOAH OF THE INNOCENTS

16. When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the chachamim, he was greatly enraged, and he ordered the slaughter of all the yeladim in Beit-Lechem and its vicinity who were two years old or under, in accordance with the time that he had learned from the chachamim.

17. Then came the fulfillment of what was spoken through Yirmeyah HaNavi:

18. KOL B'RAMAH NISHMAH ("A voice was heard in Ramah," YIRMEYAH 31:14[15]), "a voice of bitter weeping and mourning.  Rachel is crying for her yeladim; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." THE EXODUS OF MOSHIACH FROM EGYPT AND HIS RETURN TO A FIRST CENTURY "SHTETL"

19. When Herod died--hinei!--in Mitzrayim (Egypt) a malach Hashem appeared to Yosef in a cholom (dream),

20. saying, "Arise, and take the yeled and his Em and go to Eretz-Yisroel, for those seeking the life of the yeled are dead."

21. And Yosef arose and took the yeled and his Em, and entered Eretz-Yisroel.

22. And when Yosef heard that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Yehudah, Yosef was afraid to go there.  And, having been warned in a cholom, he departed into the districts of the Galil.

23. And Yosef made his home in the shtetl (Jewish community, village) called Natzeret, so that that which was spoken by the Neviim might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Natzri." *

## Matthew 3

1. Now in those days Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva appears, preaching, crying out as a maggid (preacher) [for the Moshiach] in the midbar (wilderness) of Yehudah,

2. saying, "Make teshuva, for the Malchut HaShomayim has come near."

3. For this is the one spoken of through Yeshayah the Navi, saying, KOL KOREY BAMIDBAR ("A voice of one shouting in the wilderness," YESHAYAH 40:3): `Prepare the Derech Hashem (the way of the L-rd). Make his paths straight!`"

4. Now Yochanan himself had camel-hair clothing and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was arbe (locusts) and devash (wild honey).

5. Then all Yerushalayim and all Yehudah and the whole region of the Yarden were going out to him.

6. Making vidduy (confession) [to Hashem] of their averos (sins), they were submitted to a tevilah (immersion) by him, using the Yarden River as a mikveh mayim.

7. But when he saw many of the Perushim and Tzedukim coming to where he was using the Yarden as a mikveh mayim, he said to them, "You yeladim of nachashim (snakes)!  Who warned you to flee from the charon af [Hashem] habah (the coming burning wrath of Hashem)?

8. "Produce p'ri tov l'teshuva (fruit worthy of repentance)!

9. "Do not presume to say to yourselves, `We have the yichus (proud lineage), we have the zechut Avot (merit of the Fathers) of Avraham Avinu (our father Abraham).`  For I say to you that Hashem is able to raise up from these avanim (stones) banim (sons) of Avraham.

10. "And already the ax is laid at the shoresh haAitzim (the root of the trees); therefore, every aitz not producing p'ri tov (good fruit) is cut down and thrown into the aish (fire).

11. "I give you a tevilah (immersion) in a mikveh mayim for teshuva, but Hu HaBah (He who Comes, i.e. Moshiach) after me has more koach (power) than me.  I am not worthy to remove his sandals.  He will give you a tevilah (immersion) with the Ruach Hakodesh and aish (fire).

12. "The winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear out his threshing floor, and he will gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable aish (fire)." THE TEVILAH OF THE KOHEN MOSHIACH IN THE MIKVEH MAYIM OF THE YARDEN RIVER (SEE TEHILLIM 110:1-4; VAYIKRA 16:4,24; DANIEL 9:24)

13. Then Yehoshua comes from the Galil to the Yarden to Yochanan, to submit to Yochanan's tevilah (immersion).

14. But Yochanan would have deterred him, saying, "I have need to submit to your tevilah (immersion), and yet you come to me?"

15. But answering him, Yehoshua said, "Permit it now, for thus it is proper to fulfill all Tzidkat Hashem [DANIEL 9:24]."

16. And having received the tevilah in the Yarden's mikveh mayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach immediately came up.  And--hinei!--the Shomayim were opened to him, and he saw the Ruach Hashem descending like a yonah (dove) and coming upon him.

17. And, hinei, a bat kol (daughter of a voice, Divine voice) came out of Shomayim, saying, ZEH BNI AHUVI ASHER BO CHAFATSTI  ("This is my Son, the beloved, with whom I am well pleased" *).

## Matthew 4

1. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was led up into the midbar by the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem to undergo temptation by Hasatan.

2. And, having undergone a tzom (fast) for arba'im yom v'arba'im lailah, afterwards Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was famished.

3. And the tempter came to him and said to him, "If you are the Ben HaElohim, then speak the command that these avanim (stones) become lechem (bread)."

4. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered, "Katuv (It is written), LO 'AL HALECHEM L'VADOH Y'CHE-YEH HAADAM, KI 'AL KOL MOTZAH FI HASHEM. ("Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of Hashem", DEVARIM 8:3).

5. Then Hasatan takes Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to the Ir Hakodesh (the Holy City) and set him atop the pinnacle of the Beis Hamikdash,

6. and says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "If you are the Ben HaElohim, then throw yourself down, for katuv (it is written), MALACHAV Y'TZAV-VEH LACH ("His angels he will command concerning you") "and upon their hands they will lift you up lest you strike your foot against a stone," TEHILLIM 91:11-12.)

7. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Hasatan, "Again, it is written, LO TENASSU ES HASHEM ELOHEICHEM ("Do not test Hashem your G-d" DEVARIM 6:16).

8. Again, Hasatan takes Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to a very high mountain and shows him all the mamlechot (kingdoms) of the Olam Hazeh and the kavod (glory) of them.

9. And Hasatan said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "All these things I will give to you, if you will fall down V'TISHTACHAVEH (`and you will bow down` to, [DEVARIM 5:9]) me."

10. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "Depart, Hasatan!  For katuv (it is written), ES HASHEM ELOHEICHA TIRAH V'OTO TA'AVOD ("The L-rd your G-d you shall fear and Him you shall worship," DEVARIM 6:13).

11. Then Hasatan leaves him, and, hinei, malachim came and attended to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. MOSHIACH'S KEHILLAH BEGINS TO FORM IN THE GALIL, WITH ITS ROSH HAEDAT AND MANHIG, REBBE MELECH  HAMOSHIACH, SURROUNDED BY MOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM AS ACHIM (BROTHERS) WHO BECOME CHAVERIM AND CHAVRUTA (STUDY COMPANIONS) IN MOSHIACH

12. Now, having heard that Yochanan was arrested, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach departed into the Galil.

13. And having left behind Natzeret, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach headquartered in K'far-Nachum by the sea, in the environs of Z'vulun and Naftali.

14. This was to fulfill what was spoken through Yeshayah HaNavi,

15. ARTZAH Z'VULUN V'ARTZAH NAFTALI ("To the land of Z'vulun and to the land of Naftali," YESHAYAH 8:23-9:1 [9:1-2]), the way to the sea beyond the Yarden, Galil haGoyim,

16. the people sitting in CHOSHECH R'U OHR GADOL ("the people sitting in darkness saw a great light"), YOSHVEI V'ERETS TSALMAVET ("the ones living in the land of the shadow of death"), a light has dawned among them."

17. From then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, as a maggid, began to proclaim, saying, "Make teshuva, for the Malchut HaShomayim has come near."

18. And walking beside Lake Kinneret, (Sea of Galilee), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw two achim, Shimon, the one being called Kefa (Petros), and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were daiyagim (fishermen).

19. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, "Come, follow me, and I will make you daiyagei adam (fishers of men)."

20. And immediately, leaving their nets, they followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

21.  And having gone on from there, he saw two other achim, Ya`akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan his brother, in the sirah (boat) with Zavdai their father, repairing their nets, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach summoned them.

22.  Immediately, leaving the sirah (boat) and their father, they followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  THE REFUAH SHELEMAH (COMPLETE HEALING) REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BRINGS --THE BEGINNING OF MOSHIACH'S MA'ASIM TOVIM (GOOD DEEDS) AND NISIM (MIRACLES)

23. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went about in all the Galil, exercising the ministry of moreh (teacher) in their shuls and of maggid (preacher) of the Besuroh Tovoh (Good Tiding of a Joyous Event), the Besuras HaGeulah (the Good News of Redemption) of the Malchut Hashem, *  and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went about administering refu'ah (healing) to every disease and every illness of the people.

24. And the report went out about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach throughout all Syria; and they brought to him all the cholim (sick) with various illnesses and machalot, demoniacs, epileptics, and paralytics, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach brought them refu'ah.

25. And from the Galil, the Decapolis, Yerushalayim, Yehudah, and Ever-haYarden--from all these places great multitudes followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

## Matthew 5

1. When Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw the multitudes, he ALAH HAHAR ("went up the mountain," SHEMOT 19:3) and when he sat down, his talmidim came to him.

2.  Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to speak, and gave them this torah (teaching), saying,

3. "Ashrey ANIYEY RUACH ("Blessed/Happy are the poor in spirit," YESHAYAH 66:2) for theirs is the Malchut HaShomayim.

4.  Ashrey are the AVELIM ("the ones mourning,"YESHAYAH 61:2), for they will be comforted.

5.  Ashrey are the ANAVIM ("humble," YESHAYAH 29:19; TZEFANYAH (ZEPH) 2:3), for YIRESHU A'RETZ ("they will inherit the land," TEHILLIM 37:11).

6. Ashrey are the ones hungering and thirsting for Tzidkat Hashem (Righteousness, DANIEL 9:24), for they will be satisfied.

7. Ashrey are the merciful, for they will be shown rachamim (mercy).

8. Ashrey are those of LEV TAHOR ("pure heart," TEHILLIM 51:12 [10]), for they will see Hashem.

9. Ashrey are the peace makers, for they will be called bnei haElohim (sons of G-d).

10. Ashrey are the ones being persecuted because of Tzidkat Hashem (`righteousness,` DANIEL 9:24), for theirs is the Malchut HaShomayim.

11. Ashrey are you when they reproach you and persecute you and speak all kinds of lashon horah against you, speaking sheker (falsehood, lies) because of me [Moshiach].

12.  Have simcha (joy) and lev same'ach (glad heart), for your sachar (reward) is great in Shomayim, for thus they persecuted the Nevi'im before you.



 MOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM ARE THE MELACH HA'ARETZ (SALT PRESERVING AGAINST RA'AH)

13. You are the melach ha'aretz (salt of the earth), but if the salt becomes tasteless, in what way will it become salty again?  It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled by men.  MOSHIACH'S NER TAMID SHINING THROUGH HIS TALMIDIM

14. You are the Ohr HaOlam (the Light of the World).  A city lying on a mountain top cannot be hidden.

15. No one, after lighting a menorah, places it under a measuring basket, but on the shulchan, and it gives light to kol anshey habais (all in the house).

16. In like manner, let your light shine before bnei Adam, so that they may see your ma'asim tovim (good works) and give kavod (glory) to your Av sh'baShomayim (Father in Heaven).  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON THE TORAH OF MOSHE RABBENU

17. Do not think that I came to abolish the Torah or the Nevi'im.  I did not come to abolish but to complete.

18. For, omein, truly I say to you, until Shomayim and ha'aretz pass away, not one yod, not one tag (ornamental flourish), will pass from the Torah until everything is accomplished.

19. Therefore, whoever annuls one of the least of these mitzvot (divine commandments) and so teaches bnei Adam, shall be called katon (least) in the Malchut HaShomayim, but whoever practices and teaches them, this one will be called gadol (great) in the Malchut HaShomayim.  *

20. For I say unto you that unless your Tzidkat Hashem (Righteousness) exceeds that of the Sofrim and Perushim, you will certainly not enter the Malchut HaShomayim.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE ASERES HA-DIBROS

21. You have heard that it was said to the ancients, LO TIRTZACH ("Do not murder," SHEMOT 20:13; DEVARIM 5:17), and every rotzeach (murderer) shall be liable to be the Bet Din (Court).

22. But I say to you, that everyone who harbors ka'as (anger) against his ach b'Moshiach, his chaver, shall be subject to mishpat (judgment); and whoever shall say to his ach b'Moshiach, `Shlemiel!` (`Good for nothing!`) will be subject to the Sanhedrin; and whoever shall say `Shoteh` (`Fool`) shall be subject to Aish Gehinnom (Fire of Hell).

23. Therefore, if you bring your korban to the Mitzbe'ach (altar), and there you remember that your ach b'Moshiach has something against you,

24. leave your korban there before the Mitzbe'ach, and go and first be reconciled to your ach b'Moshiach, and then come offer your korban.

25. Come to terms quickly with your ish riv (opponent in a lawsuit), while you are a fellow-traveller on the derech eretz, lest the ish riv might deliver you to the shofet (judge) and the shofet might deliver you to the shoter (law official) and the shoter might deliver you to the beit hasohar (prison house).

26.  For, omein, truly I say to you, you may never come out from there until you repay the last peruta (small coin). 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON THE NEED FOR TZNI'UT (MODESTY)

27. You have heard that it was said, LO TINAF  ("Do not commit adultery," SHEMOT 20:13[14]).

28. But I say to you that everyone looking upon a woman with ta'avah (lust) for her has already committed ni'uf (adultery) with her in his heart.

29. And if your right eye causes you to commit chet (sin), tear it out and throw it from you, for it is better for you that one of your evarim (members) be lost and not your whole basar (body, flesh) be thrown into Gehinnom.

30. And if your right hand causes you to commit chet, cut it off and throw it from you, for it is better for you that one of your evarim be lost and not that your whole basar may go into Gehinnom. 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TORAH ABOUT THE GET (DOCUMENT OF DIVORCE)

31. It was also said, `Whoever divorces his wife, let him give to her a GET, a SEFER KERITUT (`bill of divorce,` DEVARIM 24:1).`

32. But I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except for the dvar ("thing," DEVARIM 24:1) of zenut (fornication), makes her become a no'efet (adulteress), and whoever marries a gerusha (divorcee) commits ni'uf (adultery). REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TORAH ABOUT NEDERIM

33. Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, `You shall not break your nederim (vows), but you shall repay your vows to Hashem.`(see VAYIKRA 19:12; BAMIDBAR 30:3; DEVARIM 23:22)

34. But I say to you, Do not swear shevuot (oaths) at all, neither by Shomayim, for it is the kisseh Hashem (throne of G-d),

35. nor by ha'aretz, for it is the foot stool of his feet, nor by Yerushalayim, for it is the kiryat melech rav ("city of the great king," TEHILLIM 48:3[2]).

36. Neither are you to swear by your rosh, for you are not able to make one hair turn white or black.

37. But let your word be `ken, ken` (`yes, yes`) or `lo, lo` (`no, no,`), but anything beyond this is lashon horah.

38. You have heard that it was said, AYIN TACHAT AYIN, SHEN TACHAT SHEN ("An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," SHEMOT 21:24)

39. But I say to you, Do not set yourself against the rasha (evil person), but whoever hits you on your right cheek, turn to him also the other cheek.

40. And the one wishing to sue you and take your tunic, give to him also your kaftan.

41. And whoever will force you to go one mile, go with him two.

42. And the one asking you to give and the one wishing to borrow from you, from these do not turn away.   REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TEACHES AHAVAH/AGAPE FOR OYEVIM (ENEMIES)

43. You have heard that it was said, V'AHAVTAH L'REI'ACHAH ("You shall love your neighbor," VAYIKRA 19:18) and you shall hate your oyev (enemy).`

44. But I say to you, Love your enemies, and offer tefillos (prayers) for the ones bringing redifah (persecution) upon you.

45. Do this so that you may become banim of your Av sh'baShomayim, for his shemesh (sun) he makes to rise on the ra'im (evil ones) and the tovim (good ones), and he sends his geshem (rain) upon the tzaddikim (righteous ones) and the resha'im (unrighteous ones).

46. For if you have ahavah (love) for the ones who have ahavah for you, what sachar* (reward) do you have?  Even the mochesim (tax-collectors) do that, don't they?

47. And if you give "shalom" greetings only to your achim, what extraordinary thing are you doing? Don't even the Goyim do the same?

48. Therefore, be shlemim (complete), even as is your Av sh'baShomayim."

## Matthew 6

1. "Be careful that you don't practice your tzedakah before bnei Adam in order to varf (show off) to be seen by bnei Adam;  for then you have no sachar (reward) with your Av sh'baShomayim.

2. Therefore, whenever you contribute tzedakah, don't blow the shofar before you, as the tzevu'im (hypocrites) do in the shuls and in the streets, in order that they may receive kavod (glory) from bnei Adam.  Omein, truly I say to you, they have their sachar.

3. But when you contribute tzedakah, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,

4. so that your tzedakah may be in secret, and your Av haRo'eh b'seter (Father the One seeing in secret) will give you sachar (reward) b'seter (in secret).   REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TEACHES HIS TALMIDIM HOW TO DAVEN

5. And whenever you daven, do not be as the tzevu'im (hypocrites);  for they love to stand and daven in the shuls and on the street corners so that they may be seen by an audience. Omein, truly I say to you, they have their sachar.

6. But you, whenever you daven, enter into the secret place, your secret cheder,*  and, having shut your door, offer tefillos to your Av Asher b'Seter (Father Who is in Secret), and your Av haRo'eh b'seter (Father the One seeing in secret) will give you sachar.

7. But when you daven, do not babble on and on maarich (long-winded) and vacuously and without kavanah like the Goyim. For the Goyim think that in their verbosity their techinnah (prayers of supplication) will be heard.

8. Therefore, be nisht azoi (not so); for your Av has da'as (knowledge) of what things you have need before you ask him.

9. Therefore, when you offer tefillos, daven like this:
                   THE MOSHIACH'S TEFILLAH            `Avinu sh'baShomayim` (`Our Father in heaven`), `yitkadash shmecha` (`hallowed be your Name`).

10. `Tavo malchutechah` (`Thy Kingdom come`)  `Ye'aseh r'tzonechah` (`Thy will be done`) `k'moh vaShomayim ken ba'aretz` (`on earth as it is in heaven`).

11. `Es lechem chukeinu ten lanu hayom` (`Give us today our daily bread`),

12. `u-s'lach lanu es chovoteinu ka'asher salachnu` (`and forgive us our debts`) gam anachnu lachayaveinu` (`as we also have forgiven our debtors`).

13. `V'al t'vieinu lidey nisayon` (`And lead us not into temptation` [Mt.26:41]) `ki im chaltzeinu min harah` (`but deliver us from evil [or the evil one]`).  [`Ki l'chah hamamlachah` (`for thine is the Kingdom`) `v'hagvurah` (`and the power`) v'hatiferet` (`and the glory`) `l'olmey olamim` (`forever`). `Omein`].
 MOSHIACH'S CONDITION FOR SELICHOT (PRAYERS FOR FORGIVENESS) TO BE ANSWERED

14. For if you give men mechila (forgiveness) for their chata'im (sins), so also your Av sh'baShomayim will give selicha (forgiveness) to you.

15. But if you do not give men mechila (forgiveness), neither will your chata'im receive selicha from your Av. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON UNDERGOING A TZOM (FAST)

16. And whenever you undergo a tzom (fast), don't be as the sullen tzevu'im (hypocrites), for they disfigure their faces to parade their tzom (fast).  Omein, truly I say to you, they have received their sachar.

17. But when you undergo a tzom, anoint your rosh with shimmen (oil) and wash your face,

18. so that your tzom is concealed from bnei Adam but not from your Av Asher b'Seter (Father Who is in Secret), and your Av haRo'eh b'seter (Father the One seeing in secret) will give you sachar.
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON OTZAROT IN SHOMAYIM

19. Do not store up for yourselves otzarot (treasures) on ha'aretz,  where moth and rust destroy and where ganavim (thieves) break in and steal.

20. But avekshtel (store up) for yourselves otzarot (treasures) in Shomayim, where neither moth nor rust destroys, neither do ganavim break in and steal.

21. For where your otzar (treasure) is, there also will be your lev (heart).

22. The eye is the menorah of the basar.  Therefore, if your eye is unblurred, then your whole basar will be lighted.

23. But if yours is the 'ayin horo (evil eye), your whole basar will be in choshech (darkness).

24. No one is able to serve two adonim (masters).   For either he will have sin'ah (hatred) for the one and ahavah (love) for the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.  You cannot serve Hashem and Mammon (Money).

25. Therefore, I say to you, Do not have a LEV ROGEZ (anxious heart, [DEVARIM 28:65]) about your life, what you might wear or what you might drink, nor for your basar, what you might put on. Is not life more than okhel (food) and basar more than malbush (clothing)?   SHATZ UP (EVALUATE) YOUR WORTH IN THE ESTIMATION OF HASHEM!

26. Look to the OF HASHOMAYIM (`birds of heaven,`IYOV 35:11), for they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and your Av sh'baShomayim feeds them.  Are you yourselves not worth more than they?

27.  And who among you by a LEV ROGEZ (DEVARIM 28:65) is able to add to his life-spand one cubit?

28. And why have a LEV ROGEZ (anxious heart) about malbush (clothing)? Observe the lilies of the field, how they grow.  They do not labor nor spin.

29. But I say to you that not even Sh'lomo in all his kavod was clothed as one of these.

30. And if Hashem thus clothes the grass of the field that exists today and tomorrow is thrown into an oven,  how much more will he clothe you, you ones of little emunah.

31. Therefore,do not have a LEV ROGEZ (DEVARIM 28:65), saying, `What might we eat?`  or `What might we drink?`  or `With what might we clothe ourselves?`

32. For all these things the Goyim strive for. For your Av sh'baShomayim bavorn (anticipates, realizes and resolves in advance) that you need all these things.

33. But seek first the Malchut Hashem and his Tzidkat Hashem, and all these things will be added to you.

34. Therefore, do not have a LEV ROGEZ (DEVARIM 28:65) for tomorrow, for makhar (tomorrow) will care for itself.  Each day has enough tsimmes (difficulties) of its own."

## Matthew 7

1. "Judge not lest you be judged.

2. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged, and with what measure you measure, it will be measured to you.

3.  And why do you see the speck in the eye of your brother, but you do not consider the beam in your own eye.

4.  Or how will you say to your brother, let me take the speck out from your eye, and--hinei!--the beam is in your own eye.

5. Tzevu'a (hypocrite), first take the beam out of your eye, and then you will see clearly enough to take out the speck from the eye of your brother.

6. Do not give the kodesh (the holy) to kelevim (dogs) nor throw your pearls before chazirim, lest they will trample them with their feet and turn around and tear you into pieces.

7. Keep asking and it shall be given to you; keep searching and you shall find; keep knocking and the delet (door) shall be opened to you.

8. For everyone asking receives, and the one searching finds, and to the one knocking the delet will be opened.

9. Or what man is there among you the ben of whom will ask for lechem (bread), and he will give him a stone.

10. Or if he asks for a dag (fish), will give him a nachash (snake)?

11. Therefore, if you, being ra'im (evil ones), *  know to give matanot tovot (good gifts) to your yeladim, how much more does your Av sh'baShomayim give tov (good) to the ones asking him.

12. Therefore, everything that you wish bnei Adam do for you, thus also you do for them. For this is the Torah and the Nevi'im.
 WITHOUT KEDUSHAH NO MAN WILL SEE HASHEM

13. Enter through the derech (way) of the delet hatzarut (door of narrowness), for wide is the delet and broad is the rehov (street) leading to Avaddon (destruction, hell, Abbadon), and rabbim (many) are they who enter through it.

14. But tzar (narrow) is the delet and constricted is the Derech (Way) that leads to Chayyim (life) and few are the ones finding it.

15. Beware of the nevi'ei hasheker (false prophets), who come to you in the malbush (clothing) of kevasim (sheep), but within are ravenous ze'evim (wolves).

16. By their perot (fruits) you will know them; surely grapes are not gathered from thorns nor figs from thistles, are they?

17. So every aitz tov (good tree) produces p'ri tov (good fruit), but the aitz nishchat (corrupt tree) produces p'ri rah.

18. An aitz tov is not able to produce p'ri rah nor is an aitz nishchat able to produce p'ri tov.

19. Kol aitz (every tree) not producing p'ri tov is cut off and is thrown into HaAish (the Fire) (Yeshayah 66:24; Daniel 12:2).

20. Therefore, by their perot (fruits) you shall know them.

21. Not all the ones saying to me, `Adoneinu, Adoneinu,` will enter the Malchut HaShomayim, but the one doing ratson Avi sh'baShomayim (the will of my Father in Heaven [Mt.26:39,42]).

22. Many will say to me [Moshiach] on that Day [the Yom HaDin, the Day of Judgment], `Adoneinu, Adoneinu, did we not speak as nevi'im in your Name?  Did we not cast out shedim (evil spirits, demons) in your Name? Did we not accomplish many niflaot (miracles) in your Name?`

23. And then I will tell them to their face, `I never knew you. Depart from me, you workers of mufkarut (lawlessness)` [TEHILLIM 6:9(8)].

24.  Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them, is like a chacham (wise man) who built his bais (house) upon the Tsur (Rock).

25. And the geshem (rain) came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that bais, and it did not fall, for it had been founded upon the Tsur (Rock).

26. And everyone hearing these words of mine [Divrei Moshiach] and not doing them is like the shoteh (fool), who built his bais upon the sand.

27. And the geshem (rain) came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that bais, and it fell, and gadolah was the mappalah (fall/downfall) of it."                             THE SAMCHUT (AUTHORITY) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

28. And it came about when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finished these divrei torah (words of teaching), the multitudes were filled with fear and wonder at his torah.

29. For his ministry of moreh (teacher) was as one having samchut (authority) and not as their Sofrim (scribes/torah teachers, rabbonim).

## Matthew 8

1. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came down from the mountain, many multitudes followed him.

2. And--hinei--an ish metzorah (a leper) there was who approached him and fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Adoneinu, if you choose, you can make me tahor (clean)."

3. And, having stretched out his hand, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach touched him, saying, "I am willing. Be made tahor."

4. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "See that you tell no one, but go and show yourself to the kohen and offer the korban about which Moshe gave mitzva as an edut (testimony) to them."

5. Now when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered into K'far-Nachum, a centurion approached him, begging him

6. and saying, "Adoneinu, my servant has been bedridden in the house, paralyzed, in terrible tza'ar (pain and suffering)."

7. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "I am coming.  I will give him refu'ah (healing)."

8. The centurion answered, "Adoneinu, * I am not worthy that you might come under my roof, but only say the dvar, and my servant will receive the refu'ah (healing).

9. For I also am a man under marut (authority), having soldiers subordinate to myself, and I say to this one, `Go!` and he goes, and to another `Come!` and he comes, and to my servant, `Do this!` and he does it."

10. And having heard this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was amazed and said to those who followed him, "Omein, I say to you, in no one in Yisroel have I found such great emunah.

11. And I say to you, that many from the mizrach (east) and the ma'arav (west) will come and will sit bimesibba (reclining) at tish with Avraham and Yitzchak and Ya'akov in the Malchut HaShomayim.

12. But the Bnei HaMalchut will be thrown out into the outer choshech (darkness), where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."

13. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to the centurion, "Go!  According to your bittachon (trust), your emunah (faith), let it be for you."  And his servant was given refu'ah (healing) punkt (exactly) at that hour.

14. When Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered the bais (house) of Kefa, he saw the chamot (mother-in-law, shviger) bedridden and fever-stricken.

15. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach touched her hand, and the fever left her.  She then began functioning as his mesharetet (servant, minister), serving Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

16. And when erev (evening) had come, they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach many possessed by shedim (evil spirits, demons), and he cast out the shedim with a dvar, and all the cholim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach healed.

17. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by Yeshayah the Navi, saying,  ACHEN CHOLAYEINU HU NASAH UMACHOVEINU S'VALAM ("Surely he took up our sicknesses and he carried away our sorrows," YESHAYAH 53:4).

18. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. IN THE OLAM HAZEH, THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH OF YISROEL REQUIRES TOTAL ALLEGIANCE, WITHOUT WHICH ONE CANNOT BE MEKABEL MOSHIACH

19. A sofer (scribe/Torah-teacher) approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and said, "Rebbe, I will follow you wherever you go."

20. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "Foxes have holes and the OF HASHOMAYIM (birds of heaven, IYOV 35:11) have nests, but the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] does not have a place where he may lay his head."

21. And another of Moshiach's talmidim said to him, "Adoneinu, allow me first to go and bury my father."

22. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "Follow me, and permit the mesim (dead ones, spiritually unregenerate ones) to bury their own mesim (dead ones)." REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL MOFET (MIRACLE WORKER)

23. And when he embarked into the sirah (boat), Moshiach's talmidim followed him.

24. And--hinei!--a great storm came up on the lake, so that the sirah (boat) was about to be covered by the waves. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH: THE NEW YONAH, ASLEEP IN THE SIRAH (BOAT) But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sleeping.

25. And Moshiach's talmidim approached and aroused him, saying, "Adoneinu, hoshieynu!  We are perishing!"

26. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Why are you fearful, you ones of little emunah?" REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH SHOWS HIMSELF ADON KOL HA'ARETZ
 Then, arising, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was great calm.

27. And the men were astonished, saying, "What sort of man is this!?  That even the winds and the sea obey him!" REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CASTS OUT THE SHEDIM

28. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came to the other side of the lake, in the land of the people of Gadara, he was met by two men possessed by shedim (demons); these men were coming out of the kevarim (tombs) of the burial caves and were so dangerous no one could pass on that road.

29. And--hinei--they screamed, saying, "Mah lanu valach, Ben HaElohim?" ("What to us and to you, Son of G-d?" i.e. What business do you have with us, Son of G-d") "Have you come here to torture us before the time [of the Yom HaDin, the Day of Judgment]?"                                                        THE UNCLEAN REJECT THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

30. Now there was feeding far away from them a large herd of chazirim (swine).

31. And the shedim begged Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying,"If you cast us out, send us into the herd of chazirim."

32. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Go away!"  So the shedim, coming out, went away into the chazirim. And--hinei!--all the herd of chazirim rushed down the bank into the lake, and they perished in the water.

33. And the herdsmen of the chazirim fled, and, having gone away into the town, they told the whole story of what had happened to the men possessed by shedim.

34. And--hinei!--the whole town came out to meet Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and seeing him, they begged him to depart from their area.

## Matthew 9

1. And, having embarked into a sirah (boat), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach crossed over [to the other side of the lake] and came into his own town.

2. And--hinei!--they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a paralytic lying upon a mat.  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having seen their emunah, said to the paralytic, "Chazak! (Be strong!) Selicha (forgiveness) is granted on your averos (sins)!"

3. And--hinei!--some of the Sofrim said to themselves, "This one commits Chillul Hashem!" [VAYIKRA 22:32]

4. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, reading their minds, said, "Why are you thinking ra'ah (evil) in your levavot (hearts)?

5. For which is easier to say, `Selicha is granted on your averos!` or`Arise and walk!`?

6. But in order that you may know that the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] has samchut * (authority) on earth to pronounce selicha (forgiveness) on chatta'im (sins)"--Moshiach then declared to the paralytic--"Arise, take up your mat and go to your bais (house)."

7. And arising, he went away to his bais.

8. And having witnessed this, the multitudes experienced yirat Shomayim and gave kavod to Hashem, who had given such samchut to men.  THE KERI'AH (CALLING) OF MATTITYAHU THE MOCHES --THE SICHAS SEUDAH SHEL TALMIDE CHACHAMIM (THE TABLE TALK OF THE WISE)

9.  And going away from there, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw a man called Mattityahu sitting in the tax office.   And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "Follow me." And Mattityahu arose and followed him.

10.  And it came about that while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting bimesibba (reclining) at tish (table) in the bais--hinei!--many mochesim (tax collectors) and chote'im (sinners) came and were sitting bimesibba (reclining) at tish (table) with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and his talmidim.

11. When the Perushim saw this, they were saying to Moshiach's talmidim, "Why does your Rebbe eat with the mochesim and the chote'im?"

12. But when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard this, he said, "It is not the bari'im (healthy ones) who have need of a rofeh (physician), but the cholim.

13. Go and learn what this means: CHESED CHAFATZTI V'LO ZEVACH ("I desire lovingkindness/mercy and not sacrifice" HOSHEA 6:6), for I have not come to call the tzaddikim but the chatta'im [to teshuva].  SHA'LOT ABOUT TZOMOT (FASTS) LEAD TO DIVREI TORAH ON THE NEED FOR MOSHIACH'S ORTHODOX JUDAISM AND ITS NEW WINESKINS (SEE ACTS CHAPTERS 15 AND 21)

14. Then Yochanan's talmidim approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Why do we and the Perushim often undergo tzomot (fasts), but your talmidim do not undergo tzomot?"

15. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Surely the Bnei haChuppah (wedding invitees) are not able to act as avelim (mourners) as long as the Chosson (Bridegroom) is with them. But the days will come when the Chosson is taken away from them, and then they will undergo tzomot.

16. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.

17. Neither do men put yayin chadash (new wine) into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined.  But they pour yayin chadash into new wineskins, and both are preserved."
 MOSHIACH'S TZITZIT AND TAHARAT HAMISHPOCHAH: EMUNAH AS THE MEANS OF BRINGING WOMEN BACK FROM THE STATE OF ESCHATOLOGICAL NIDDAH (SEPARATION)

18. While Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking these things to them--hinei--one of the nichbadim (dignitaries) [of the shul] came and fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "The bat (daughter) of me has just become niftar, but come lay your hand upon her and she will live."

19. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arose and, with his talmidim, followed him.

20. And--hinei!--an isha (woman) hemorrhaging twelve years approached him from behind and touched his garment at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's tzitzit.

21. For she was saying to herself, "If only I might touch his garment, I will receive refu'ah (healing)."

22. Turning and seeing her, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Chazak, bat (daughter) of me! Your emunah has brought you refu'ah." And the isha was healed from that hour.

23. And having come into the bais (house) of the nichbad (dignitary), and having seen the flute players and the unruly crowd,

24. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "Go away! For the yaldah (girl) is not among the mesim (dead ones)--she sleeps!" And they were making leitzonus (mockery, fun) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

25. But when the crowd had been put outside, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went in and took the yaldah by the hand and the yaldah was made to stand up alive.

26.  And this shema (report) went out into all that region.

27. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went on from there, two iverim (blind men) followed him, shouting loudly, "Chaneinu, Ben Dovid!"

28. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered the bais (house), the iverim (blind men) approached him and he says to them, "Do you have emunah that I am able to do this?"  They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Ken, Adoneinu."

29. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach touched their eyes, saying, "According to your emunah, let it be done for you."

30. And their eyes were opened. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sternly warned them, saying, "See to it that no one knows!"

31. But having gone out, they made Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach known in that entire district.

32. After they had departed, the people brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a mute man who was possessed by shedim.

33. And when the shedim had been cast out by Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the mute man spoke.  And the multitudes marveled, saying,  "Never was anything like this seen in eretz-Yisroel!"

34. But the Perushim said, "It was by the Sar HaShedim (the Prince of Demons) that this man casts out shedim!" THE RACHMONUS OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

35. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went about all the towns and villages exercising the ministry of moreh (teacher) in their shuls and of maggid (preacher) of the Besuras HaGeulah of the Malchut Hashem and bringing refu'ah to all the cholim, every machla (disease) and every illness.

36. And looking out on the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach felt rachamanut (mercy, compassion, sympathy) for his people, for they were distressed and nil'ah (weary) KA-TZON ASHER EIN LAHEM RO'EH (`like sheep without a shepherd,` BAMIDBAR 27:17).

37. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to his talmidim, "The katzir (harvest) is indeed great but the kotzerim (harvesters) are few.

38. Therefore, offer tefillos to the Adon HaKatzir (the L-rd of the Harvest) that He may send out Kotzerim into His Katzir.

## Matthew 10

1. And summoning his Shneym Asar (Twelve) Talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave to them samchut (authority) over shedim (unclean spirits), so as to cast them out, and samchut (authority) to call forth refu'ah to every machla and every illness.

2.  Now of the Shneym Asar Shluchim, the names are these: first, Shimon, the one being called Kefa, and Andrew his brother, Ya'akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan his brother,

3. Philippos and Bar-Talmai, T'oma and Mattityahu the moches, Ya'akov Bar-Chalfai and Taddai,

4. Shimon the Zealot and Yehudah from K'riot, who betrayed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES S'MICHAH COMMISSIONING TO THE SHNEYM ASAR

5. These Shneym Asar (Twelve) did Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach send out with the following mitzvot (divine commandments), saying:  "In the Derech HaGoyim (Way of the Gentiles, Gentile territory) do not go, and do not enter into any Shomron town,

6. but go rather to the Seh Oveid HaBeth Yisroel (the Lost Sheep of the House of Israel).

7. And, while going, preach that the Malchut HaShomayim is imminent and miyad.

8. Heal the cholim, raise the mesim (dead ones), cleanse the metzora'im (lepers), cast out the shedim (demons); freely you received, freely give.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH COMMANDS THAT HIS SHLUCHIM HAVE THE RIGHT TO EARN THEIR CHALLOH BY PREACHING THE BESURAS HAGEULAH

9. Take neither gold nor silver nor copper for your money-belts,

10. nor a beggar's sack for the road nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff, for the oseh hamelachah (the one doing the work) is worthy of his lechem.

11. And into whichever town or shtetl you enter, inquire who in it is a ben chayil (son of worthiness), and there remain until you leave.

12. And when you enter into the bais (house), give that household your "shalom!"

13. And if indeed the bais is a bais chayil (a house of worthiness), let your shalom come upon it; but if it is not a bais chayil, let your shalom return to you.

14. And whoever neither receives you nor listens to your divrei [Moshiach], as you are leaving and as you go outside of that bais (house) or city, then let it be NI'ER CHATZNO * (shake out the fold of the robe, i.e. wash one's hands of), shake off the dust of your feet.

15. Omein, I say to you, it will be more tolerable on Yom HaDin (the Day of Judgment) for S'dom and Amora than for that town. COMING TZOROS (TROUBLES)

16. Hinei!  I send you as kevesim (sheep) in the midst of ze'evim; therefore, have the saichel (intelligence) of nachashim (serpents) and be tamim (faultless) as yonim (doves).

17. And beware of bnei Adam, for they will deliver you up to the sanhedriyot (local councils/courts), and in their shuls they will subject you to the shot (whip).

18. And before moshelim (governors) and also melachim (kings) you will be led for my sake [for the sake of Moshiach], for an edut (testimony) to them and to the Goyim.

19. But when they deliver you up, do not be of a LEV ROGEZ (anxious heart, DEVARIM 28:65)  worried about how or what you are to say; for it will be given to you in that hour what you are to speak.

20. For you are not the ones speaking, but the Ruach Avichem (the Spirit of your Father) is the one speaking in you.

21. And brother will deliver up to death his own brother, even an abba his own yeled.  And yeladim will stand up against their horim (parents) and put them to death.

22. And you will be under the sinas chinam (baseless hatred) of kol bnei Adam on account of my name; but the one enduring ad es Ketz (until the time of the End) will receive the Yeshu'at Eloheinu (the Salvation of our G-d).

23. But when they persecute you in one city, flee to the other; for omein, I say to you, by no means will you complete the arim (towns) of Yisroel until the Bias HaMoshiach (Coming of the Moshiach, the Ben HaAdam, Daniel 7:13-14).

24.  A talmid is not above his Rebbe nor an eved (servant) above his Ba'al Bayit (master).

25. It is enough for the talmid that he be as his Rebbe, and the eved as his Ba'al Bayit. If they called the Ba'al Bayit (the master of the house) "Ba'al-zibbul," how much more the anashim (men) in his bais.

26. Therefore, do not fear them; for nothing has been veiled which will not be unveiled; and nothing has been hidden which will not be made known.

27. What I say to you in the choshech (darkness), you declare in the ohr (light); and what you hear whispered into your ears, shout, preach, from the rooftops.

28. And do not fear those who kill the basar (flesh), but are unable to kill the nefesh (soul); but rather fear the One who is able to destroy both basar and nefesh in Gehinnom.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for the least valuable copper coin?  And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from Avichem!

30. But, as far as you are concerned, even the hairs of your rosh have been numbered.

31. Therefore, al ta'arotz (do not be afraid)! You are of more value than many sparrows! 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND SHALOM BAYIS (FAMILY PEACE)--MAKING THE ANI MA'AMIN HODA'AH (CONFESSION) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEFORE MEN, EVEN IF MEN WANT YOU TO PUT MISHPOCHAH ABOVE MOSHIACH

32. Therefore, everyone who shall declare publicly the Ani Ma'amin of me [as Moshiach], before bnei haAdam, I will make hoda'ah (acknowledgment) of him before Avi sh'baShomayim.

33. But everyone who makes hakhchashah (denial) of me [as Moshiach], I also will make hakhchasha (denial) of him before Avi sh'baShomayim.

34. Do not think that I have come to bring shalom al ha'aretz (peace on the earth); I have not come to bring shalom but a cherev (sword).

35. For I came to divide a man against his Av, and a bat against her Em, and a kallah (bride) against her chamot (mother-in-law, shviger).

36. And the OIYVEI ISH ANSHEI VEITOH (`the enemies of a man will be the members of his own household,` MICHOH 7:6).

37. The one who has more ahavah (love) for a tata or a mama than for me [Moshiach] is not worthy of me [Moshiach], and the one who has more ahavah (love) for a ben or a bat than me is not worthy of me [Moshiach].  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TEACHES ON MESIRAS NEFESH [SELF-SACRIFICE]

38. The one who does not take up his aitz shel hinnazrut (tree of self-denial) and follow after me, is not worthy of me.

39. The one who has found his nefesh will lose it; the one who has lost his nefesh for my sake [lema'an Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] will find it.                                                     REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE SACHAR FROM HASHEM

40. The one who gives the kabbalat panim (welcome) to you gives the Baruch Haba (welcome) to me [to Moshiach], and the one who gives the Baruch Haba to me [Moshiach] gives the Baruch Haba to the One [Elohim haAv] who sent me.

41. The one who gives the Baruch Haba to a navi in the name of a navi will receive the sachar of a navi, and the one who gives the Baruch Haba to a tzaddik in the name of a tzaddik will receive the sachar of a tzaddik.

42. And whoever in the name of a talmid [of Moshiach] gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones [the least of the talmidim of Moshiach], omein, I say to you, he will by no means lose his sachar (reward)."

## Matthew 11

1. And it came about when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finished giving commands to his Shneym Asar Talmidim, he moved on from there, exercising the ministry of moreh (teacher) and maggid (preacher) in their cities.

2. Now when Yochanan, in the beit hasohor (prison), heard of the ma'a'sei haMoshiach (works of Moshiach), he sent his talmidim to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

3. They asked him, "Tell us. Are you Hu HaBa* (He who comes) or is our chiki'ah (wait) to be for the Bias (Coming) of another?"

4. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, saying, "Go give the shema (report) of what you see and hear to Yochanan:

5. the iverim (blind people) see, the pisechim (lame people) walk, the metzora'im (lepers) are cleansed, the chereshim (deaf people) hear, the mesim are made to stand up alive, and the aniyim (poor) have the Besuras HaGeulah preached to them. *

6. Ashrey (Happy) is the one who does not find a cause of michshol (falling) in me [as Moshiach]."

7. As they were leaving, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to speak to the multitudes about Yochanan, "What did you go out into the midbar (wilderness) to see?  A reed being shaken by the wind?

8. What did you go out to see?  Someone shtats in appearance attired in soft raiment? Hinei, the ones wearing soft raiment are in houses of melachim (kings).

9. But what did you go out to see?  A Navi?  Ken, I tell you. And one greater than a Navi.

10. This is he about whom it has been written, HINNENI SHOLEIACH MALACHI ("Behold, I will send my messenger") before your face, UPINNAH DERECH LEFANAI ("and he will prepare the way before me," [SHEMOT 23:20; MALACHI 3:1]).

11. Omein, I say to you, of those born of women, there has not appeared one greater than Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva, yet the person with the least chashivut (importance) in the Malchut HaShomayim is greater than he.

12. From the days of Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva until now, the Malchut HaShomayim has been under violent attack and the violent seize it with coersion.

13. For all the Nevi'im and the Torah prophesied until Yochanan.

14. And, if you are willing to accept it, he is the "Eliyahu," who is to come [MALACHI 3:23].

15. The one having ears, let him hear.

16. But to what will I compare this generation?  It is like yeladim sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to one another,

17. `We played the chalil (flute) for you, but you did not dance; we sang a kina (lament, funeral dirge) for you, and you did not mourn.

18.  For Yochanan came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,`He has a shed (demon, evil spirit).`

19. The Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) came eating and drinking, and they say, Hinei! A zolel (glutton) and a soveh (drunkard), a friend of mochesim (tax-collectors) and chatta'im (sinners).` Yet, Chochmah (wisdom) is vindicated by her ma'asim (works)."

20. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to reproach the arim (towns) in which were accomplished most of his gevurot (mighty deeds), because they did not make teshuva (repentance, turning from sin to G-d).

21. "Oy l'chah (Woe to you!), Korazin! Oy l'chah, Beit-Tzaidah! For if in Tzor and Tzidon were accomplished the gevurot that were accomplished among you, they would have made teshuva long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. Nevertheless, I say to you, it will be more bearable for Tzorand Tzidon than for you on Yom HaDin *  (the Day of Judgment).

23. And you, K'far-Nachum, were you lifted up as far as Shomayim? You shall be brought down as far as Sheol [Yeshayah 14:13,15]. For if in S'dom were accomplished the gevurot that were accomplished among you, S'dom would have a she'arit (remnant) today!

24. Nevertheless, I say to you, it will be more bearable for the land of S'dom on Yom HaDin than for you." IN SPITE OF APICURSIM (NONBELIEVERS), REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH OFFERS THANKS TO RABBONO SHEL OLAM

25. At that time, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Modeh Ani, Avi, Adon haShomayim v'ha'Aretz, (I thank you, Father, L-rd of Heaven and Earth), because you hid these things from the chachamim (wise) and those with saichel, and to them they are "nistar" (hidden, esoteric), and you revealed them unto ollelim (infants).

26. "Ken, Avi, for thus it was pleasing in your sight.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSIACH THE BEN YACHID OF HASHEM IS EIDEL (GENTLE) AND BRINGS TRUE SHABBOS MENUCHAH; THE BURDEN OF THE SINAI COVENANT AND ITS MITZVOT IS LIGHTER WHEN WE BECOME MEKABEL MOSHIACH BECAUSE HE HAS BROUGHT SHLEIMUT TO THE TORAH OF MOSHE RABBEINU AND HAS OVERCOME THE OLAM HAZEH

27. "All things were given to me by Avi, and no one has da'as (knowledge) of HaBen except HaAv, nor does anyone have da'as of HaAv, except HaBen, and anyone to whom HaBen chooses to unveil him.

28. "Come to me, all you who are burden-weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you Shabbos menuchah (rest).

29. "Take my ol (yoke) upon you and learn from me, for I am anav (humble) and lowly in lev (heart), and you will find menuchah (rest [RUTH 1:9]) for your nefashot (souls, YIRMEYAH 6:16].

30. "For my [Moshiach's] ol (yoke) is easy and my burden is light." [See Mt.23:4].

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went on Shabbos through the grainfields.  And the talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach were hungry and began to pick the heads of wheat and to eat them.

2. But the Perushim, seeing this, said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Hinei! Your talmidim are doing what is asur (forbidden) to do on Shabbos."

3. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Have you not read what Dovid HaMelech did when he and those with him were hungry,

4. "how he entered into the Beit Hashem and ate the Lechem HaPanim (the Bread of the Presence), which was not mutar (permissible) for him to eat nor the ones with him, but only for the kohanim alone?

5. "Or have you not read in the Torah that on Shabbos the kohanim in the Beis Hamikdash commit Chillul HaYom HaShabbos (desecration of the Sabbath Day) and yet are blameless?

6. "But I say to you that something greater than the Beis Hamikdash is here.

7. "But if you had known what this means, CHESED CHAFATZTI V'LO ZEVACH ("I desire mercy and not sacrifice" HOSHEA 6:6), you would not have condemned the innocent.

8. "For the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) is Adon HaShabbos."

9. And having gone from there, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went into their shul.

10. And hinei!  there was a man with a withered hand. And they questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, asking "Is it mutar (permissible) to administer refu'ah (healing) on Shabbos?"  They did this in order to bring accusation against him.

11. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "What man will there be among you, who owns a kevesh (sheep), and if it falls into a pit on Shabbos, will not take hold of it and lift it out?

12. Therefore, how much more valuable is a man than a sheep. For this reason, it is mutar (permissible) on Shabbos to do good."

13. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And the man stretched out his hand, and it was restored to health as the other hand.

14. But the Perushim went out and took counsel against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach so that they might destroy him.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE CHOSEN EVED HASHEM

15.  But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, knowing this, departed from there.  And many multitudes followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and he administered refu'ah to them all.

16. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach warned them that they should not make him manifest.

17. This was to fulfill what was spoken through Yeshayah HaNavi, saying,

18. HEN AVDI ETMACH BO, BECHIRI RATZTAH NAFSHI, NATATI RUCHI 'ALAV, MISHPAT LAGOYIM YOTZI ("Here is my Servant, whom I uphold, my Chosen One in whom my Soul delights, I will put my Spirit on him, he will bring Justice to the Nations," YESHAYAH 42:1)

19.  LO YITZAK V'LO YISSAH V'LO YASHMI'A BACHUTZ KOLO ("He will not shout nor cry out nor raise the sound of his voice in the street.")

20. KANEH RATZUTZ LO YISHBOR UFISHTAH CHEHAH LO YECHABENAH LE-EMET YOTZI MISHPAT ("A bruised reed he will not break nor a smoldering wick will he snuff out") until Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach leads mishpat (justice) to victory.

21. And in his Name, HaGoyim will put their tikvah (hope)  [YESHAYAH 42:2-3].  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEN DOVID AND BA'AL-ZIBBUL

22. Then a man, blind and mute, who was possessed by shedim, was brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach administered refu'ah to him, so that the mute man was able to speak and to see.

23. And all the multitudes were amazed and they were saying, "Surely this is not the Ben Dovid (Moshiach), is he?" REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON LASHON HORAH AND ALSO ON CHILLUL HASHEM

24. But, having heard this, the Perushim said, "This one does not cast out shedim except by Ba'al-zibbul, the Sar HaShedim (the Prince of Demons)."

25. But knowing their thoughts, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Every malchut that is divided against itself is made desolate, and every ir (city) and  bais (house) that is divided against itself will not stand.

26. And if Hasatan casts out Hasatan, he is divided against himself.  How, therefore, will the Malchut Hasatan stand?

27. And if I by Ba'al-zibbul cast out the shedim, by whom do your banim (sons) cast them out? Therefore, they will be your shofetim (judges).

28. But if by the Ruach Hakodesh I [Moshiach] cast out the shedim, then upon you the Malchut Hashem has arrived.

29. Or how is someone able to enter the Bayit haGibbor (the house of the strong man) and confiscate his furnishings unless he binds the Gibbor (strong man) first. Then he will plunder the Bayit haGibbor.

30. The one not with me (Moshiach) is against me (anti-Moshiach).  And the one not gathering with me scatters.

31. Therefore, I say to you, every chet (sin) and gidduf (blasphemy) will be forgiven men, but whoever commits Chillul Hashem (desecration of the Name) against the Ruach Hakodesh will not be forgiven.

32. And whoever speaks a word against the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) will be granted selicha (forgiveness), but whoever speaks against the Ruach Hakodesh, selicha (forgiveness) will be granted him neither in the Olam Hazeh nor in the Olam Haba.

33. Either make the aitz (tree) tov (good) and its p'ri (fruit) will be tov, or make the aitz nishchat (corrupt) and its p'ri will be rah; for by its p'ri the aitz is known.

34. You yeladim of nechashim, how are you able to l'deber tovot (speak good things), for out of the abundance of the lev (heart) the mouth speaks.

35. The ish tov (good man) out of the good otsar (treasure) brings forth good; and the ish rah out of the evil otsar brings forth evil.

36. But I say to you, that for every careless lashon horah (evil speech) that men speak, they will be called to account on the Yom HaDin (the Day of Judgment).

37. For by your dvarim you will be pronounced tzodek (righteous), and by your dvarim you will be chiyev (pronounced guilty, condemned).  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE SIGN OF YONAH

38. Then some of the Sofrim and Perushim answered Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Rabbi, we desire to see an ot (miraculous sign) from you."

39. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, "Dor rah um'naef (an evil and adulterous generation) seeks for a miraculous ot (sign), but no ot will be given it except the ot of Yonah HaNavi.

40. For just as Yonah was in the belly of the fish SHLOSHAH YAMIM U'SHLOSHAH LAILAH (`three days and three nights,` YONAH 1:17), so will be Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) in the heart of the earth SHLOSHAH YAMIM U'SHLOSHAH LAILOT (three days and three nights).

41. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the Mishpat * with this generation and they will condemn it, for the men of Nineveh made teshuva at the preaching of Yonah, and, hinei, something much greater than Yonah is here.

42. The Queen of the South will be made to stand up alive at the Mishpat with this generation and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the chochmah of Shlomo and, hinei, something much greater than Solomon is here.

43. Now when the ruach hatameh (unclean spirit) goes out from the man, it goes through dry places seeking a manoach (resting place) and it does not find one.

44. Then it says, Into my haunt I will return from where I came out.  And having come out, it finds the bais standing empty, having been swept and having been put beseder (in order).

45. Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other ruchot more evil than itself and, having entered the residence, it sets up house there and the last state of that man has become worse than the first.  Thus it will be with this evil generation also."

46. While he was still speaking to the multitudes, hinei, Moshiach's Em and achim stood outside, seeking to speak with him.

47. And someone said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Hinei! Your Em and your achim have stood outside seeking to speak with you."

48. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to the one speaking with him, "Who is my em and who are my achim?"

49. And stretching out his hand upon his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Hinei, my em and my achim.

50. For whoever does the ratson (will) of Avi sh'baShomayim (see Mt.6:10; 26:39), he is my ach and achot and em." *

## Matthew 13

1. On that day, having gone out of the bais, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sat beside the lake.

2. And many multitudes gathered together to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach so that he got into a sirah (boat) to sit down, and the entire multitude stood along the shore.

3. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them many things in meshalim (parables), saying "Hinei! The Sower went out to sow [seeds].

4. And  while he sowed, on the one hand, this [seed] fell along the road, and, the birds having come, devoured them.

5. And others fell upon the rocky places, where there is not much soil, and immediately it sprouts on account of the lack of the soil's depth.

6. And when the shemesh arose, the zera (seed) was scorched, and because it did not have a root, it withered.

7. And others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.

8. But others fell on the good ground, and they yielded fruit: the one, one hundred, the other, sixty, the other, thirty.

9. The one having ears, let him hear!"

10. And, approaching, the talmidim said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Why in meshalim (parables) are you speaking to them?"

11. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, "Because to you it has been granted to know the razi'im (mysteries) of the Malchut HaShomayim, but to those it has not been granted.

12. For whoever has, [more] will be given to him,and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him (see Mt.25:14-29).

13.  For this reason in meshalim I am speaking to them, for while seeing they do not see, and [while] hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

14.  And in them is fulfilled the nevu'ah (prophecy) of Yeshayah, saying, SHIM'U SHAMO'A V'AL TAVINU UREU RA'O V'AL TEIDA'U ("In hearing you will hear and by no means understand, and seeing you will see and by no means perceive").

15. HASHMEIN LEV HA'AM HAZEH V'AZNAV HACHBEID V'EINAV HASHA, PEN YIREH V'EINAV UVE'AZNAV YISHMAH U'LEVAVO YAVIN, V'SHAV N'RAFAH LOH.  ("For the heart of this people has been made dull, and with [their] ears they are hard of hearing, and their eyes are shut, lest they see with the their eyes and with [their] ears they hear, and with the lev (heart) they understand and they turn and I will give them refu'ah [healing]," YESHAYAH 6:9-10)

16.  But ashrey (happy, blessed) are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.

17. For truly I say to you that many Nevi'im and tzaddikim  desired to see what you see, and they did not see [it], and to hear what you hear, and they did not hear it. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH EXPLAINS THE MASHAL OF THE SOWER AND THE MESIRAT NEFESH (DEVOTION) NECESSARY TO ENTER THE MALCHUT HASHEM

18. "You, therefore, listen to the mashal of the sower.

19. When anyone hears the Dvar HaMalchut and does not understand it, haRah (the Evil one) comes and seizes that which was sown in his lev (heart). This is the zera (seed) sown along the path.

20. And the zera sown upon the rocky places is the person listening to the Dvar Hashem and immediately with simcha receives it.

21. Yet he has no root in himself but is short-lived, and when ES TZARAH * comes or persecution on account of the Dvar Hashem, immediately he ceases being a ma'amin Meshichi (Messianic believer) and becomes meshummad (apostate), falling away and giving up the [true Orthodox Jewish] faith.

22.   And the [zera] sown among the thorns is the one hearing the dvar (word), and the rogez HaOlam Hazeh (the anxiety of this age, DEVARIM 28:65) and the deceit of riches, chokes the Dvar Hashem and it becomes unfruitful.

23. And the zera sown upon the adamah hatovah (the good ground), this is the one who hears the Dvar Hashem and, understanding [it], indeed bears p'ri and, one produces a hundred, the other sixty, the other thirty."  ANOTHER MASHAL

24. Another mashal Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed before them, saying, "The Malchut HaShomayim is like a man sowing zera tov (good seed) in his field.

25. But while men slept, his oyev (enemy) came and oversowed weeds in between the wheat and went away.

26. But when the wheat sprouted and produced p'ri, then the weeds also appeared.

27. So the servants of the Ba'al Bayit said to him, `Adoneinu, did you not sow zera tov (good seed) in your field?  How then does it have weeds?

28. And he said to them, An oyev did this.  So the servants say to him,`Do you want us to go and pull them all?

29. But he says, No, lest gathering the weeds you should uproot the wheat together with them.

30. Permit both to grow together until the katzir (harvest); and in time of the katzir, I will say to the kotzerim (reapers), "Collect first the weeds, and bind them into bundles to burn them. But the wheat gather into my barn." *  


 ANOTHER MASHAL

31. Another mashal Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed before them, saying, "The Malchut HaShomayim is like a mustard seed, which a man, taking, sowed in his field.

32. This which is indeed less than all the zera'im (seeds), but when it grows, it is larger than the garden vegetables and it becomes an aitz (tree), so that the OF HASHOMAYIM (the birds of heaven, IYOV 35:11) come and dwell in its branches." ANOTHER MASHAL

33. Another mashal Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to them. "The Malchut HaShomayim is like se'or (leaven), which having taken, a woman hid in shalosh (three) satas of wheat flour until the whole was leavened."

34. All these things Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke in mashalim to the multitudes.  And apart from mashalim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not speak to them,

35. so that might be fulfilled what was spoken through the Navi, saying, EFT'CHA V'MASHAL PI A'VIAH CHIDOT MINI-KEDEM ("I will open my mouth  with parables, I  will utter things having been hidden from the foundation of the world," TEHILLIM 78:2)

36.  Then having sent away the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came into the bais (house).  And Moshiach's talmidim approached him, saying, `Explain to us the mashal of the weeds of the field.`

37. And answering, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, `The Sower of the zera tov is the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach).

38. The field is HaOlam Hazeh.  And the zera tov, the good seed, these are the Bnei HaMalchut, and the weeds, these are the bnei haRah (sons of the Evil one, Bereshis 3:15).

39. And the Oyev (the Enemy) sowing them is Hasatan.  And the Katzir (Harvest), this is the Kets HaOlam (the end of the age).   And the kotzerim (reapers, harvesters) are malachim (angels).

40.  As the weeds are pulled up and gathered and are consumed with Aish (Fire), so also it will be at the Kets HaOlam.

41. The Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) will send forth his malachim, and they will pull up and gather out of the Moshiach's Malchut all the things making meshummad (apostate) and the ones who are without Torah and antinomian.

42. And Moshiach's malachim will throw them into the furnace of Aish; there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.

43. Then the tzaddikim will shine as the shemesh in the Malchut of their Father.  The one having ears, let him hear.

44. The Malchut HaShomayim is like otzar (treasure) hidden in the field, which, having found, a man hid.  And from the simcha he experienced, he goes away and sells everything which he has and buys that field.

45. Again, the Malchut HaShomayim is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.

46. And having found one precious pearl, he went away and liquidated everything he had and acquired it.

47. Again, the Malchut HaShomayim is like a reshet (net) having been cast into the lake, a reshet collecting and gathering dagim (fish) of all descriptions,

48. which, when this reshet (net) was filled, they hoisted it upon the shore, sat down, collected the tov into a creel, and the rah, they threw out.

49. Thus it will be at the Kets HaOlam Hazeh.  The malachim will go out and they will separate the resha'im from among the tzaddikim.

50. And they will throw the resha'im into the furnace of Aish.  In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

51. Did you understand all these things?" They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Ken."

52. So Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Therefore, every sofer (scribe, Torah-teacher) who becomes a talmid of the Malchut HaShomayim is like a man [who is] a Ba'al Bayit, who takes out of his otzar (treasure), chadashot (new things) and also yeshanot (old things)."

53. And it came about when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finished these meshalim, that he went away from there.  TAKING OFFENSE AT REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

54. And having come into Moshiach's shtetl, he began ministering as a moreh (teacher) in their shul, so they were amazed and said, "From where did this chochmah come to this one, this chochmah and these moftim (miracles/wonders/omens)?

55. Is this not the ben hanaggar (the carpenter's son)?  Is not his Em called Miryam? And are not his achim Ya'akov, Yosef, Shimon and Y'hudah?

56. And are not his achayot (sisters) with us? From where, therefore, came to this one all these things?"

57. And they were taking offense at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "A Navi (prophet) is not dishonored except in his hometown and in his bais."

58. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not accomplish in that place many moftim, because of their lack of emunah and bittachon.

## Matthew 14

1. At that time reports about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came to the ears of Herod the Tetrarch.

2. And he said to his servants, "This one is Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva.  He has come up from the Techiyas HaMesim (the resurrection of the dead) and for this reason the moftim (wonders) are working in him."

3. For Herod had Yochanan arrested and bound him and threw him in the beit hasohar (prison), on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.

4. For Yochanan kept on saying to him, "It is asur (impermissible/ forbidden) for you to have her."

5. And [although] Herod was desiring to kill Yochanan, he feared the crowd, because they considered Yochanan a Navi.

6. Now at the yom huledet (birthday) celebration of Herod, it came about that the daughter of Herodias danced before them and Herod was pleased.

7. Herod, therefore, with a shevu'ah (an oath), promised to give to her whatever she might ask.

8.  So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, "Give to me here upon a serving tray the rosh (head) of Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva."

9. And, although grieving, the king commanded [it] to be given, on account of the shevu'ot (oaths) and the fellow guests.

10. And he sent and had Yochanan beheaded in the beit hasohar.

11. And the rosh of Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva was brought upon a serving tray, and it was presented to the girl and she presented it to her mother.

12. And Yochanan's talmidim approached and carried away the chalal (dead man) and buried him, and they went and reported [it] to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  REBBE MOSHIACH'S TISH AND THE "MANNA" FROM SHOMAYIM SERVED AT HIS FARBRENGEN (INSPIRATIONAL GATHERING)

13. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard [this], he withdrew from there in a sirah (boat) to a desolate place by himself.  And when the multitudes heard [this], they followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach by land from the arim (towns).

14. And having gone out, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw a great multitude, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach felt rachamanut (compassion) for them and administered refu'ah (healing) to their cholim.

15.  Now when erev (evening) came, Moshiach's talmidim came to him, saying, "This place is desolate and the time is late. Dismiss the multitude, so that, having gone into the arim, they may buy for themselves okhel (food)."

16. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "They have no need to go away. You yourselves give them something to eat."

17. But Moshiach's talmidim say to him, "We do not have here anything except chamesh (five) loaves and dagim (fish), only shenayim (two)."

18. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Bring them here to me."

19. And having commanded the multitudes to recline on the grass and having taken the chamesh loaves and the shnei hadagim, and having looked up to Shomayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said a beracha over the okhel, and having offered the betzi'at halechem (the breaking of the bread), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave the lechem to the talmidim, and Moshiach's talmidim served the lechem to the multitudes.

20.  And everyone ate and they were satisfied, and they took away shirayim (leftovers), shneym asar (twelve) baskets full.

21.  And the ones eating were about chamesh elafim (five thousand) men, apart from the women and children. 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL MOFET (MIRACLE WORKER)

22. And immediately Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach compelled the talmidim to board a sirah (boat) and to go on ahead of him to the other side until he might send away the multitudes.

23. And having sent away the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went up to the mountain by himself to daven. Now when erev had come, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was alone there.

24. Now the sirah (boat), being tossed by the waves (for the wind was against them), was by this time many stadia distant from the land.

25. Now in the fourth watch of the night, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came towards them, walking on the lake.

26. But Moshiach's talmidim, having seen him walking on the lake, were terribly shaken, saying, "It is a ruach refa'im (an apparition)!"   And from pachad (terror) they cried out.

27. And immediately Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to them, saying, "Chazak! Ani hu. (I am He.) Do not be afraid."

28.  And Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Adoni, if it is really you, command me to come to you al p'nei hamayim (on the surface of the waters)."

29. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Boh!"  And having gone down from the sirah (boat), Kefa walked al p'nei hamayim (on the surface of the waters) and came towards Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

30. And seeing the strong wind, Kefa was afraid, and having begun to sink, Kefa cried out, saying, "Gevalt! Adoni, hoshieini!"("L-rd, save me!")

31. And immediately Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having stretched out (his) hand, took hold of Kefa and says to him, "One of little emunah, why did you doubt?"

32. And as they were going up into the sirah (boat), the wind became still.

33.  And the ones in the sirah (boat) fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "In emes (truth), you are the Ben HaElohim!"

34. And having crossed over, they came onto the land at Gennesaret.

35. And having recognized him, the men of that place sent into all the surrounding region around, and they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach all the cholim,

36. and they were appealing to him that they might touch even the Moshiach's tzitzit on his garment, and all who did, received Moshiach's refu'ah (healing). [Yeshayah 53:5]

## Matthew 15

1. Then Perushim and Sofrim (rabbonim) from Yerushalayim approach Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying,

2. "Why do your talmidim transgress the Masoret HaZekenim (the Tradition of the Elders)?  For they do not do the netilat yadayim (ritual of the washing of the hands) before meals."

3. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, in reply to them, said, "Why [do] also you transgress the mitzvat Hashem on account of your own masoret (tradition)? *

4. For Hashem has said, KABED ES AVICHA V'ES IMMECHA ("honor your father and your mother," SHEMOT 20:12; DEVARIM 5:16), and M'KALEL 'AVIV V'IMMO MOT YUMAT(literally, "the one cursing to die he must die, "SHEMOT 21:17; VAYIKRA 20:9).

5. But you say, `Whoever says to his father or his mother, whatever support you might have had from me, [it is] a gift [i.e. korban, dedicated to G-d],`

6. by no means does [anyone who says this] honor his father.  And you nullify the Dvar Hashem on account of your masoret.            REBBE,MELECH HAMOSHIACH REBUKES VAIN AVODAH AND POINTS TO THE SOURCE OF TIFLUT

7.  You tzevu'im (hypocrites), well did Yeshayah make a nevu'ah (prophesy) concerning you, saying,

8. YA'AN KI NIGASH HAAM HAZEH BEFIV U'VISHFATAV KI-B'DUNI V'LIBO RICHAK MIMENI VA'TEHI YIRA'TAM OTI MITZVAT ANASHIM MELUMADAH ("This people with their lips honor Me, but their heart is far away from Me,

9. and in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the mitzvot of men," YESHAYAH 29:13.)"

10. And having summoned the multitude, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Listen and understand!

11. It is not the thing entering into the mouth that makes the man tameh (unclean), but the thing going out from the mouth--this makes the man tameh."

12. Then Moshiach's talmidim approached and say to him, "Do you know that the Perushim took offense when they heard [this] word?"

13. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, in reply, said, "Every plant which Avi sh'baShomayim did not plant will be uprooted.

14. Leave them. They are blind morei derech (guides/teachers) of [the] blind. And if the ivver (blind man) leads the iverim (blind), both will fall into a pit."

15. And Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Explain to us the mashal."

16. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said,  "Are you still devoid of binoh (understanding)?"

17. Do you not know that everything which enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and passes into a latrine?

18. But the things coming out from the mouth come out from the lev (heart), and that makes the man tameh (unclean).

19. For out of the lev comes evil makhshavot (thoughts): retzichot (murders), ni'ufim (adulteries), zenunim (fornications), genevot (thefts), eduyot sheker (false testimonies), giddufim (revilements).

20. These are the things making the man tameh, but eating with hands lacking the netilat yadayim (ritual of the washing of the hands--see Mt. 27:24), this does not make the man tameh."
 THE EMUNAH OF THE GOYIM IN SPITE OF THE MECHITZAH-SOREG BARRIER OF GENDER AND NATIONALITY SEPARATING THEM FROM REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

21. And having gone from that place, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach withdrew into the districts of Tzor and Tzidon.

22. And--hinei--a woman from Canaan came out from those regions, and was shouting, "Have mercy on me, Adoni, Ben Dovid!  my bat (daughter) is in torment possessed by shedim."

23. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not answer her a word.  And Moshiach's talmidim having approached, were asking him, saying, "Send her away, for she shouts after us."

24. But, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, "I was not sent except to the Seh Oveid HaBeth Yisroel (the Lost Sheep of the House of Israel)."

25. But she came and fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Adoni, azreini"("L-rd, help me").

26. But, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, "It is not good to take the lechem of the Banim and throw it to the kelevim (dogs)."

27.  But she said, "Ken, Adoni, but even the kelevim eat the crumbs falling from the tish (table) of their masters."

28. Then, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, "O woman, great [is] your emunah.  Let it be done for you as you wish."  And the bat (daughter) of her was given refu'ah (healing) at that very hour.

29. And having passed over from that place, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came beside Lake Kinneret, and having gone up the mountain, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting there.

30. And great multitudes approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having with them pisechim (lame), iverim (blind), crippled, mute people, and many others, and they laid them at Moshiach's feet, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave the cholim refu'ah.

31. The result was that the multitude was astounded, witnessing mute people speaking, cripples made whole, the pisechim (lame) walking, and the iverim (blind people) seeing, and they gave kavod to Elohei Yisroel.  REBBE MOSHIACH'S TISH AND THE "MANNA" FROM SHOMAYIM SERVED AT HIS SECOND FARBRENGEN

32. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having summoned his talmidim, said, "I have rachamanut (compassion) for the multitudes, for already shloshah yamim (three days) they remain with me and they do not have anything they may eat, and I do not want to send them away famished, lest they might faint on the way."

33. And Moshiach's talmidim say to him, "From where bamidbar (in the wilderness) is there enough lechem for us to feed such a vast multitude?"

34. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "How much lechem, how many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Sheva (seven), and a few dagim (fish)."

35. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave the command for the multitude to recline on the ground,

36. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the loaves numbering sheva and the dagim, and making a beracha, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach offered the betzi'at halechem (the breaking of the bread) and served them to the talmidim, and Moshiach's talmidim served them to the multitudes.

37. And everyone ate and they were satisfied, and the shirayim (leftovers) were numbering sheva baskets full.

38. And the ones eating were arba'at elafim (four thousand) men, not counting nashim and yeladim.

39. And having sent away the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach embarked in the sirah (boat), and came to the region of Magadan.

## Matthew 16

1. And the Perushim and Tzedukim approached, to test Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, asking him to present them with an ot (sign) from Shomayim.

2. But in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "When it is erev, you say, `It will be fair weather, for the sky is fiery red.`

3.  And in the boker (morning), `There will be stormy weather today, for the sky is overcast fiery red and threatening.` You know enough to distinquish the signs of the appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the times.

4. A dor rah um'naef (an evil and adulterous generation) demands an ot (sign), and no ot will be given it except the ot of Yonah HaNavi."  And having left them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went away. 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH WARNS ABOUT TEACHING THAT PUFFS UP WITH BLINDING GA'AVAH (PRIDE)

5.  When the Moshiach's talmidim arrived at the other side, they had forgotten to take lechem.

6. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Take special precaution against the se'or (leaven) of the Perushim and Tzedukim."

7. But they began reasoning among themselves, saying, "We took no lechem."

8. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, aware of their makhshavot (thoughts), said, "You men of little emunah, why do you reason among yourselves that you have no lechem?

9. "Do you not yet understand or remember the chamesh loaves of the chamesh elafim, and how many baskets full you took up,

10. "or the shevah loaves of the arba'at elafim, and how many large baskets full you took up?

11. "How is it that you do not chap (grasp mentally) that I did not speak to you concerning lechem?  But beware of the se'or of the Perushim and Tzedukim."

12. Then Moshiach's talmidim understood that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not say to beware of the se'or of the lechem, but of the se'or (leaven) of the Perushim and the Tzedukim's teaching.  THE ANI MA'AMIN OF THE CORRECT (ORTHODOX JEWISH) EMUNAH (FAITH), THE EMUNAH OF THE TRUE DAT HAYEHUDIT

13. Now, having arrived in the district of Caesarea Philippi, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began asking his talmidim, saying, "Who do men say that the Ben HaAdam is?"

14. And Moshiach's talmidim said, "Some say `Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva,` and others, `Eliyahu,` but still others, `Yirmeyah or one of the Nevi'im.`"

15. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "But you, who do you consider me to be?"

16. And, Shimon Kefa said in reply, "You are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the Ben Elohim Chayyim!"

17.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to him, "Ashrey atah (happy are you), Shimon Bar Yonah, because basar vadahm (flesh and blood) did not reveal this to you, but Avi b'Shomayim.

18. And I also say to you that you are Shimon Kefa [rock] and upon this rock I will build my Kehillah (the Community of Moshiach) and the sha'arei She'ol (gates of She'ol) shall not overpower it.

19.  I will give you the maftechot Malchut HaShomayim (keys of the Kingdom of Heaven); and whatever you shall bind as asur (prohibited) on ha'aretz shall be bound as asur (prohibited) in Shomayim, and whatever you shall loose as mutar (permitted) on ha'aretz shall be loosed as mutar (permitted) in Shomayim."

20. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave the command to his talmidim that they should tell no one that he was the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEGINS TO GIVE THE NEVU'AH (PROPHECY) OF HIS COMING MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM

21. From that point he began to explain to his talmidim that it was necessary that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach go to Yerushalayim, and suffer many things from the Zekenim (Elders), and the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) and the Sofrim (Scribes) and be killed and undergo the Techiyas HaMesim on the Yom HaShlishi (the Third Day).

22.  And Kefa took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Chas v'shalom (G-d forbid!) Adoni, this shall never happen to you!"

23.  But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach turned and said to Kefa, "Get behind me, Hasatan!  You are a michshol (stumbling block) to me; for you are not setting your mind on the divrei Elohim (the things of G-d), but the things of bnei Adam!"    THE BITTUL HAYESH (ABANDONMENT OF SELF) MOSHIACH COMMANDS

24. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him turn in hinnazrut (self-denial), and take up his aitz haKorban (tree of sacrifice), and follow me.

25.  For whoever wishes to save his nefesh shall lose it; but whoever loses his nefesh on account of me [Moshiach], shall find it.

26. For what will a man be benefited if he acquires the whole world and forfeits his nefesh, or what will a man give in exchange for his neshamah?

27. For the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) is about to come in the kavod of his Av with his malachim and will then recompense every man according to his ma'asim (deeds).

28. Omein, I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Bias of the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) coming in his Malchut."

## Matthew 17

1. And after shisha yamim (six days), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan his brother, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach brings them up to a high mountain privately.

2. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was transfigured * before them, and Moshiach's face shone like the shemesh, and his garments became brilliant like the ohr.

3. And--hinei!--there appeared before them Moshe and Eliyahu conferring with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

4. And Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Adoni, it is good for us to be here.  If you wish, I will make shalosh succot (three tabernacles) here: one for you, and one for Moshe, and one for Eliyahu."

5.  While he was speaking--hinei!--a brightly shining anan (cloud) overshadowed them, and--hinei!--a bat kol (a Divine voice) out of he anan was saying, "This is my Ben ahuvi (beloved Son) with whom I am well-pleased.   Listen to him."

6. And having heard this, the talmidim fell on their faces and were filled with pachad (fear, terror).

7. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came to them, and touched them, and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."

8. And lifting their eyes, they saw no one, except only Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach himself, alone.

9. And as Moshiach's talmidim were coming down from the mountain, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave them this command, saying, "Tell the mar'eh (vision) to no one until the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) has undergone the Techiyas HaMesim."

10. And Moshiach's talmidim asked him, saying, "Why then do the Sofrim say that it is necessary for Eliyahu to come first?"

11. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply,  "Eliyahu does indeed have his Bias (Coming) and will restore all things.

12.  But I say to you, that Eliyahu already came, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they willed (Mt. 6:10). So also the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) is about to suffer by them."

13. Then the Moshiach's talmidim understood that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to them about Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva. 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH HEALS THE BOCHUR POSSESSED BY SHEDIM

14. And when they came to the multitude, a man came up to rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, falling down before him.

15. And the man said, "Adoni, grant rachamim (mercy) on this ben (son) of mine, for he is an epileptic, and suffers horribly; for often he falls into the aish, and often into the mayim.

16. And I brought him to your talmidim, and they could not give him refu'ah."

17. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, "O perverted generation without emunah, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me."

18. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rebuked it, and the shed (demon/evil spirit) came out of him, and the bochur received his refu'ah that hour.

19. Then the talmidim came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach privately, and said, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"

20. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "On account of your little emunah, for, omein, I say to you, if you have emunah as a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, `Move from here,`and it shall be moved; and nothing shall be impossible for you."

21. But these kinds, i.e. kinds of mazikim (malicious spirits), do not come out except by tefillah and tzom. MOSHIACH'S SECOND NEVU'AH OF HIS INNUYIM AND THE KAVOD TO FOLLOW

22.  And as they were gathering together in the Galil, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "The Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) is about to be handed over, even betrayed, into the hands of bnei  Adam.

23.  and they will kill him, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will undergo the Techiyas HaMesim on the Yom HaShlishi."   And Moshiach's talmidim were deeply moved with agmat nefesh.

24. And when they had come to  K'far-Nachum, those who collected the two-drachma tax approached Kefa, and said, "Does your rebbe not pay the two-drachma tax?"

25. Kefa said, "Ken."  And when Kefa came into the bais (house), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach anticipated Kefa with this question, "What think you, Shimon? From whom do the melechei ha'aretz (kings of the earth) collect customs or poll tax, from their banim (sons) or from zarim (strangers)?"

26. And upon Kefa's saying, "From zarim," Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Kefa, "Veha raya (consequently), the banim are patur (exempt, free).

27.  But, lest we give them offense, go to the yam (sea), and cast in a hook, and take the first dag (fish) that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a stater (coin). Take that and give it to them for you and me."

## Matthew 18

1. At that time, the talmidim approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Who then is greatest in the Malchut HaShomayim?"

2. And having called a yeled to himself, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach set him before them,

3. and said, "Omein, I say to you, unless you change inwardly and have a complete turn-around and become like yeladim, you shall never enter the Malchut HaShomayim.

4. Therefore, whoever humbles himself as this yeled, he is the greatest in the Malchut HaShomayim.

5. And whoever receives one such yeled in my Name receives me [Moshiach].

6. But whoever causes a michshol (stumbling block) for one of these little ones, who have emunah in me, it is better for him that a heavy millstone be hung around his neck, and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea.

7. Oy l'Olam (Woe to the World) because of its michsholim (stumbling blocks)!  For it is inevitable that michsholim come; but oy to that man through whom the michshol comes.

8. And if your hand or your foot causes a michshol for you, cut it off, and throw it from you.  It is better for you to enter Chayyim crippled or as one of the pisechim (lame), than, having two hands and two feet, to be cast into the Aish Olam (Eternal Fire).

9. And if your eye causes a michshol for you, pluck it out and throw it from you.  It is better for you to enter Chayyim one-eyed than, having two eyes, to be cast into the Gehinnom HaAish.

10. See to it that you do not look down on one of these little ones, for I say to you that their malachim which are in Shomayim continually behold the face of Avi sh'baShomayim (my Father who is in Heaven).

11.  

12. What do you think?  If any man owns a hundred kevasim (sheep) and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hillsides and go and search for the one that is straying?*

13. And if it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he has more simcha (joy) over it than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.

14. Thus it is not the ratson Hashem, the will of your Av sh'baShomayim, that one of these little ones perish.  HOW SIN IS BOUND AND SETTLED IN THE BET DIN OF MOSHIACH'S KEHILLAH IF YOU HAVE A TVIA (GRIEVANCE) AGAINST YOUR ACH B'MOSHIACH

15. And if your ach b'Moshiach sins against you, go and reprove him in private, just between the two of you; if he listens to you, you have gained your ach b'Moshiach.

16. But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more achim b'Moshiach with you, so that by the PI SHNAYIM SHLOSHAH EDIM (`by the mouth of two or three witnesses,` DEVARIM 19:15) every word shall be established.

17. But if he refuses to listen to them, speak to the shtiebel kehillah, and if he even refuses to hear the kehillah, let him be to you as the Goy and the moches (tax-collector).

18. Omein, I say to you, whatever you bind as asur (prohibited) on ha'aretz  will have been bound in Shomayim, and whatever you permit as mutar on ha'aretz is mutar (permitted) in Shomayim.

19. Again, omein I say to you, that if two of you will be in agreement about anything on ha'aretz that you petition for, it will be done for them by Avi sh'baShomayim.

20.  For where two or three form a kehillah in my name [Moshiach], there I am in the midst of them."                         *A MASHAL OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ABOUT UNFORGIVENESS

21. Then, having approached, Kefa said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Adoni, how often will my brother sin against me and I will grant to him selicha (forgiveness)? As many as shevah (seven) times?"

22. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Kefa, "I do not say to you as many as shevah, but as many as shivim (seventy) times shevah. MOSHIACH'S MIDRASH ON HIS TEFILLAH MT. 6:12

23. Therefore, the Malchut HaShomayim is like a melech, a king, who wished to settle accounts with his servants.

24. And having begun to settle accounts, a debtor owing ten thousand talents was brought to the melech.

25. And, as this debtor did not have the means to pay what was owed his adon, the king commanded that he and his wife and children and everything he possessed be sold and the debt repaid.

26. Therefore, crying out for rachamim and falling down before him, the servant said, `Have zitzfleisch (patience) with me and I will pay back to you everything!`

27. And out of rachamanut (compassion), the adon of that servant pardoned him and forgave the choiv (debt).

28. Then the debtor went out and found one of the other fellow servants who happened to owe the debtor one hundred denarii. And seizing and choking the servant, the debtor said, `Repay what you owe me!`

29. And, falling down, the servant said to the debtor,`Have zitzfleisch (patience) with me and I will repay you.`

30. But the debtor was not willing. Then the debtor went and threw the servant into the beit hasohar (prison) until he should repay the debt.

31. Therefore, when the man's fellow servants saw what had taken place, they grieved greatly and they went and reported to their adon all that had taken place.

32. Then having summoned the debtor, his adon said to him, `Wicked servant, all that choiv (debt) I forgave you, because you begged me.

33. Was it not necessary also for you to have rachamim (mercy) upon your fellow servant?`

34. And in charon af (wrath), his adon handed the debtor over to the keepers of the beit hasohar until the debtor should repay the entire debt.

35. Thus also Avi sh'baShomayim will do to you, unless you grant selicha (forgiveness), each one to his brother from your lev (heart)."

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finished these words, he departed from the Galil and came into the regions of Yehudah east of the Yarden River.

2. And a great multitude followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach administered refu'ah to them there.

3. And the Perushim approached him, and to test him, they asked Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Is it mutar (permissible) for a man to give a get to his wife for any and every reason?"

4. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, "Have you not read that the Boreh (Creator, G-d) bereshis (in the beginning) created them zachar (male) and nekevah (female) [BERESHIT 1:27, 5:2]?"

5. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Because of this, YA'AZAV ISH ES AVIV V'ES IMMO V'DAVAK B'ISHTO V'HAYU L'VASAR ECHAD ("a man will leave his father and his mother and will be joined to his isha (wife), and the two will be one flesh," BERESHIT 2:24).

6. So they are no longer shnayim (two) but basar echad (one flesh).  Therefore, whatever Hashem joined together, let no man divide asunder."

7. They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Why then did Moshe Rabbenu give the mitzva to give the get, the sefer keritut (bill of divorcement), and send her away?"

8. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Moshe, because of your hardness of heart, permitted you to give the get to your wives; from bereshis (in the beginning), however, it was not this way.

9. But I [Moshiach] say to you that whoever, the case of zenut (fornication) being excepted, gives the get to his wife and marries another, is guilty of ni'uf (adultery)."

10. Moshiach's talmidim say to him, "If thus is the case of the man with the wife, it is not advantageous to marry."

11. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Not everyone is able to accept this divrei torah, but rather those to whom it has been given.

12. For there are sarisim (eunuchs) who from the womb of their Em were born thus, and there are sarisim who were made sarisim by men, and there are sarisim who make sarisim of themselves for the sake of the Malchut haShomayim.  The one able to receive this, let him receive this."  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON THE SUBJECT OF CHINUCH HABANOS

13. Then yeladim were brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach that he might place his hands on them and offer tefillos. However, Moshiach's talmidim rebuked them.

14. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Permit the yeladim to come to me, and forbid them not, *  for of such is the Malchut HaShomayim."  YELADIM RECEIVE THE BIRKAT REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

15. And having placed his hands on the yeladim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach departed from there. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND ONE OF THE BAALE-BATTIM OF YISROEL, WHO BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF PERCEPTION OF TRUE RICHES, PASSES BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE MOSHIACH'S S'MICHAH TO THE MINISTRY

16. And--hinei--one, having approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said, "Rebbe, what mitzva, what good may I do that I may have Chayyei Olam?"

17. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Why do you ask me about the good?  There is only One who is good.  But if you wish to enter into Chayyim (Life), do not fail to be shomer mitzvot."

18. He says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,  "Which mitzva?"  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "LO TIRTZACH, LO TINAF, LO TIGNOV, LO TA'ANEH V'REI'ACHAH AD SHAKER, KABEID ES A'VICHA V'ES IMMECHAH, V'AHAVTAH L'RE'ACHA KAMOCHA ("You shall not murder, commit adultery, steal, bear false witness;

19. honor your father and your mother, and You shall love your neighbor as yourself," SHEMOT 20:13 (13-16); DEVARIM 5:17-20; SHEMOT 20:12; DEVARIM 5:16; VAYIKRA 19:18.)

20. The bochur (young man) says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "I was shomer mitzvot and frum in all these things, so where do I still fall short?"

21. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "If you wish to be tamim (perfect), if you wish to have shelemut (perfection, completeness), then go and sell your possessions and give to the anyim (poor) and you will have otzar (treasure) in Shomayim. Then come and follow me."

22. But having heard the divrei Moshiach, the young man went away with agmat nefesh (grief), for he was having many possessions.

23. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, "Omein, I say to you that a rich person with difficulty will enter into the Malchut HaShomayim.

24. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to  go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the Malchut HaShomayim."

25. And when Moshiach's talmidim heard this, they were exceedingly astounded, saying, "Who then is able to receive the Yeshuat Eloheinu (Salvation of our G-d)?"

26. And having looked upon them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "With bnei Adam it is impossible; but with Hashem all things are possible."

27. Then Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Hinei! We have left everything and followed you [as Moshiach]!  Where does that leave us?"

28. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Omein, I say to you, that you, the ones having followed me, when the Bri'ah (Creation) becomes Chadasha (New), when the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) sits upon his Kisei Kavod (Throne of Glory), you also will sit upon the Shneym Asar Kisot (Twelve Thrones) judging the Shneym Asar Shivtei Yisroel (the Twelve Tribes of Israel).

29. And anyone who left bais or achim or achayot or Av or Em or banim or sadot (fields) on account of me (Moshiach) and my Name (Yehoshua), will receive a hundred times over and will inherit Chayyei Olam.

30. And many who are Rishonim (first ones) will be Acharonim (last ones), and the Acharonim, Rishonim."

## Matthew 20

1. "The Malchut HaShomayim is like a man, the Ba'al Bayit, who went out early in the boker (morning), to hire po'alim (workers) for his kerem (vineyard).

2. And having agreed with the po'alim to salary them a denarius for their day's pay, the Ba'al Bayit sent them into his kerem.

3. And having gone out around the third hour, the Ba'al Bayit saw others loitering in the marketplace,

4. and he said to those, `You go also into the kerem. And whatever is right, this is what your pay will be.'

5. And they left.  And again, having gone out around the sixth and the ninth hour, the Ba'al Bayit did the same thing.

6. And around the eleventh hour, having gone out, the Ba'al Bayit found others standing around, and he says to them,  `Why have you been standing here all the day not working?'

7. The idle workers say to the Ba'al Bayit, `Because no one hired us.` The Ba'al Bayit says to them, `You go also into the kerem.'

8. And when erev had come, another man, the owner of the kerem, says to his foreman, `Call the po'alim and give to them the wage, beginning with the acharonim and going to the rishonim.'

9. And the ones that came around the eleventh hour each received a denarius.

10. And when the rishonim came, they were under the impression that they would receive a larger sum; instead, they themselves each received a denarius.

11. And when they received the denarius, they were complaining against the Ba'al Bayit,

12. saying `These acharonim worked one hour, and you made them equal to us, the ones having endured the burden and the heat of the whole day.'

13. But the Ba'al Bayit said in reply to one of them, `Chaver, I am not cheating you.  Did you not agree that I would pay you the usual day's wage, a denarius?

14. Take what belongs to you, your denarius, and go.  But it is my ratson, my good pleasure, to give to this one who is last also what I gave to you.

15. Or is it not allowable for me to do what I wish with the things that are mine? Or do you look with a jealous 'ayin ra'ah upon my goodness?

16. Thus the Rishonim will be Acharonim, and the Acharonim will be Rishonim."  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS THIRD NEVU'AH CONCERNING HIS MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM

17. And going up to Yerushalayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the Shneym Asar Talmidim aside privately, and, on the way, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them,

18. "Hinei!  We are going up to Yerushalayim, and the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) will be handed over to the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim (scribes, Torah-teachers, or rabbonim), and they will condemn him to death.

19. And they will hand Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach over to the Goyim in order to mock and to whip and to hang him up pierced al Aitz (on the Tree), and on the Yom HaShlishi (Third Day) there will be Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim."
 ARE YOU ABLE TO SHARE MOSHIACH'S KOS?

20. Then the Em of Zavdai's banim, along with the sons, approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and, prostrating herself before him, she made a bakosha (request) of him.

21. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, "What do you wish?" She says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Say that these, my two banim, may sit, one on your right, the other on your left, in your (the Moshiach's) Malchut (Kingdom)."

22. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the Kos which I am about to drink?"  They say, "We are able."

23. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Indeed, you will drink my Kos, but to sit on the right and on the left of me, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my (Moshiach's) Av."

24. And having heard this, the Asarah (the Ten) became indignant about the two achim (brothers).

25. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having summoned them, said, "You know that those who have the rule over the Goyim domineer them like tyrants.

26. But it will not be thus among you. For whoever wishes to be gadol among you will become your mesharet (servant,minister). *

27. And whoever wishes among you to be rishon (first) will be your eved (servant)."

28. Just as the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) did not come to be served, to be ministered to, but to serve, to minister, and to give his neshamah, his nefesh, as a kofer (ransom) LARABBIM (`for the sake of many, `YESHAYAH 53:11). A MIRACLE: TWO JEWISH MEN LEARN TO SEE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEN DOVID

29. And, as they were going out from Yericho, a great multitude followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

30. And--hinei!--two ivrim (blind men), sitting beside the road, having heard that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is passing by, shouted, crying out, "Adoneinu, Ben Dovid, chaneinu, y'hi chase'd'cha aleinu" ("have mercy on us" TEHILLIM 33:22)!"

31. However, the crowd rebuked the two ivrim, that they be silent, but they shouted even more, saying "Chaneinu, Adoneinu Ben Dovid!"

32. And having stopped, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach called to them and said, "What do you wish that I should do for you?"

33. They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Adoneinu, that our eyes may be opened!"

34.  And having been filled with rachmei shomayim (heavenly mercy/compassion), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes were opened and they followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

## Matthew 21

1. When they came near to Yerushalayim and arrived at Beit-Pagey on the Mount of Olives, then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent two talmidim,

2. saying to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey having been tied and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.

3. "And if anyone should say to you anything, you say, `The Adon has need of them.' And he will send them immediately."

4. And this took place in order that might be fulfilled the thing spoken by the Navi (Prophet), saying:

5. IMRU L'BAT TZIYON! ("Tell the Daughter of Zion!")  "Hinei! Your Melech comes, ANI V'ROCHEV AL CHAMOR V'AL AYIR BEN ATONOT ("poor/humble and riding on a donkey and upon a colt, the foal of donkeys" YESHAYAH 62:11; ZECHARYAH 9:9).

6. And having accomplished just what Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had commanded them,

7. they brought the donkey and the colt and they put their garments upon them, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sat upon them.

8. And the very large multitudes spread out their garments on the road, and others were cutting lulavim from the trees, and were spreading them out on the road.

9. And the multitudes going before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and the multitudes following after Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach were crying out, saying, "HOSHAN NAH (`Save now`, TEHILLIM 118:25-26) to Ben Dovid!  BARUCH HABAH B'SHEM ADONAI!"  *Hoshannah in the Highest!"

10. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had entered into Yerushalayim, the whole city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?"

11. And the multitudes were saying, "This is Yehoshua HaNavi!  From Natzeret in the Galil."  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CLEANSES THE BEIS HAMIKDASH

12. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arrived at the Beis Hamikdash and expelled the ones selling and buying in the Beis Hamikdash.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach turned over the tishen (tables) of the machalifei hakesafim (money changers) and the chairs of those selling the yonim (doves).

13. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "It has been written, BEITI BEIT TEFILLAH YIKAREI ("My House shall be called a House of Prayer," YESHAYAH 56:7), but you are making it into a ME'ARAT PARITZIM ("den of robbers," YIRMEYAH 7:11)."

14. And iverim (blind persons) and pisechim (lame persons) came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in the Beis Hamikdash, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach administered refu'ah to them.

15. And the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim, having seen the niflaot which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach accomplished and the yeladim shouting in the Beis Hamikdash, "Hosha nah to the Ben Dovid," were indignant.

16. And they said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Do you hear what these are saying?"  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Ken.  Have you never read, MIPI OLELIM V'YONKIM YISSADETAH OZ ("From the lips of children and infants You ordained strength/praise," TEHILLIM 8:3[2])?"

17. And having left them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out of the city to Beit-Anyah (Bethany) and spent the night there.




 WHATEVER IS WITHOUT P'RI (FRUIT) IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS CURSED

18.  Now going up early into the city, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was hungry.

19. And observing the aitz te'enah (fig tree) on the way, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went up to it and found nothing on it, except leaves, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to it, "No longer from you will there ever be p'ri (fruit)!"  And the aitz te'enah (fig tree) withered then and there.

20. And observing this, the talmidim were astounded, saying, "How did the aitz te'enah instantly wither?"

21.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, "Omein, I say to you, if you have emunah and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the aitz te'enah, but also if you say to this mountain, `Be lifted up and be thrown into the sea,' it will happen."

22. And, when you daven, all things whatever you may with emunah make techinah (petition, supplication), with emunah you will receive.  THE SAMCHUT OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS QUESTIONED

23. And after Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had gone into the Beis Hamikdash, while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was bringing forth his torah, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim of the people approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "By what samchut (authority) do you do these things?  And who granted you this samchut?"

24. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, "I also will ask you a question, which, if you will tell me, I also will tell you by what samchut I do these things...

25. the tevilah in the mikveh mayim that Yochanan administered...it was from where, from Shomayim or from bnei Adam (the sons of Men)?" And they were discussing it among themselves, saying, "If we say, from Shomayim, he will say to us, `Why then do you not believe him?`

26. But if we say, `From bnei Adam,` we fear the multitude, for everyone considers Yochanan a Navi."

27. And in reply to him, they said, "We do not know."  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what samchut I do these things."


 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES A MASHAL THAT TEACHES TRUE TESHUVA

28. "What do you think?  A man had two banim (sons). And having approached the rishon (first), the man said, `Beni (my son), go today and work in the kerem (vineyard).`

29. But the first son said in reply, `I will not.`  But later, having changed his mind, he went.

30. And having approached the other son, the man spoke similarly. But the second son, in reply, said, `I will go, Adoni.`  Yet he did not go.

31. Which of the two did the ratson haAv (the will of the Father)? They say, "The rishon (the first)."  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Omein, I say to you, that the mochesim (tax-collectors) and the zonot (prostitutes) are going in ahead of you into the Malchut Hashem.

32. For Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva came to you in the Derech Tzidkat Hashem (Way of Righteousness), and you did not believe him.  But the mochesim and the zonot believed him.  But you, even after you saw, did not change your mind and believe him."  
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BECHOR (TEHILLIM 89:28): A MASHAL

33. "Listen to another mashal.  There was a man, a Ba'al Bayit, who planted a kerem (vineyard).  And he put a fence around it, and he dug a yekev (winepress) in it, and built a migdal (tower) and leased it to koremim (vine-keepers) and departed.

34. And when the time of the Katsir (Harvest) came, the Ba'al Bayit sent his servants to the koremim to receive the p'ri (fruit).

35. And the koremim, having seized his servants, this one they beat, another they killed, and another they stoned.

36. And the Ba'al Bayit sent other servants, more than the rishonim (firstones), and the koremim did the same thing to them.

37. Lemaskana (finally, at last), the Ba'al Bayit sent to the koremim his Ben, saying, `They will respect my Ben.`

38. And when the koremim saw the Ben, they said among themselves, "This is the Bechor (Firstborn), the Yoresh (Heir). Come, let us kill him and let us take possession of his bechorah (inheritance).

39. And having seized the Ben, they threw the Ben out of the kerem and they killed him.

40. Therefore, when the Ba'al HaKerem (Owner of the Vineyard) comes, what will he do to those koremim (vine-keepers)?"

41. They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Those resha'im (evildoers) the Ba'al HaKerem will bring to a terrible niftar (decease) and the Kerem the Ba'al HaKerem will lease to other koremim, who will render unto the Ba'al haKerem the P'RI B'ITO (`fruit in its season, `TEHILLIM 1:3)."

42. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Have you never heard in the Kitvei Hakodesh (Holy Scriptures), EVEN MA'ASU HABONIM HAY'TAH LEROSH PINAH;  MEI'ES HASHEM HAY'TAH ZOT, HI NIFLAT B'EINEINU ("The Stone which the Builders rejected, this one has become Head of the Corner; this came about from the L-rd, and it is marvelous in our eyes," TEHILLIM 118:22-23)?

43. For this reason, I say to you, the Malchut Hashem will be taken from you and it will be given to a people that produces its p'ri."

44. [And the one having fallen on this stone will be crushed; and on whom ever it falls it will crush him.]

45. And having heard Moshiach's mashal, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Perushim understood that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke about them.

46. And seeking to arrest him, they were afraid of the multitudes, vi-bahlt (since) the multitudes considered him a Navi.

## Matthew 22

1. And, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach again spoke in meshalim (parables) to them, saying,

2. "The Malchut HaShomayim is like a man, a Melech (King), who prepared a chassuna (wedding) feast for his Ben.

3. And the Melech sent out his servants to summon the Bnei haChuppah (wedding invitees--Mt.9:15) to the chassuna, and they did not want to come.

4. Again, the Melech sent out other servants, saying, `Tell the Bnei HaChuppah, the wedding invitees, "Hinei! My Seudah I have prepared, my oxen and fatten calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready: Come to the chassuna!"`

5. But the Bnei HaChuppah, the chassuna invitees, having treated it all as a mere trifle, departed, one to his farmer's field, one to his business;

6. meanwhile, the others seized the Mesharetim HaMelech (Ministers of the King) and abused them and killed them.

7.  So the Melech was angry and, having sent his armies, the King destroyed those ratzchaniyot (murderers), and their city he burned.

8. Then the King says to his ministers, `The chassuna is ready, but the invited ones were not worthy.

9. Therefore, go to the intercessions of the streets, and, whoever you find, invite as muzmanim (guests) to the chassuna.'

10. And having gone out to the highways, those ministers congregated everyone they found, rah and tov (evil and good), and the chassuna was filled with muzmanim (guests).

11. And the Melech, having entered to see the ones sitting bimesibba (reclining at tish), spotted there a man lacking the attire proper for the chassuna.

12. And the Melech says to him, `Chaver, how did you get in here, not having attire proper for the chassuna?' But the man had nothing to say.  *

13. Then the King said to the servants, `Bind him feet and hands and expell him into the outer choshech, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE YECHIDE SEGULAH (CHOSEN FEW)

14. For the invited ones are many, but the nivcharim (chosen ones) are few.'" REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS GAINSAYERS

15. Then, having departed, the Perushim took counsel together so that they might entrap Yehoshua in his own words.

16. And they are sending to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach their talmidim with the Herodians, saying, "Rabbi, we know that you are an ehrliche Yid (a good Jew) and of the Derech Hashem you give Divrei Torah in Emes, and you show no deference to flesh, for you are impartial toward bnei Adam.

17. Therefore, tell us what to you seems right:  is it mutar (permissible) to pay Poll tax to Caesar or not?"

18. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having known their rah (evil), said to them "Why do you test me, tzevu'im (hypocrites)?

19. Show me the coin of the Poll tax.  And they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a denarius.

20. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Whose image is this and whose title?"

21. They say to him "Caesar's." Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Give, therefore, unto Caesar the things of Caesar, and the things of Hashem, unto Hashem."

22. And having heard this, they were amazed and, having left Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they went away.  THE SHEILAH (QUESTION) ABOUT THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM

23. On that day some Tzedukim (Sadducees) approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "There is no Techiyas HaMesim."  And they interrogated Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,

24. saying, "Rabbi, Moshe Rabbenu  said that if someone dies, not having banim, his brother shall marry his isha (wife) to raise up zera (seed) for his brother.

25. Now there were among us shiva achim (seven brothers), and the first, having married, died.  And not having zera (offspring), left his isha to his brother.

26. Likewise, also the second brother and the third, up to the seventh.

27. And last of all, the isha died.

28. In the Techiyas HaMesim, therefore, she will be the woman of which of the seven? For all had her."

29. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, "You are in error, not having known the Kitvei HaKodesh or the gevurat Hashem."

30. For in the Techiyas HaMesim they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the malachim in Shomayim.

31. But concerning the Techiyas HaMesim, have you not read the thing spoken to you by Hashem, saying,

32. ANOCHI ELOHEI AVRAHAM ELOHEI YITZCHAK VEELOHEI YA'AKOV ("I am the G-d of Avraham, the G-d of Yitzchak, and the G-d of Ya'akov," [SHEMOT 3:6])?  Hashem is not the G-d of the Mesim (dead ones) but the G-d of the Chayyim (living)."

33. And having heard this, the multitudes were amazed at oshiach's torah (teaching). THE GREATEST MITZVAH

34. But the Perushim, having heard that he silenced the Tzedukim, assembled together,

35. and one of them, a Ba'al Torah (learned Torah scholar), tried to trip up Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with a sh'eilah (question):

36. "Rabbi, which mitzva is gedolah (great) in the Torah?"

37. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave this teshuva (answer) to the Ba'al Torah, "V'AHAVTAH ES ADONAI ELOHECHA B'CHOL LEVAVCHA UV'CHOL NAFSHECHA UV'CHOL M'ODECHA ("And thou shalt love the L-rd thy G-d with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might" [DEVARIM 6:5]).

38. This is the gedolah and rishonah mitzva.

39. And the second mitzva is like it: V'AHAVTAH L'REI'ACHA KAMOCHA"("And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," [VAYIKRA 19:18]).

40. On these two mitzvot hang the entire Torah and the Nevi'im.  MOSHIACH MAKES A DIYUK (INFERENCE) WHICH GIVES US THE TRUE DAAS TORAH INTERPRETATION OF TEHILLIM 110:1*

41. And, the Perushim, having been assembled, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach confronted with this sh'eilah (question),

42. saying, "What do you think concerning the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?  Whose Ben is he?"  The Perushim gave this teshuva (answer) to him, "Ben Dovid."

43. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "How then can Dovid, in the Ruach HaKodesh, call Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach `Adon`?... saying

44. NE'UM HASHEM LAADONI, SHEV LIMINI AD ASHIT OYVECHA HADOM LERAGLECHA ("Utterance of Hashem to my L-rd, `Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a foot stool for your feet`" TEHILLIM 110:1).

45. Therefore, if Dovid calls him `Adon,` how is Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [merely] Ben Dovid?"

46. And no one was able to give a teshuva (answer) to him, nor did anyone dare to pose another sh'eilah (question) to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from that day on.

## Matthew 23

1. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to the multitudes and to his talmidim,

2. saying, "Upon the Kisse Moshe (Chair of Moses) sit the Sofrim and the Perushim.

3. Therefore, everything whatever they may tell you, be frum and be shomer, but according to their ma'asim (works) do not be shomer, for they do not practice what they preach.

4. And they tie up heavy [extra-Biblical, Mt.4:4; 15:3,6-9; 22:29] loads, hard to bear, and they place them upon the shoulders of men, but they, with so much as a finger, are not willing to lift the oppressive burdens.  DO NOT SEEK AFTER CHASHIVUS OR A CHASHUVE POSITION IN THE KEHILLAH

5. And all their ma'asim hamitzvot (works of the commandments) they do in order to be seen by bnei Adam, for they their tefillin broad and lengthen their tzitziyot

6. and they love the places of honor at the seudot (banquet dinners), and the shuls,

7. and the `Shalom' greetings in the market places, and to be called by Bnei Adam, `Rebbe.'

8. But you are not to have pretentious titles like `Rebbe,' for One is your Rebbe [Moshiach], and all of you are achim.

9. And do not refer to anyone in Olam Hazeh as your `Abba,' for One is your Av sh'baShomayim.

10. Neither be called `Moreh Torah,' for One is your Moreh --the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

11. And the greatest among you will be your mesharet (servant/ minister).

12.  But whoever will lift up himself will be humbled, and whoever will humble himself will be lifted up.

13. But oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im (hypocrites), for in front of bnei Adam you shut the Malchut HaShomayim.  You do not go in yourselves, and the ones entering, you do not permit to enter.

14.  

15.  Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you travel over the sea and the dry land for the giyyur (proselytization) of one proselyte and then,  when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehinnom as you.

16. Oy to you, morei derech ivrim (blind guides), the, ones saying,`Whoever swears by the Beis Hamikdash, it is a worthless shevu'ah (oath): but whoever swears by the gold of the Beis Hamikdash, he is obligated.'

17. Iverim! (blind ones), for which is greater, the gold  or the Beis Hamikdash which gives the gold its kedusha (holiness, sanctity)?

18. `And whoever swears by the Mizbe'ach (altar), it is worthless; but whoever swears by the korban upon it, he is obligated.'

19. Ivrim, blind ones, for which is greater, the korban or the Mizbe'ach which gives the korban its kedusha (holiness, sanctity)?

20. Therefore, the one having sworn by the Mizbe'ach swears by it and everything upon it.

21. And the one having sworn by the Beis Hamikdash swears by it and by everything indwelling it.

22. And the one having sworn by Shomayim swears by the Kisei Hashem and by the One sitting upon it. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH SPEAKS ABOUT TERUMOS (OFFERINGS) AND MA'ASROS (TITHES)

23. Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you give ma'aser (tithe) of mint and dill and cumin, and you have neglected the matters of the Torah of greater consequence: mishpat, chesed, and emunah. These things it was necessary to do and those [others] not to neglect.

24. Morei derech ivrim (blind guides), the ones that strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH DEMANDS EHRLICHE YIDEN, WITH ALL HIS TALMIDIM GLAT KOSHER (FIT, PROPER) ON THE INSIDE AND WITH HIS HECHSHER THAT EACH IS A KOSHERER YID (GOOD AND RIGHTEOUS JEW)

25. Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im,  you cleanse the outside of the kos (cup) and the dish, but inside they are full of chamdanut (greed) and ta'avanut (lust).

26. Blind Parush, first cleanse the inside of the kos, that perhaps also the outside may become clean.

27. Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you are like kevarim (graves) having been whitewashed which on the outside indeed appear ois vaist (ostensibly) shein (beautiful), but on the inside are full of the unclean bones of the mesim (dead ones) and every kind of unclean treifoh.

28. Thus on the outside you indeed appear tzodek (righteous) to bnei Adam, but on the inside you are full of tzevi'ut (hypocrisy) and you are lawlessly against the Torah.

29. Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you build kevarim of the Nevi'im and decorate matsevot (gravestones) of the tzaddikim,

30. and you say, `If we were in the yamim (days) of Avoteinu (our Fathers), we would not have been chaverim (partners) with them in the dahm haNevi'im (blood of the Prophets).`

31. Therefore, you give edut (testimony) against yourselves that you are the banim (sons) of the ratzchaniyot (murderers) of the Nevi'im.

32. And you fill up the measure of your Avot.

33. Snakes, you yeladim of nachashim, how can you escape the Yom HaDin of Gehinnom?

34. For this reason--hinei!--I send to you Nevi'im and Chachamim and Sofrim, some of whom you will kill and some you will pierce al aitz (on the tree) and some you will subject to the shot (whip) in your shuls, and you will drive them out from city to city,

35. so that upon you may come all the dahm naki (innocent blood) shed upon the earth from the blood of Hevel to the blood of Zecharyah, *  whom you murdered between the Heikhal and the Mizbe'ach.

36.  Omein, I say to you, that all these things will come upon this generation. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES THE NEVU'AH (PROPHECY) OF THE CHURBAN (DESTRUCTION) OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH AND THE MAKKOS (PLAGUES) OF THE ACHARIT HAYAMIM--HIS KENA (LAMENT) OVER YERUSHALAYIM

37. Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, the ones that kill the Nevi'im and stone those having been sent to you!  How often have I wanted to gather your yeladim, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you were not willing!

38.  Hinei! Look!  KI LECHARBAHYIH' YEH HABEIT HAZEH (`for this House will become a ruin` (i.e. churban), YIRMEYAH 22:5).

39. For I say to you, by no means will you see me (Moshiach) from now until you say, BARUCH HABA B'SHEM ADONAI (`Blessed is the One who comes in the Name of Adonoi`).

## Matthew 24

1. And having exited from the Beis Hamikdash, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach departed, and his talmidim approached to show him the buildings of the Beis Hamikdash.

2. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, "Do you not see all these things? Omein, I say to you, by no means will be left here one stone upon another, for all will be demolished."

3. And while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, his talmidim approached him privately, saying, "Tell us when these things will be and what about the ot (sign) of the Bias Moshiach, of your Coming, and the kets haOlam Hazeh?"

4. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, "See to it that someone does not deceive you.

5. For many  will come in my Name, saying `I am  the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.`   And they will deceive many.

6.  But you are about to hear about milchamot (wars) and rumors of milchamot.  See to it that you are not alarmed, for it is necessary for this to happen, but it is not yet haKets (the End).

7. For there will be an intifada of ethnic group against ethnic group, and malchut against malchut.  And there will be famines and earthquakes in place after place.

8.  But all these things are but the beginning of the Chevlei [Moshiach].

9. Then they will hand you over to tzoros and they will kill you and you will be hated by all the ethnic groups on account of the Name of me (Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua).

10. And then many will be led into chet (sin), and others they will hand over and they will hate others.

11.  And many nevi'ei sheker (false prophets) will arise and will deceive many.

12. And because of the increased hefkerut (lawlessness, anarchy --Mt.7:23), the agape (love) of many will become cold.

13. But the one having endured to HaKets (the End), this one will receive Yeshu'at Eloheinu (the Salvation of our G-d).

14. And this Besuras HaGeulah of the Malchut will be announced in kol haOlam (all the world) as an edut (testimony) to all the Goyim, and then will come haKets (the End). REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON THE TZARAH GEDOLAH

15.  Therefore, when you see the Shikuts HaMeshomem (Abomination of Desolation), the thing spoken through Daniel HaNavi, having stood in the Makom Kadosh (Holy Place, i.e. the Beis Hamikdash) --let the reader understand!

16. Then the ones in Yehudah, let them flee to the mountains.

17. The one upon the roof, let him not come down to carry away the things from his bais (house).

18. And the one in the field, let him not turn back to get his kaftan.

19. But oy to the ones who are `with child` and the ones with nursing infants in those days.

20. But offer tefillos that your escape may not be in winter or on Shabbos.

21. For then will be Tzarah Gedolah (Great Tribulation*) such as has not been from Reshit HaOlam (Beginning of the World) until now nor will it by any means happen again.

22. And if those days were not cut short, kol basar (all flesh) would not be saved.  But, on account of the Kedoshim, the Bechirim (Chosen Ones), those days will be cut short.

23. Then, if someone says to you, `Hinei, here is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach!,` or, `Hinei! Here!` do not have emunah (faith) [in that].

24. For meshichei sheker (false moshiachs) will arise, and nevi'ei sheker (false prophets), and they will give otot gedolim (great signs) and moftim (wonders), so as to deceive, if possible, even the Bechirim (Chosen ones).

25. Hinei!  I have told  you beforehand!

26. If, therefore, they say to you, `Hinei! He (Moshiach) is in the desert!` do not go out [there].  `Hinei! [Moshiach] is in the secret cheder (room)!` do not have emunah (faith) [in that].

27. For as lightning goes out from the mizrach (east) and shines to as far as the ma'arav (west), thus will be the Bias HaMoshiach (coming of the Messiah, the Ben HaAdam, the Son of Man--DANIEL 7:13-14). *

28. Wherever the place of the Geviya (Corpse) is, there will be gathered together the nesharim (vultures, eagles [popularly]).



 THE BIAS HAMOSHIACH; THE GEULAH SHELEMAH (THE FINAL REDEMPTION) AS THE MOSHIACH'S MALACHIM COME FOR THE KIBUZ GALUYOT (THE INGATHERING OF THE EXILES)

29. Immediately after the Tzarah (Tribulation--Mt.24:21) of those days, the shemesh (sun) will be darkened, and the yare'ach (moon) will not give its light.  And the kochavim (stars) will fall from Shomayim, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

30. And then will appear the Ot Ben Adam (the Sign of the Son of Man) in Shomayim. All the tribes of kol ha'aretz (all the earth) will see the Ben HaAdam Moshiach and his Bias, his Coming, on the ananim of Shomayim (clouds of glory of Heaven) with gevurah (power) and great kavod (glory).

31. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will send his malachim with a loud blast of the Shofar, and the malachim will gather together Moshiach's Bechirim from the four winds, from one end of Shomayim to the other."  MOSHIACH'S HINT FOR MECHASHVEI KITSIN (RECKONERS OF THE END OF DAYS, ESCHATOLOGISTS)

32. "And from the aitz te'enah (fig tree), learn its parabolic lesson: when its branch has become tender already and sprouts leaves, you know that Kayits (Summer) is near;

33. thus also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the very doors.

34. Omein, I say to you, that this dor (generation) will by no means pass away until all these things come about.

35. Shomayim v'ha'Aretz (Heaven and Earth) will pass away, but my Dvar (Word) will by no means pass away.

36. But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, neither the malachim haShomayim nor HaBen, but only HaAv (the Father).

37. For as in the days of Noach, thus will be the Bias HaMoshiach, the Coming of the Ben HaAdam.

38. For as they were in those days before HaMabbul (the Flood), eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noach entered the Tevah (Ark).

39.  And they did not know until HaMabbul came and took away everything--thus also will be the Bias HaMoshiach, the Coming of the Ben HaAdam.

40. Then two men will be in the field, one is snatched away, and one is left behind (not retained).

41. Two women are grinding in the mill house, one is snatched away, one is left behind.

42. So be shomer, be on your guard, because you do not know on which day will be the Bias of Adoneichem (your L-rd).

43. But understand this: if the Ba'al Bayit had known in which watch the Ganav is coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have allowed his bais to be dug through.

44. For this reason also you be shomer,  for in the hour when you do not think, then will be the Bias HaMoshiach (the Coming of the Ben HaAdam).  THE FAITHFUL EVED VERSUS THE UNFAITHFUL EVED

45. Who then is the faithful and wise eved (servant), whom the Adon appointed over the household servants to give the other servants their food at the prescribed time?

46. Ashrey (happy) is that eved whom, when his Adon comes, finds him so doing.

47. Omein, I say to you, the Adon will ordain him to oversee all his possessions.

48. But if that wicked slave says in his heart, `Adoni (My Master) is dragging his feet,`

49.  and he begins to beat his fellow avadim (slaves), and he eats and drinks with the ones getting drunk,

50. the Adon of that slave will come on a day which he does not expect, and at an hour which he does not know.

51. And the Adon will cut in two that slave, and the slaves' portion he will put with the tzevu'im (hypocrites). There will be weeping and grinding of teeth."

## Matthew 25

1. Then the Malchut HaShomayim will be compared to eser almot (ten virgins), who, having taken their menorahs, went out to meet the Chosson (Bridegroom).

2. Now five of them were foolish and five were wise.

3. When the foolish took their menorahs, they neglected to take shemen (oil).

4. But the wise took shemen in containers with their menorahs.

5. Now the Chosson, being delayed, here's what happened:  all the almot became drowsy and were sleeping.

6. And at chatsot halailah (midnight) there was a shout, `Hinei! The Chosson (Bridegroom)! Go out to meet him!`

7. Then all the eser almot awakened and they trimmed their menorahs.

8.  But the foolish said to the wise, `Give us from your shemen (oil), for our menorahs are going out.`

9. But the wise answered, saying, `Perhaps there might not be enough for us and for you.  Instead, you go to the ones selling and buy for yourselves.`

10. And as they were going away to buy, the Bias of the Chosson (Bridegroom) occurred!  The ones prepared entered with him into the Chassuna (Wedding) feast and the door was shut.

11. And later, here comes also the other almot, saying, `Adoneinu, Adoneinu, open the door for us.`

12. But he, in reply, said, `Omein, I say to you, I do not know you.`

13. Be shomer, be on the alert, therefore, for you do not know the Yom or the Sha'ah (hour, time).  USING ONE'S TALENTS FOR REBBE,MELECH HAMOSHIACH: A MASHAL TEACHING THAT WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERY KISHROINOS (TALENT)

14. For it is as a man going on a journey, who called to his own avadim (slaves) and handed over to them his possessions.

15. And to this one, he gave five talents, and to this one, two, and to this one, one, each according to his own ability. Then the man went on his journey.  Immediately

16. after the man had gone, the one having received the five talents, went to work with them, and gained five others.

17. Likewise, the one having received the two talents--this one gained two others.

18. But the one, having received one, went out and dug a hole in the ground and buried the gelt (money) of his Adon in a hiding place.

19. And after much time, here comes the Adon of those servants.  And he conducts a settling of accounts with them.

20. Then the one who had received five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, `Adoni, five talents you gave me.  Hinei! Five more talents I gained.`

21. And his Adon said to him, `Shkoyach (well done), eved tov v'ne'eman! (good and faithful servant)! A few things you were faithful over, over many things I will ordain you.  Enter into the simcha of your Adon.

22. And having come forward, the one having received two talents, said, `You bestowed upon me two talents. Hinei! Two more talents I gained.`

23. His Adon said to him, `Shkoyach (well done), eved tov v'ne'eman!  A few things you were faithful over, over many things I will ordain you. Enter into the simcha of your Adon.`

24. And also the one who had received one talent stepped forward.   He said, `Adoni, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from that which you did not scatter seed.

25. And having been afraid and having gone away, I hid your talent by burying it in the ground.  Here, see, you have that which belongs to you.`

26. And, in reply, his Adon said to him, `You farbissener (mean) eved rah v'atzel (wicked and lazy slave), so you knew that I reap where I did not sow and I gather from which I did not scatter seed?

27. Then why was it not necessary for you to deposit my gelt with the bankers, and having returned, I would have received back that which was mine with interest?

28. Take, therefore, from him the talent and give it to the one having the ten talents.

29. For to everyone having, it will be given and he will have abundance, but from the one not having, even what he has will be taken from him.

30. And as for the useless slave, throw him into the outer choshech. There will be weeping and grinding of teeth.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE YOM HADIN OF THE NATIONS

31. And when the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (Ben HaAdam) comes, in his kavod and all his malachim  with him, then he will sit upon his Kissei Kavod (Glorious Throne).

32. And there will be assembled all the Goyim, and He will separate them from each other as the Ro'eh (the Shepherd) separates the Kevasim (Sheep) from the Izzim (Goats).

33. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will put the Kevasim on the right of him, but the Izzim on his left.

34. Then HaMelech HaMoshiach will say to the ones on his right, `Come! Baruchei Avi (Blessed of my Father), receive the bechorah (inheritance), the Malchut prepared for you from before Hivvased HaOlam (the establishing of the world).

35. For I hungered and you gave me something to eat.  I thirsted and you gave drink to me. I was a sojourner, and you extended hachnosat orchim (hospitality) to me.

36. I was naked and you gave me malbish arumim (clothing the naked).  I was ill and with bikkur cholim (visiting the sick) you ministered to me. I was in the beit hasohar (prison) and you came to me.`

37. Then the tzaddikim will answer Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, `Adoneinu, when did we see you hungering and we fed you, or thirsting and we gave you drink?

38. And when did we see you a sojourner and we extended hachnosat orchim (hospitality) to you, or naked and we clothed you?

39. And when did we see you ill or in the beit hasohar and we came to you?`

40. And, in reply, Rebbe HaMelech HaMoshiach will say to them, `Omein, I say to you, in as much as you did it to one of the least of these achim of mine, you did it to me.`

41. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will say also to the ones on his left, `Depart from me, the ones having been cursed, into the Aish Olam having been prepared for Hasatan and his malachim.

42. For I hungered and you did not give me something to eat, I thirsted and you did not give drink to me.

43. I was a sojourner and you did not extend hachnosat orchim to me, I was naked and you did not clothe me, ill and in the beit hasohar and you did not visit me.

44. Then also they will answer, saying, `Adoneinu, when did we see you hungering or thirsting or a sojourner or naked or sick or in the beit hasohar and we did not minister to you?

45. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will answer them, saying, `Omein, I say to you, in  as much as you did not do it for one of these least ones, neither for me did you do it.

46.  And these will go away into Onesh Olam (Eternal Punishment*), but the tzaddikim into Chayyei Olam (Eternal Life).`

## Matthew 26

1. And it came about when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach completed all these divrei torah, he said to his talmidim,

2. "You know, that after two days, there is Pesach, and the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (Ben HaAdam) is handed over to be pierced al Aitz (on the Tree)."

3. Then the Rashei Hakohanim and the Ziknei haAm (Elders of the People) were assembled in the courtyard of the residence of the Kohen Gadol (High Priest), the one being called Caiapha.

4. And they planned to arrest Yeshoshua by a trap and kill him.

5. But they were saying, "Not during the Chag (Feast), lest a riot break out among the am ha'aretz."

6. And, while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in Beit-Anyah in the bais of Shimon the leper,

7. an isha (woman) approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with an alabaster flask of costly mishcha (ointment), and she poured it out on Moshiach's rosh, as he sat bimesibba (reclining at tish [table]).

8.  And having seen this, Moshiach's talmidim were angry, saying, "For what is this waste?

9. For it would have been possible to sell this for a generous sum and give to the aniyim (poor ones)."

10. Aware of this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Why are you bringing about difficulty for the isha for the ma'aseh tov (good deed) she does to me."

11. For the aniyim you have with you always, but you do not always have me [Moshiach].

12. For this isha (woman) has poured this ointment on my guf (body) in order to prepare me for kevurah (burial).

13.  Omein, I say to you, wherever this Besuras HaGeulah is preached b'chol HaOlam (in all the world), in her zechirah (remembrance) it will be spoken also what was done by her."

14. Then, one of the Shneym Asar (Twelve), Yehudah from K'riot, went to the Rashei Hakohanim

15. and said, `What are you willing to give me? And I will hand him over to you.'  And they weighed out for him sheloshim shiklei kesef (thirty pieces of silver).

16.  And from then on he was seeking an opportunity that he might hand Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach over.

17. But on the first day of Chag HaMatzot, Moshiach's talmidim approached him, saying, "Where do you wish we should prepare for you your Seder?"

18. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Go into the city to such-and-such person and say to him, `Our Rebbe says, my time is at hand.  With you I am observing Pesach with my talmidim.`"

19. And the talmidim did as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach commanded them, and they prepared the Seder.  MOSHIACH'S FINAL HAMOTZI AND BERAKHAH OVER THE CUP OF BERACHA (BLESSING) AT MOSHIACH'S SEDER

20.  When erev came, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting bimesibba (reclining) at tish with the Shneym Asar Talmidim.

21. And as they were eating with their Rebbe, he said, "Omein, I say to you that one of you will be my betrayer."  THE TIME OF CHESHBON HANEFESH OF THE SHLUCHIM AND THE BEDIKAS CHOMETZ OF DENIAL AND BETRAYAL

22. And much distressed, each one began to say to him, "Surely I am not the one, Adoni?"

23. But, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "The one having dipped the hand into the bowl [SHEMOT 12:8] with me, this one is my betrayer."

24. "Indeed the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (Ben HaAdam) goes as it was written concerning him, but oy to that man through whom the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (Ben HaAdam) is betrayed.  It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."

25.  And, in reply, Yehudah the betrayer of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said, "Surely I am not the one, Rebbi?"  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Yehudah, "You have said it."

26. And at the Seudah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having taken matzah, having made the ha-Motzi, he offered the betzi'at halechem (breaking of the bread), giving it to the talmidim, and said, "Take and eat, this is my    basar." * 

 THE FINAL KIDDUSH IN ZIKARON (REMEMBRANCE) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH WHOSE TZAVA'AH (LAST WILL) IS THE BRIT CHADASHA KAPPARAH FOR OUR SELICHA (FORGIVENESS) AND DEVEKUS (COMMUNION WITH G-D)

27. And having taken the Kiddush Cup (Kos) and having made the beracha, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.

28. For this is my [Moshiach's] Dahm HaBrit HaChadasha, which is being shed LARABBIM (`for Many` YESHAYAH 53:11-12) for the selicha (forgiveness) of chatta'im (sins).

29. And I say to you, I will by no means drink from now on of this p'ri hagefen (fruit of the vine) until that Day when I drink it with you chadash (new) in the Malchut Avi (Kingdom of my Father)." MOSHIACH'S L'HITRAOT AND THE FINAL MIZMOR (HYMN), THE LAST TISH NIGGUN OF OUR REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH

30. And having sung the Hallel, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

31. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "All of you will be offended at me [Moshiach] during this night, for it has been written, HACH ES HARO'EH UTEFUTSEN HATSON ("Strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered" ZECHARYAH 13:7).

32. But after I undergo Techiyas HaMesim I will go ahead of you to the Galil." [Mt.28:7]

33. And, in reply, Kefa said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "If everyone will be offended at you, I never will be offended."

34. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Omein, I say to you that balailah hazeh (during this night), before a tarnegol (cock) crows, you will make hakhchashah (denial) of me [as Moshiach] shalosh pa'amim (three times)."

35. Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, by no means will I deny you. "Likewise all the talmidim spoke also.   THE FINAL TEMPTATION OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH; THE ADAM HECHADASH IN THE GAN HANISYONOS (GARDEN OF TEMPTATION) GAINS THE  ESCHATOLOGICAL MESSIANIC NITZACHON (VICTORY)

36. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes with them to a place being called Gat-Sh'manim, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the talmidim, "Sit here until I go over there and daven."

37. And having taken Kefa and the two sons of Zavdai, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to be sorrowful and distressed with agmat nefesh (grief).

38. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "My nefesh is deadly grieved, even to the point of mavet (death).  Remain here and stay awake with me."

39. And having gone forward a short distance, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach fell upon his face, davening and saying, "Avi, if it is possible, let this Kos * pass from me. But not as I will but as you will (Mt.6:10; 12:50)." MISHMAROT (WATCHMEN) FALL ASLEEP

40. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes to the talmidim and finds them sleeping, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Kefa, "So were you not strong enough to be awake for one hour with me?

41. Stay awake and offer tefillos, lest you enter lidey nisayon (Mt.6:13).  Indeed the ruach is willing but the basar is weak."

42. Again, for a second time, having left, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach davened, saying, "Avi, if it is not possible for this to pass by except I drink it, let ye'aseh  r'tzonechah." [Mt.6:10]

43. And having come again, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach found the talmidim sleeping, for their eyes were too heavy to stay open.

44.  And having left them again and having gone away, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was davening for the shlishit (third) time, saying the same words.

45. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes to the talmidim and says to them, "Sleep on now and take your rest.  Hinei!  The hour is at hand, and the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (Ben HaAdam) is being betrayed into the hands of chote'im (sinners).

46. Arise, and let us go. Hinei!  My betrayer has drawn near."

47. And while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was still speaking-- hinei!-- Yehudah, one of the Shneym Asar, came and with him came a great multitude with swords and clubs from the Rashei Hakohanim (Chief Priests) and the Ziknei haAm (the Elders of the People).

48. Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I may give the neshikah (kiss), he is the one. Chap (grab) him!"

49.  And immediately, he approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and said, "Shalom, Rebbe."  And he gave him the neshikah.

50. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Chaver, do what you came for." Then, having approached, they laid hands on Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and arrested him.

51. And--hinei!--one of the ones with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach stretched out his hand, drew his cherev (sword), and struck the servant of the Kohen Gadol, cutting off his ear.

52. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "Return your sword into its place; for all who take the sword will die by the sword.

53. Or do you think that I am not able to call upon Avi, and He will provide me now more than Shneym Asar legions of malachim?

54. But how then may the Kitvei Hakodesh be fulfilled that say it must happen thus?"

55. At that moment, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to the multitudes, "Do you have the chutzpah (nerve) to come out, as against a revolutionary, with swords and clubs to arrest me? Daily in the Beis Hamikdash I was sitting giving my torah (teaching) and you did not arrest me.

56. But this all happened that the Kitvei Hakodesh of the Nevi'im might be fulfilled."  Then the talmidim deserted Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and fled. 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN, THE BEGINNING OF HIS TZA'AR (PAIN AND SUFFERING)

57.  But the ones having arrested Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach led him away to Caiapha the Kohen Gadol, where the Sofrim and the Zekenim (Elders) were gathered together.

58. And Kefa was following Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from far away. He followed him as far as the courtyard of the Kohen Gadol and, having gone inside it, Kefa was sitting down with the servants to see the outcome.

59. And the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sanhedrin all were seeking edut sheker (false testimony of false witnesses) against Yehoshua so that they might put him to death.

60. And they found none, though many with edut sheker came forward. At last, two came forward

61. and said, "This one said, `I am able to bring about a churban (destruction) of the Beis Hamikdash of Hashem and within shloshah yamim to build it.`

62. And having got up, the Kohen Gadol said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Do you answer nothing? For what do these men give edut (testimony) against you?"

63. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was silent.  And the Kohen Gadol said to him, "I adjure you by Hashem, Elohim Chayyim, to tell us if you are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Ben HaElohim."

64. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "You said it.  But I say to you, `From now on you will see the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach) sitting at the right hand of Gevurah (Power) and his Bias (Coming) will be with ANENEI HASHOMAYIM ("clouds of Heaven," DANIEL7:13-14).`"

65. Then the Kohen Gadol made the keriah (rending of his garments), saying, "He has committed Chillul Hashem. What further need do we have of edut?  Hinei!  Now you have heard the Chillul Hashem.

66. What does it seem to you?"  And, in reply, they said, "He is deserving of the death penalty."

67. Then they spat into his face and they struck him and they slapped him,

68. saying, "Give us nevu'ah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  Who is the one who hit you?"

 KEFA MAKES HAKHCHASHAH (DENIAL) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

69.  Now Kefa was sitting outside in the courtyard. And one maid approached Kefa, saying, "And you were with Yehoshua of the Galil!"

70. But Kefa denied it before everyone, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."

71. And having gone out to the gate, another saw Kefa and says to the bystanders, "There!  This one was with Yehoshua of Natzeret!"

72. And again Kefa denied it with a shevu'ah (oath), "I do not know the man!"

73. And after a little while the bystanders came and said to Kefa, "Truly also you are one of them, for even your accent gives you away!"

74. Then Kefa began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a tarnegol (cock) crowed.

75. And Kefa remembered the word which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had said: "Before a tarnegol (cock) crows you will deny me shalosh pa'amim (three times)."  And Kefa went out and wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. Now when boker had come, all the Rashei Hakohenim and the Ziknei haAm took counsel together against Yehoshua to put him to death.  HASHEM'S AKEDAH OF THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, WHO IS HIMSELF THE YITZCHAK OF YISROEL'S REDEMPTION; MATTITYAHU WAS MECHAVEN (MAKING AN ALLUSION) TO THE AKEDAH

2. And having performed the akedah (binding), they led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the Governor.

3. Then when Yehudah, who had betrayed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saw that Yehoshua had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the sheloshim shiklei kesef (thirty pieces of silver) to the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim,

4. saying "Chatati (`I have sinned`).  I have betrayed dam naki (innocent blood)."  But they said, "What is that to us?  See to that yourself!"

5. And Yehudah threw the shiklei kesef (pieces of silver) into the Beis Hamikdash and departed; and, having gone away, Yehudah hanged himself.

6. And the Rashei Hakohanim took the shiklei kesef and said, "It is asur (forbidden) to put these into the Beis Hamikdash otzar (treasury), vi-bahlt (since) it is blood money."

7. And they took counsel together and they bought the potter's field as a beit kevarot (cemetery) for zarim (foreigners).

8. For this reason that field has been called the `Sadeh HaDahm (Field of Blood)` to this day.

9. Then that which was spoken through Yirmeyah HaNavi was fulfilled, saying, "And they took the SHELOSHIM KASEF (thirty pieces of silver), HAYEKAR (the price) of the one whose price had been set by the Bnei Yisroel.

10. And they gave them for the potter's field as Hashem directed (ZECHARYAH 11:12-13)."

11. Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach stood before the Governor, and the Governor questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Are you the Melech HaYehudim?"  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "It is as you say."

12.  And while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was being accused by the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered nothing.

13. Then Pilate said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Do you not hear how many things they give edut against you?"

14. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not answer him with even one word, so that the Governor was quite amazed. THOUGH IT IS PESACH AND NOT YOM KIPPUR, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FULFILLS A YOM KIPPUR MOTIF IN THE QUESTION OF KAPPARAH IN TWO "SONS OF THE FATHER," ONE FOR HASHEM, ONE FOR AZAZEL (VAYIKRA 16:6-9]; MOSHIACH MA SHE-EIN KEIN BAR-ABBA

15. Now at the Chag (Festival) the Governor was accustomed to release for the multitude any one prisoner whom they wanted.

16. And they were holding at the time a notorious prisoner, called [Yeshua] Bar-Abba ["son of the father"].

17. When therefore they were gathered together Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Bar-Abba or Yehoshua who is called Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?"

18. For Pilate knew that because of kin'ah (envy) they had delivered Yehoshua up.

19. And while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that Tzaddik; for last night I suffered greatly in a cholom (dream) because of Yehoshua."

20.  However, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim persuaded the multitudes to ask for Bar-Abba, but Yehoshua they should destroy.

21. But the Governor answered, saying to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" and they said, "Bar-Abba."

22. In reply, Pilate says to them,  "What, therefore, may I do with Yehoshua, the one called the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?" Everyone says, "Let him be hanged on HaAitz (the Tree, Devarim 21:22)! Let him be hanged on HaAitz!"

23. But Pilate said, "Why? What ra'ah (evil) has he done?"  But they kept shouting all the more, saying, "Let him be hanged on HaAitz!"

24.  And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to that yourselves."

25. And, in reply, all the people said, "His dahm be on us and on our yeladim." *

26. Then Pilate released Bar-Abba to them.  But after having Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach scourged, he handed him over to be hanged on HaAitz.  MOSHIACH'S KETER OF THORNS

27. Then the soldiers of the Governor took Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach into the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

28. And they stripped him and put a royal scarlet robe on him, and,

29. after weaving a keter of thorns, they placed it on his head and put a reed in his right hand, and they fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and mocked him saying, "Hail, Melech HaYehudim!"

30. And they spat on Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and took the reed and began to beat him on the head.

31. And after they had ridiculed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they took his robe off and put his garments on him, and led him away to hang him on HaAitz.

32.  And as they were coming out, they found a man from Cyrene named Shimon, whom they pressed into service to bear Moshiach's Aitz (Tree).

33. And when they had come to a place called Gulgolta, which means "place of a skull,"

34. they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And, after tasting it, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was unwilling to drink.        THE HAGBA (LIFTING UP) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

35. When they had hanged Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach on HaAitz,  they divided up Moshiach's garments among themselves, casting lots;

36. and, sitting down, they began to keep watch over him there.

37. They put up above his head the charge against him which read, THIS IS YEHOSHUA, MELECH HAYEHUDIM.

38. At that time, two shodedim (robbers) were each hanged on his own aitz with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, one on the right and one on the left.

39. And those passing by were hurling Chillul Hashem at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, wagging their heads,

40. and saying, "You who are going to cause the churban (destruction) of the Beis Hamikdash and rebuild it in shloshah yamim (three days), save yourself!  If you are the Ben HaElohim, come down from HaAitz (the Tree)."

41. Likewise, also the Rashei Hakohanim along with the Sofrim and Zekenim, were mocking him, and saying,

42. "He saved others;  yet himself he is not able to save. He is Melech Yisroel?  Let him now come down from the Aitz, and we shall have emunah in him.

43. "He trusts in Hashem; let Hashem be his Moshi'a and deliver him now, if Hashem takes pleasure in him, for this one said, `Ben HaElohim Ani!`"

44. And the shodedim (robbers), hanging, each on his aitz, with him, were casting similar insults at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, reproaching him.

45. Now, from the sixth hour, choshech fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.

46. And about the ninth hour, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out with a kol gadol, saying "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani! * (that is, "My G-d, my G-d, why hast thou forsaken me? "TEHILLIM 22:2[1]).

47. And some of those who were standing there, when they heard, began saying, "This one calls for Eliyahu."

48. And immediately one of them ran and, taking a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink.

49. But the rest of them said, "Wait.  We will see whether Eliyahu will come to save him."

50. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his ruach.

51. And--hinei!--the parochet (curtain) of the Beis Hamikdash was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook; and the rocks were split

52. and the kevarim (graves) were opened, and many gufot (bodies) of the kedoshim who had fallen asleep were made to stand up alive.

53. And coming out of the kevarim after Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim, they entered the Ir HaKodesh (Holy City) and appeared to many.

54. Now when the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, they became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Ben HaElohim."

55. And many nashim were there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from the Galil and had ministered to him.

56. Among them was Miryam of Magdala, Miryam the Em of Ya'akov and Yosef, and the Em of Zavdai's sons.  THE MOSHIACH'S OWN CHEVRAH KADDISHA FORMS TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE KEVURAH OF THE NIFTAR

57. And when it was erev, there came a rich man from Ramatayim named Yosef who himself had also become a talmid of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

58. This man went to Pilate and asked for the guf Yehoshua [TEHILLIM 16:9-10]. Then Pilate ordered it to be given over to Yosef.

59. And Yosef took the guf Yehoshua, and wrapped it in a tachrichim,

60. and laid it in his own new kever, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the kever (tomb) and went away.

61. And Miryam of Magdala, and the other Miryam, stayed there, sitting opposite the kever.

62. Now on the next day [trans. note: i.e. Shabbos], which is the one after the Preparation,* the Rashei Hakohanim and the Perushim gathered together with Pilate

63. and said, "Sir, we remember that when he was still alive that mat'eh (deceiver) said, `After shloshah yamim I am to rise again.`

64. Therefore, give orders for the kever to be made secure until the Yom HaShlishi (the Third Day), lest his talmidim come and steal him away and say to the people, `He has stood up alive from the dead.`  And the last deception will be worse than the first."

65. Pilate said to them, "You have a guard, go make the kever as secure as you know how."

66. And they went and made the kever secure, and, along with the guard, they set a seal on the (stone).

## Matthew 28

1. Now after Shabbos, at the time of Shacharit on Yom Rishon (the first day of the week), Miryam of Magdala and the other Miryam came to look at the kever.

2. And--hinei!--a great earthquake had occurred, for a malach Adonoi (an angel of Hashem) descended from Shomayim and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.

3. And his appearance was like lightning and his garment as white as snow.

4. And the shomrim shook for fear of him and became like dead men.

5. And the malach, in reply, said to the nashim,  "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Yehoshua, who has been hanged on HaAitz. *

6. "He is not here. For to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has come the Techiyas HaMesim, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.

7. "And go quickly, tell his talmidim about Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim.  And--hinei!--he is going ahead of you into the Galil.  There you will see him.  Hinei! I have told you!"

8. And they departed quickly from the kever with fear and great simcha and ran to report everything to Moshiach's talmidim.

9. And--hinei!--Moshiach met them, saying" Shalom Alechem."  And they came up and took hold of his feet and fell prostrate before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

10. Then he said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and take word to my achim that they may go away to the Galil, and there they shall see me."

11. Now while they were on their way--hinei!--some of the shomrim came into the city and reported to the Rashei Hakohanim all the things that had happened.

12. And when they had assembled with the Zekenim and counseled together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,

13. and said, "You are to say, `His talmidim came by night and stole him away while we were asleep,`

14. "And if this should come to the Governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble."

15. And the ones who took the kesef did as they had been instructed, and this story was widely spread among the Yehudim to this day.

16. But the Achad Asar Talmidim proceeded to the Galil, to the mountain which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had designated.

17. And when they saw him, they prostrated themselves before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, but some were doubtful. MOSHIACH'S PROGRAM OF KIRUV RECHOKIM (BRINGING NEAR THE FAR AWAY ONES)

18. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came up and spoke to them, saying,  "All samchut (authority) has been given to me in Shomayim and on haAretz.  MOSHIACH'S GZERAH MIN HASHOMAYIM

19.  Go, therefore, make talmidim for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach of all the  nations, giving them a tevilah in a mikveh mayim in Hashem, the Name of HaAv, HaBen, and HaRuach haKodesh,

20. teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And --hinei!--I [Moshiach] am with you always, even unto the Ketz HaOlam Hazeh."
