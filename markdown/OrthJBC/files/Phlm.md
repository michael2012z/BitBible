# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1. Sha'ul, a prisoner of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua and Timotiyos acheinu [(our) brother].   To Philemon ha'ahuv (the beloved) and our fellow po'el (worker)

2. and to Apphia achoteinu (our sister) and to Archippus our chaver leneshek (comrade-in-arms) and to the kehillah in your house.

3. Chesed Hashem and shalom Hashem to you from Elohim Avinu and from Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua. THE AHAVAH AND EMUNAH OF PHILEMON

4. I always offer a berucha to my G-d when I mention you in my tefillos (prayers),

5. because I hear of your ahavah (agapâ€š) and emunah, which you have for Yehoshua Adoneinu and for all the kedoshim.

6. (I pray) that your emunah (emunah) being shared in Moshiach's kiruv rechokim (bringing near the far away ones) may become effective in a knowledge of every mitzva we may do for Moshiach.

7. For I had simcha gedolah (much joy) and chizuk (encouragement) because of your ahavah, for the hearts of the kedoshim have been refreshed through you, ach b'Moshiach.           AN APPEAL FOR ONESIMUS; RAV SHA'UL PREFERS NOT TO MECHAYEV (COMPEL) HIM TO DO WHAT IS HIS CHOVAH MUSARIT

8. Therefore, though I have much boldness in Moshiach that I could in fact order you to do your chovah musarit (moral duty) of avodas hakodesh (holy service),

9. yet I would rather make an appeal on the mekor (basis) of ahavah (agape)--I, Sha'ul, the Zaken (Elder) but also a prisoner of Moshiach Yehoshua.
 ON BEING A "USEFUL" KELI KODESH (MINISTER)

10. I appeal to you concerning beni, having "fathered" him (to a new birth) while in bais hasohar (prison)--that is, Onesimus (trans. note: means "Useful")

11. --the one once "Useless" to you, but, now, both to you and to me--"Useful."

12.  I am sending him who is my very lev (heart) back to you.

13. I was wanting to detain him with me, in order that he might function as a keli kodesh (minister), ministering to me in your place, as your murshe (proxy), while I'm detained in the imprisonment of the Besuras HaGeulah.

14. But I wanted to do nothing without your haskamah (consent), in order that the mitzva you do might not be meshabed (caused to be obligated) or forced but voluntary.

15. Eppes (perhaps) he was separated from you for a while in order that you might have him back for Yamim haOlam,

16. no longer as a bond-servant, but, more than a bond-servant, an ach ahuv (a beloved brother), especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in Adoneinu.

17. So if you consider me a chaver (partner), receive him as you would me.

18. But if in anything he wronged you or owes you, charge this to my account.

19. I, Sha'ul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay.  This is not to merken (draw attention) to the fact that you owe me your very neshamah.

20. Yes, ach baMoshiach, I would have some "usefulness" from you in Adoneinu. Refresh my lev in Moshiach.

21. Confident of you as one who is shomer mitzvot, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even above what I say.

22. Also, this too, prepare a heimishe mekom linah (guest room, lodging place) for me, for I have the tikvah (hope) that through your tefillos I will be restored to you.  SHALOM GREETINGS FROM SOME OF THE INSPIRED AUTHORS OF THE ORTHODOX JEWISH BRIT CHADASHA AND ALSO GREETINGS FROM OTHER KLEI KODESH (MINISTERS)

23. Epaphras, my co-prisoner in Moshiach Yehoshua, sends "Shalom" greetings to you.

24. And Markos, Aristarchus, Demas, and Lukas, my fellow po'alim (workers), do as well.

25. The Chesed Hashem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua be with your neshamah.
