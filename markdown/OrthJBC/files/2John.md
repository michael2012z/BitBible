## 2 John 1

1. From the Zeken (Elder, SHEMOT 3:16) To the Gevirah haBechirah (the Chosen Lady) and her Banim (Sons, Children), for whom I have ahavah (agap‚) b'Emes, and not only I but also all those who have da'as haEmes (knowledge of the Truth),

2.  because of haEmes that dwells inside us, and will be immanu (with us) for Yamim haOlam.

3. Chen v'Chesed Hashem (unmerited favor and kindness), Rachamim Hashem (mercy), and Shalom Hashem (peace) will be immanu (with us) from Elohim HaAv and from haMelech haMoshiach Yehoshua, haBen of HaAv, in Emes and Ahavah (agap‚).                             EMES AND AHAVAH

4. I had simcha gedola (much joy) that I have found some of your Banim with a walk which is Halicha b'Derech Emes (Conduct in the Way of Truth), just as we received a mitzva (commandment) to do so from HaAv [1:3].

5. And now I beseech you, Gevirah [1:1], not as a mitzva chadasha (new commandment) I am writing you, but that which we had from meyReishit (from the Beginning): that we should have ahavah (agap‚) one for the other [Yochanan 13:34].

6. And this is ahavah, that we should walk with a Halicha according to the Mitzvot of Moshiach;  this is the mitzva just as you have heard it meyReishit --you must walk in it [1:5].

7. Because mat`im rabbim (many misleaders/deceivers) have gone out into the world, the ones not making the Ani Ma'amin (confession) that Rebbe,  Melech haMoshiach Yehoshua habah b'basar (has come in bodily flesh); this one is haMat`eh (the Deceiver) and the Anti-Moshiach.

8. Watch out for yourselves, lest you lose what we worked for, but may receive a sachar maleh (full reward).

9.  Everyone who runs ahead and does not remain in the Torah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach does not have Hashem; the one remaining in the Torah [of Moshiach], this one has both HaAv and haBen.

10. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this Torah, do not receive him into your house [kehillah], and do not greet him with "Shalom."

11. For the one exchanging "Shalom" greetings with him participates with (i.e. has koinonia with), has shuttafut (partnership) with, his ma'asim hara'im (evil deeds).

12. I have many things to write to you; I wanted not to do so with parchment and ink, but I have the tikvah (hope) to be with you and to speak panim el panim (directly, in person--Devarim 34:10), that our simcha (joy) may be shleimah (complete).

13. The Banim of your Achot haBechirah (Chosen Sister) send you "Shalom" greetings.
