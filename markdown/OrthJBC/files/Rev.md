# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. The Gilluy Shechinah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua which Hashem gave to him to show to his mesharetim (servants, klei kodesh, ministers) MAH DI LEHEVE ("what will happen," Daniel 2:28f), the things which are destined to take place, and speedily; Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach made it known by sending his malach (angel) to his mesharet (servant, keli kodesh, minister), Yochanan. [Amos 3:7]

2. Yochanan gave solemn edut (testimony) to the Dvar Hashem and to the edut of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, even to all that Yochanan saw.

3. Ashrey (Blessed/Happy) is the one reading and the ones hearing the divrei hanevu'ah (words of [this] prophecy) and remaining shomer regarding what is written in it, for kerovah (near) is the et [the time of crisis and the events related to the Bias HaMoshiach].

4. Yochanan to the sheva (seven) hakehillot (congregations) in Asia: Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and Shalom from the One who is [Shemot 3:14], who was, and who is to come [Yeshayah 41:4], and from the shevat haruchot (seven spirits, Yeshayah 11:2) which are before Hashem's kisseh [merkavah chariot throne in Shomayim, Yechezkel 1:4-28].

5. And from Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the eidus hane'eman (faithful witness), the Bechor (Firstborn, Tehillim 89:28 [27]) of the Mesim and the Nagid, Elyon L'Malkhey A'retz ("Leader, Most exalted of Kings of the earth, Tehillim 89:27).  To the One who has ahavah for us and has made the full pedut (redemption for the Geulah) to free us from avoneinu (our gross wickednesses) by the dahm [blood kapparah] of him, [Tehillim 130:8; Yeshayah 40:2; Tehillim 89:38; Yirmeyah 42:5; Yeshayah 55:4; Bereshis 22:8; Shemot 12:13; Yeshayah 53:7]

6. and made us a Malchut, a Mamlekhet kohanim [Shemot 19:6], kohanim doing avodas kodesh to his Elohim HaAv, lo hakavod v'hagevurah l'olmey olamim. Omein. [Shemot 19:6; 23:22; Yeshayah 61:6]

7. Hinei! Hu habah (He comes) with HA'ANANIM (glory clouds) and kol ayin (every eye) will see him, even the ones who PIERCED HIM, and all the mishpachot (families) of ha'aretz will MOURN for Him. Ken, Omein. [Daniel 7:13; Zecharyah 12:10f; Bereshis 12:3;28:14]

8. "Ani Hu the Alef and the Tav," says Hashem Adonoi, the One who is and the One who was and the One coming, Adonoi Tzvaot. [Shemot 3:14; Yeshayah 41:4; Amos 3:13; 4:13 Targum Ha-Shivim (Septuagint)]  A CHAZON (CHABAKUK 2:2) OF THE MOSHIACH AND THE RAZ OF THE MENOROT AND THE KOKHAVIM

9. I, Yochanan, your Ach b'Moshiach and your fellow partaker of the khelek (inheritance) and the tzarah (Mt.24:15f), the Chevlai Moshiach, and the Malchut and the savlanut (patient endurance) in Moshiach, was on the island called Patmos because of the dvar Hashem and the solemn edut of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. [Shemot 20:18; Daniel 8:1]

10. I was in the Ruach Hakodesh on Yom HaAdon and I heard behind me a great sound, like the blast of a shofar, [Yechezkel 3:12; Shemot 19:16]

11. saying, "What you see [in the chazon], write in a sefer and send it to the sheva Kehillot, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. [Yeshayah 30:8]

12. Then I turned to see the kol which was speaking with me, and, having turned, I saw sheva golden menorot. [Zecharyah 4:2; Shemot 25:31-40]

13. And in the midst of the menorot stood One like the Ben HaAdam [Daniel 7:13-14; Yechezkel 1:26], having been clothed in a kaftan (long coat) reaching to the feet and having been wrapped around at the chest with a golden gartel. [Daniel 7:13; Yechezkel 1:26; 9:2,11 Targum Ha-Shivim (Septuagint); Daniel 10:5,16; Yeshayah 6:1]

14. And the rosh of him and the hair were lavan (white) like wool, like snow, and the eynayim (eyes) of him were like a flame of aish (fire), [Daniel 7:9]

15. and the feet of him were like burnished bronze as if in a furnace having been made to glow, and the kol of him as the sound of mayim rabbim (many waters). [Daniel 10:6; Yechezkel 1:7,24; 43:2; Yeshayah 1:20; 49:2; Shofetim 5:31]

16. And he had in the yad yamin of him shevat hakokhavim (seven stars) and out of the mouth of him a sharp two-edged cherev going forth and the face of him was like the shemesh (sun) shining in its power. [Yeshayah 1:20; 49:2; Shofetim 5:31]

17. And when I saw him, I fell at the feet of him as though dead, and he placed the yad yamin of him upon me saying, "Do not fear; I am HaRishon (The First) and HaAcharon (The Last) [Yeshayah 41:4; 44:6; 48:12; Yechezkel 1:28; Daniel 8:17,18;]

18. and HaChai (The Living One), and I became Niftar and,-- hinei!-- Chai Ani l'Olam va'ed and I have the maftekhot haMavet (keys of Death) and the maftekhot haShe'ol.[Yeshayah 41:4; 44:2,6; 48:12; Yechezkel 1:28; Daniel 4:34; 12:7; 8:17-18; Devarim 32:40; Iyov 38:17]

19. Write down the Chazon (Revelation, Prophecy, Vision, Chabakuk 2:2), therefore, that is, the things you saw and the things which are and the things which are about to happen after these things.[Yeshayah 48:6 Targum Ha-Shivim (Septuagint); Daniel 2:28,29,45;]

20. The raz (mystery, sod) of the shevat hakokhavim (seven stars) which you saw in the yad yamin of me and the sheva golden menorot: the shevat hakokhavim are the malachim of the Kehillot (Congregations) and the sheva menorot are the sheva Kehillot.

## Revelation 2

1. To the malach of the Kehillah (Congregation) in Ephesus, write: These things says the One holding shevat hakokhavim (seven stars) in the yad yamin of him, the One walking in the midst of the sheva golden menorot:

2. "I have da'as of your ma'asim and your amal (toil) and the savlanut (patient endurance) of you (pl.) and that you cannot bear anshei resha, and have tested the ones calling themselves "Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's shluchim" and are not, and found them shakranim (liars).

3. And you have savlanut (patient endurance), and you have persevered because of ha-Shem of me and have not become weary.

4. But I have this against you, that you abandoned your Ahavah HaRishonah. [Yirmeyah 2:2]

5. Therefore, let there be zikaron (remembrance) of from where you have fallen and make teshuva (repentance, turning from sin to G-d) and do the Ma'asim HaRishonim;  but, if not, I am coming to you (pl.) and I will remove your menorah, from its place, unless you make teshuva.

6. But this you have, that you loathe the ma'asim ra'im of the Nicolaitans, which also I loathe.[Tehillim 139:21]

7. The one having an ear let him hear what the Ruach Hakodesh says to the Kehillot. To the one who wins the nitzachon (victory) I will give to him to eat of the Aitz HaChayyim, which is in the Gan-Eden of Hashem, [Bereshis 2:9; 3:22,24; also Bereshis 2:8; Yechezkel 28:1; 31:8,9 Targum Ha-Shivim (Septuagint)]
 THE IGGERET HAKODESH TO THE KEHILLAH AT SMYRNA

8. And to the malach of the Kehillah in Smyrna, write: these things says HaRishon and HaAcharon, who became niftar and came back to Chayyim (Life): [Yeshayah 44:6; 48:12]

9. I have da'as of your tzarah (Mt.24:15f) and oni poverty)--but you are ashir (rich)--and the loshon hora of the ones declaring themselves to be Bnei Berit, and are not, but are a Shul [deluded by] Hasatan.

10. Do not fear at all the things you are about to suffer. Hinei! Hasatan is about to cast some of you into beit hasohar that you may be tested and you will have tzarah aseret yamim. Be ne'eman ad haMavet (faithful unto death), and I will give you the ateret HaChayyim (the diadem of Life). [Daniel 1:12,14]

11. The one having ears let him hear what the Ruach Hakodesh says to the Kehillot. The one who wins the nitzachon (victory) never will be hurt by the Mavet HaSheyni.   THE IGGERET HAKODESH TO THE KEHILLAH AT PERGAMUM

12. And to the malach of the Kehillah at Pergamum, write: these things says the one having the sharp two-edged cherev: [Yeshayah 49:2]

13. "I have da'as of where you make your ma'on, where the kisseh of Hasatan is, and you hold fast ha-Shem of me and did not make hakhchashah (denial) of the emunah in me, even in the days of Antipas eidus hane'eman (my faithful witness) who died al kiddush Ha-Shem, killed among you as a martyr where Hasatan makes his ma'on.

14. But I have a few things against you, because you have there ones holding to "the torah of Bil`am," who was teaching Balak to put a michshol before Bnei Yisroel. [Bamidbar 31:16; 25:1-2]

15. So also you have ones eating okhel (food) sacrificed to elilim and who commit zenut. You also have ones holding the "torah of the Nicolaitans."

16. Likewise, therefore, make teshuva (repentance, turning from sin to G-d)!  But if not, I am coming to you quickly and will war against them by the cherev of the mouth of me [Yeshayah 49:2]

17. The one having an ear let him hear what the Ruach Hakodesh says to the Kehillot. To the one who wins the nitzachon (victory), I will give him some of the Manna having been hidden, and I will give Him an Even Levanah (White Stone) and upon it a Shem Chadash, of which no one has da'as, except the one receiving it. [Tehillim 78:24; Yeshayah 62:2; 65:15; 56:5]
 THE IGGERET HAKODESH TO THE KEHILLAH AT THYATIRA

18. And to the malach of the Kehillah in Thyatira, write: these things says the Ben HaElohim, the One having his eynayim (eyes) like a flame of aish (fire), [Daniel 7:9] and the feet of him like burnished bronze: [Daniel 10:6]

19. "I have da'as of your ma'asim and the ahavah and the emunah and the Tzedek [Daniel 9:25] and the savlanut (patient endurance) of you, and that your Ma'asim HaAcharonim are more than HaRishonim of you.

20. But I have this against you, that you are being permissive toward that isha Izevel (Jezebel), the one calling herself a nevi'ah (prophetess) who teaches and deceives my avadim to commit zenut and to eat okhel sacrificed to elilim [Melachim Alef 16:31; 21:25; Melachim Bais 9:7-22; Bamidbar 25:1-2]

21. And I gave her time that she might make teshuva and she does not wish to make teshuva of her zenut. [Melachim Alef 16:31; Melachim Bais 9:22; Bamidbar 25:1-2]

22. Hinei!  I am throwing her into a bed, and the ones committing ni'uf (adultery) with her into Tzarah Gedolah (Great Tribulation, Mt.24:21), unless they make teshuva of her ma'asim.

23. And her yeladim I will kill with Mavet, and all the kehillot will have da'as that I am the One searching their klayot valev (conscience and heart), and I will give to you, each one, according to your ma'asim. [Tehillim 7:9; 62:12; 139:1; 2:23; Mishle 21:2; 24:12; Yirmeyah 11:20; 17:10; Shmuel Alef 16:7; Melachim Alef 8:39;]

24. But I say to you, the rest, to the ones in Thyatira, as many as have not this "torah", who did not have da'as of the, as they say, "the tiefe (deep) things of Hasatan"-- I am putting on you no other burden.

25. Al kol panim (nevertheless), what you have, hold fast until I come.

26. And the one who wins the nitzachon (victory) and the one until HaKets keeping shomer of the ma'asim mitzvot of me, him will I give samchut over the Goyim,

27. to rule them with a shevet barzel (scepter of iron, Tehillim 2:9) kikh'li yotzer tenaptzem ("as the vessels of pottery are broken") [Tehillim 2:8,9; Yeshayah 30:14; Yirmeyah 19:11]

28. even as I also have received from HaAv of me and I will give him the Kochav (Star--Bamidar 24:17) haNogah (of Brightness/Venus, II Shimon Kefa 1:19).

29. The one having an ear let him hear what the Ruach Hakodesh says to the Kehillot.

## Revelation 3

1. And to the malach of the Kehillah in Sardis, write: these things says the One having the sheva ruchot of Hashem and the shevat hakokhavim: I have da'as of your ma'asim, that nominally you are Chai but you are niftar.

2. Be shomer and regarding the things remaining and the things on the point of mavet, be chazakim (strong ones). For, I have not found your ma'asim mitzvot having been shleimim before Elohai.

3. Therefore, let there be zikaron (remembrance) of what has been handed over to you and what you heard, and be shomer and make teshuva.  Therefore, if you are not shomer, I will come as a ganav, and never would you have da'as at what sha'ah (hour, time) I will come upon you.

4. But you have a few shmot (names) in Sardis which did not soil their kaftans.  It is they that will walk with me in lavan, wearing a kittel, because they are walking worthily.

5. The one who wins the nitzachon (victory), in similar manner, will be clothed in lavan (white), and never will I blot out the baal shem tov of him from the Sefer Chayyim.  And I will make hoda'ah (confession) the shem of him before Elohim Avi and before the malachim of him.

6. The one having an ear let him hear what the Ruach Hakodesh says to the Kehillot.    THE IGGERET HAKODESH TO THE KEHILLAH AT PHILADELPHIA

7. And to the malach of the Kehillah in Philadelphia, write: these things says HaKadosh, HaAmiti, the One having the mafte'ach (key) of Dovid, the One opening and no one will shut, the one shutting and no one opens: [Yeshayah 22:22]

8. "I have da'as of your ma'asim.  Hinei! I have placed in front of you a delet (door), having been opened, which no one is able to shut.  Because you have a little ko'ach (power) and have been shomer over the dvar of me

9. and did not make hakhchashah (denial) of ha-Shem of me. Hinei! I may make some of the Shul [deluded by] Hasatan, the ones declaring themselves to be Bnei Berit, and are not but speak sheker; hinei! I will make them come and prostrate themselves before your feet and then they will have da'as that I have ahavah for you. [Yeshayah 49:23; 43:4]

10. Because you were shomer over my dvar of savlanut (patient endurance), I will also be shomer over you, guarding you from the sha'at hanisayon (hour of trial) about to come upon the Olam Hazeh, to try all the ones of the inhabited world, all the ones dwelling upon the earth.

11. I am coming quickly; hold fast to what you have, that no one takes the atarah of you.

12. The one who wins the nitzachon (victory) I will make an ammud (pillar) in the Beis Hamikdash of Elohai and never may he go out of it [Tehillim 23:6] and I will write upon him ha-Shem of Elohai and ha-Shem of the Ir Hakodesh of Elohai--the Yerushalayim HaChadasha descending down out of Shomayim from Elohai--and ha-Shem HeChadash of me. [Yechezkel 48:35]

13. The one having an ear let him hear what the Ruach Hakodesh says to the Kehillot.  THE IGGERET HAKODESH TO THE KEHILLAH AT LAODICEA

14. And to the malach of the Kehillah in Laodicea, write: these things says the Omein, the Eidus Hane'eman who is also HaEmes, [Mishle 8:22]

15. the Reshit of the Bri'at Hashem: "I have da'as of your ma'asim, that you are neither kar (cold) nor kham (hot).  Would that you were kar or kham!

16. But because you are posher (lukewarm) and neither kham nor kar, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.

17.  Because you say, I am ashir (rich) and have become wealthy and in nothing am I nitzrach (needy), and you do not have da'as that you are the one wretched and pitiful and poor and blind and naked, [Hoshea 12:8]

18. I counsel you to buy from me gold having been purified by aish (fire) that you may be ashir, and a kittel that you may be clothed in lavan and that the bushah of your nakedness not be made known, and salve to rub on the eynayim (eyes) of you that you may see.

19. Those for whom I have ahavah I reprove and discipline.  Be kham (hot), therefore, in kinat Hashem (zeal for G-d) and make teshuva. [Devarim 8:5; Mishle 3:12]

20.  Hinei! I have stood at the delet (door) dofek (knocking, Shir HaShirim 5:2); if anyone hears my kol and opens the delet, indeed I will come in to him and we, the two of us, will dine together at the Beit HaYayin [Shir HaShirim 2:4].

21. The one who wins the nitzachon (victory), I will give to him to sit with me on the kisseh of me, as I also won the nitzachon and sat with Elohim Avi on the kisseh of him.

22.  The one having an ear let him hear what the Ruach Hakodesh says to the Kehillot.

## Revelation 4

1. After these things I looked, and--hinei!--a delet (door) having been opened in Shomayim, the kol harishon [1:10], the voice like a shofar that I heard speaking to me, said, "Come up here! And I will show you MAH DI LEHEVE ("what will happen," Daniel 2:28f) after these things."

2. At once I was in the Ruach Hakodesh, and--hinei!-- there in Shomayim stood a kisseh, and upon the kisseh DEMUT KEMAREH ADAM ("a figure in appearance like a Man," Yechezkel 1:26-28), [Melachim Alef 22:19; Yeshayah 6:1; Daniel 7:9]

3. and the One sitting was like KEMAREH ("in appearance") jasper stone and carnelian, and a keshet (rainbow, Bereshis 9:16) was around the kisseh that looks like an emerald. [Yechezkel 1:28]

4. And around the kisseh were esrim v'arba'ah kisot (twenty-four thrones) and on the kisaot were sitting esrim v'arba'ah Zekenim, each clothed in lavan, each wearing a kittel, and on the roshim of them, golden atarot (crowns).

5. And out of the kisseh comes forth lightning and sounds and thunders and there were sheva lapidei aish (torches of aish)  burning before the kisseh, which are the sheva ruchot (spirits, 1:4) of Hashem [Shemot 19:16; Zecharyah 4:2].

6. And before the kisseh there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal.  And on each side and around the kisseh there were Arbah Chayyot (four living beings), being full of eynayim in front and in back. [Yechezkel 1:5]

7. And HaRishonah of HaChayyot [Yechezkel 1:10; 1:14] was like an aryeh (lion), and Hasheniyah of HaChayyot like an egel (calf), and HaShlishit of HaChayyot had the face of a ben Adam, 

 MESHORORIM (SINGERS) AROUND THE KISSEH

8. and HaReve'it of HaChayyot was like a flying nesher (eagle).  And the Arba Chayyot, each one of them had six wings, and these wings, around and within were full of eynayim.  And yomam valailah, they do not cease to rest but continue singing, "Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh, Hashem Adonoi Tzvaot, the One who was and is and is to come." [Yeshayah 6:2; Yechezkel 1:18;  Yeshayah 6:3]

9. And whenever the Chayyot will give kavod (glory) and hod (splendor) and hadar (majesty) and shevakh (praise) to the One sitting on the kisseh, to Him that Hu Chai ad olemei olamim, [Tehillim 47:8]

10. Then the esrim v'arba'ah Zekenim fall prostrate before the One sitting on the kisseh and worship the One that Hu Chai ad olemei olamim and cast down the atarot of them before the kisseh, saying, [Devarim 33:3]

11. "Worthy art thou, Adoneinu and Eloheinu, to receive hod (honor) and hadar (splendor) and oz (power), because it was your "barah" that created all things, and because they existed and came to be by your ratzon.

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw on the yad yamin of the One sitting on the kisseh a sefer having been written inside and on the back, having been sealed with sheva chotamot (seven seals). [Yechezkel 2:9,10; Yeshayah 29:11; Daniel 12:4]

2. And I saw a strong malach, proclaiming in a kol gadol, "Who is worthy to open the sefer and break its chotamot?"

3. And no one in Shomayim or on ha'aretz or under ha'aretz was being able to open the sefer or to look into it.

4. And I was weeping copiously because no one was found worthy to open the sefer or to look into it,

5. And one of the Zekenim says to me, "Do not weep, hinei! HaAryeh from the Shevet Yehudah, the Shoresh Dovid, has won the nitzachon (victory) and he is able to open the sefer and its sheva chotamot. [Bereshis 49:9; Yeshayah 11:1,10]

6. And I saw between the kisseh and the Arbah Chayyot and among the Zekenim a Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) having stood as having been slain, having sheva karnayim, sheva eynayim, which are the sheva ruchot (spirits) of Hashem having been sent into kol ha'aretz. [Zecharyah 4:10]

7. And he came and has taken the sefer out of the yad yamim of the One sitting on the kisseh.

8. And when he received the sefer, the Arbah Chayyot and the esrim v'arba'ah Zekenim fell down before the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7), each one having a nevel (harp) and golden ke'arot (bowls) full of ketoret (incense), which are the tefillos (prayers) of the kedoshim; [Tehillim 141:]

9. And they are singing a shir chadash, saying, "Worthy art thou  to take the sefer and to open the chotamot of it, because you were slain and with your dahm [kapparah] you paid the price for the Geulah [Vayikra 25:50-51] redemption and purchased ones for Hashem from every mishpochah (family) and lashon (tongue) and am (people) and goy (nation), [Tehillim 40:3; 98:1; 149:1;  Yeshayah 42:10]

10. and made them for Eloheinu a Malchut and kohanim, and they will reign on ha'aretz.  THE TIFERET (BEAUTY) OF THE NETZAH (VICTORY) OF THE SEH HAELOHIM

11. And I saw and I heard the kol of many malachim around the kisseh and of the Chayyot and the Zekenim; they numbered myriads of myriads and v'alfei alafim (thousands of thousands), [Daniel 7:10]

12. saying with a kol gadol, "Worthy is the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) having been slain, to receive the oz (power) and the osher (wealth) and the chochmah (wisdom) and the gevurah (strength) and hod (honor) and kavod (glory) and brakhah (blessing)."

13. And every beriyah (creature) which is in Shomayim and on ha'aretz and under ha'aretz and on the yam and all things in them, I heard saying, "To the One sitting on the kisseh and to the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) be the brakhah (blessing) and the hod (honor) and the hadar (glory) and the memshalah (dominion) ad Olemei Olamim." [Divrey Hayamim Alef 29:11; Malachi 1:6; 2:2]

14. And the Arbah Chayyot were saying, "Omein."  And the Zekenim fell down and worshiped.

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw when the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) opened one of the sheva chotamot.  And I heard one of the Arbah Chayyot saying, as with a voice of thunder, "Come!"

2. And I saw, and Hinei! a sus lavan (white horse), and the one sitting on it having a keshet (bow, Yechezkel 39:2[3]) and was given to him an atarah (diadem) and he went forth conquering, intent on conquest. [Zecharyah 1:8; 6:3,11; Tehillim 45:4]

3. And when he opened the chotam hasheyni, I heard the Hasheniyah of HaChayyot saying, "Come!"

4. And another sus (horse) went forth, a flame-red one, and to the one sitting on it was given him to take shalom from ha'aretz with men slaughtering one another, and was given to him a cherev gedolah. [Zecharyah 1:8; 6:2]

5. And when he opened the chotam hashlishi, I heard the HaShlishit of HaChayyot, saying, "Come!" And I saw and hinei! A sus shakhor (black horse), and the one sitting on it having a pair of scales in the yad of him. [Zecharyah 6:2]

6. And I heard, as it were, a kol (voice) in the midst of the Arbah Chayyot, saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius and shloshah quarts of barley for a denarius, but the shemen (oil) and the yayin you may not harm." [Yechezkel 4:16]

7. And when he opened the chotam harevi'i, I heard the kol of the HaReve'it of HaChayyot saying, "Come!"

8. And I saw, and hinei! a sus yerakrak (a greenish pale horse), and the one sitting upon it, that rider's name was Mavet, and She'ol was following with him. And there was given to them samchut (authority) over a quarter of ha'aretz, to kill with cherev and with ra'av and with mavet and by the chayyot of ha'aretz. [Zecharyah 6:3; Hoshea 13:14; Yirmeyah 15:2,3; 24:10; Yechezkel 5:12,17]

9. And when he opened the chotam hakhamishi, I saw underneath the Mitzbe'ach (altar) the nefashot (souls) of the ones having died al kiddush Ha-Shem, having been slain as martyrs because of the dvar Hashem and because of their solemn edut (testimony) which they had given. [Shemot 29:12; Vayikra 4:7]

10. And they cried out, saying, "Rabbono shel Olam, HaKadosh and HaAmiti, how much longer is it to be until you judge and avenge dahmeinu on the inhabitants of ha'aretz?" [Tehillim 119:84; Zecharyah 1:12; Devarim 32:43; Melachim Bais 9:7; Tehillim 79:10]

11. And they were each given a kittel (white robe) and it was told them that they will rest yet a little while, until the mispar (number) should be complete of their fellow avadim and their Achim b'Moshiach, the ones about to die al kiddush Ha-Shem, being about to be killed as martyrs as they were.

12. And I saw when he opened the chotam hashishi, a great earthquake occurred and the shemesh (sun) became shakhor as sackcloth made of hair and the whole yare'ach (moon) became like dahm. [Tehillim 97:4; Yeshayah 29:6; Yechezkel 38:19; Yeshayah 50:3]

13. And the kokhavim of the Shomayim fell to ha'aretz, as an aitz te'enah (fig tree) casts off its unripe figs when being shaken by a great wind. [Yeshayah 34:4]

14. And the Shomayim split apart as a megillah scroll being rolled up and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. [Tehillim 46:2; Yeshayah 54:10; Yirmeyah 4:24; Yechezkel 38:20; Nachum 1:5]

15. And the melachim (kings) of ha'aretz and the gedolim and the military leaders and the ashirim (rich men) and the strongmen and all avadim and bnei Chorim hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains. [Yeshayah 2:10,19,21]

16. And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the kisseh and from the za'am (wrath, 16:1f) of the Seh, (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7), [Hoshea 10:8]

17. because the Yom HaGadol, the Yom HaZa'am, the Great Day of Their Wrath has come, and who is able to stand?" [Yoel 1:15; 2:1,2,11,31; Zefanyah 1:14,15; Nachum 1:6; Malachi 3:2]

## Revelation 7

1. After this I saw arba'ah mala'khim taking their stand on the arbah pinnot ha'aretz, holding the arbah ruchot of ha'aretz so that wind should not blow on ha'aretz nor on the yam (sea) nor on any aitz (tree). [Yeshayah 11:12; Yirmeyah 49:36; Yechezkel 37:9; Daniel 7:2; Zecharyah 6:5]

2. And I saw another malach coming up from the rising of the shemesh (sun), having a chotam of the Elohim Chayyim, and he cried with a kol gadol to the four malachim. These were the malachim to whom it was given to harm ha'aretz and hayam,

3. saying, "Do not harm ha'aretz nor hayam nor haaitz, until we have marked with the chotam the avadim (servants) of Eloheinu upon their foreheads. [Yechezkel 9:4]

4. And I heard the mispar of the ones having been sealed, 144,000, having been marked with the chotam from every shivtei Bnei Yisroel,

5. of the shevet of Yehudah, 12,000 having been sealed; of the shevet of Re'uven, 12,000, of the shevet of Gad, 12,000,

6. of the shevet of Asher, 12,000, of the shevet of Naphtali, 12,000, of the shevet of M'nasheh, 12,000,

7. of the shevet of Shim'on, 12,000, of the shevet of Levy, 12,000, of the shevet of Yissass'khar, 12,000,

8. of the shevet of Z'vulun, 12,000, of the shevet of Yosef, 12,000, of the shevet of Binyamin, 12,000,  HALELU ES HASHEM KOL GOYIM (TEHILLIM 117:1): THE MULTITUDE FROM KOL HAUMMIM (ALL THE PEOPLES)

9. After these things I looked, and hinei!, a great multitude, which to number no one was being able, out of every nation and from shvateem and haummim (the peoples) and lashonot (tongues), standing before the kisseh and before the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7), each clothed with a kittel and lulavim in their hands.

10. And they cry with a kol gadol, saying, "Yeshu'at Eloheinu is of Hashem, our G-d, the One sitting on the kisseh, and of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7)."

11. And all the malachim stood around the kisseh and the Zekenim and the Arbah Chayyot and they fell before the kisseh on their faces and they worshiped Hashem, saying, [Tehillim 3:8]

12. "Omein, the brakhah (blessing) and the kavod (glory) and the chochmah (wisdom) and the hadayah (thanksgiving) and the hod (honor) and the oz (power) and the gevurah (strength) be to Hashem Eloheinu l'Olelamei Olamim. Omein."

13. And one of the Zekenim answered, saying to me, "These ones, each wearing a kittel, who are they and from where did they come?"

14. And I said to him, "Adoni, you have da'as." And he said to me, "These are the ones coming out of HaTzarah HaGedolah (The Great Tribulation, Mt.24:29f) and each washed his kittel and whitened it in the dahm of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7).

15. Therefore, they are before the kisseh of Hashem and serve Him yomam valailah in His Beis Hamikdash, and the One sitting on the kisseh will pitch the tent of His Mishkan over them. [Yeshayah 4:5]

16. they will hunger no more nor thirst nor shall the shemesh (sun) strike them nor any scorching heat, [Yeshayah 49:10]

17. because the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) at the center of the kisseh, will shepherd them and will lead them to the Makor Mayim Chayyim ["Fount, source of Living Waters," Yirmeyah 2:13], and Hashem will wipe away every tear from their eynayim." [Yeshayah 25:8; 35:10; 51:11; 65:19]

## Revelation 8

1. And when the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) opened the chotam hashevi'i, there was silence in Shomayim about half an hour.

2. And I saw the shivat hamalachim who stand before Hashem, and there were given to them shivah shofarot.

3. And another malach came and stood at the Mitzbe'ach (altar), having a golden makhtah (incense bowl), and there was given to him much ketoret (incense, Tehillim 141:2) to offer with the tefillos (prayers) of all the kedoshim at the golden Mitzbe'ach (altar) before the kisseh. [Shemot 30:1-6]

4. And the smoke of the ketoret ascended with the tefillos of the kedoshim out of the hand of the malach before Hashem. [Tehillim 141:2]

5. And the malach has taken the makhtah and filled it from the aish (fire) of the Mitzbe'ach (altar) and he threw it down to ha'aretz, and there were thunders and sounds and lightning and an earthquake. [Vayikra 16:12,13]  THE SHOFAROT

6. And the shivat hamalachim having the shiva shofarot prepared themselves that they might sound the shofarot.

7. And HaRishon sounded his shofar; and there came barad (hail) and aish (fire) having been mingled with dahm and it was thrown to  ha'aretz, and a third of ha'aretz was burnt up, and a third of the aitz was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up. [Yechezkel 38:22]

8. And the Malach HaSheyni sounded his shofar; and as it were a great mountain with aish (fire) burning was thrown into the yam, and a third of the yam became dahm [Yirmeyah 51:25]

9. And a third of the living yetzurim hayam (creatures of the sea) died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

10. And the Malach HaShelishi sounded his shofar; and fell out of Shomayim a kokhav gadol blazing as a torch and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the wells of mayim, [Yeshayah 14:12]

11. And the name of the kokhav is said to be "Wormwood," and a third of the mayim became bitter wormwood, and many of the bnei Adam died from the mayim because the mayim were made bitter. [Yirmeyah 9:15, 23:15]

12. And the Malach HaRevi'i sounded his shofar; and a third of the shemesh (sun) was struck and a third of the yare'ach (moon) and a third of the kokhavim, that a third of them might be darkened, and the yom could not appear, and likewise the lailah. [Shemot 10:21-23; Yechezkel 32:7]

13. And I saw, and I heard one nesher (eagle) flying in midair, saying with a kol gadol, "Oy, oy, oy to the ones dwelling on ha'aretz, because of the remaining blasts of the shofar of the shloshet hamalachim being about to sound.

## Revelation 9

1. And the Malach HaKhamishi sounded his shofar; and I saw a kokhav having fallen out of Shomayim to ha'aretz.  And was given to it the mafte'ach of the shaft of the Tehom (Abyss).

2. And he opened the shaft of the Tehom (Abyss), and smoke rose out of the shaft as smoke of a great furnace, and the shemesh was darkened and the air was darkened by the smoke of the shaft. [Bereshis 19:28; Shemot 19:18; Yoel 2:2,10]

3. And out of the smoke came forth arbeh (locusts) to ha'aretz, and samchut (authority) was given to them like the samchut of the akrabei ha'aretz (scorpions of the earth). [Shemot 10:12-15]

4. And it was told them that they should not harm the grass of  ha'aretz nor any greenery nor any aitz, except the bnei Adam, all who do not have the chotam of Hashem on their foreheads.

5. And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they will be tormented chamishah chadashim (five months). Their torment is as the torment of an akrav (scorpion) when it strikes a man.

6. And in those days bnei Adam will seek Mavet and by no means will find it.  And they will desire to die and Mavet flees from them. [Iyov 3:21; 7:15; Yirmeyah 8:3]

7. And the appearances of the arbeh (locusts) were like susim (horses) having been prepared for milchamah (war), and on the heads of them what looked like atarot (diadems) of gold and the faces were like the faces of bnei Adam. [Yoel 2:4; Daniel 7:8]

8. And they had hair that looked like the hair of an isha, and they had teeth that looked like the teeth of an aryeh, [Yoel 1:6]

9. and they had breastplates like iron breastplates and the sound of the wings of them was as the sound of many merkavot (chariots) with susim racing into the sdeh krav (battlefield), [Yoel 2:5]

10. And they have tails like akrabim (scorpions), with stingers, and the ko'ach (power) of them is in their tails to harm bnei Adam chamishah chadashim (five months).

11. They have over them a melech, the malach of the Tehom (Abyss), the name for him in Ivrit, "Abaddon," (that is, Destruction) and in Elliniki he has the name Apollyon (that is, "Destroyer"). [Iyov 26:6; 28:22; 31:12; Tehillim 88:11]

12. The Oy Echad (Woe #1) has passed; Hinei! yet comes two more woes after these things.

13. And the Malach HaShishi sounded his shofar. And I heard one kol from the four horns of the golden Mitzbe'ach (altar) before Hashem, [Shemot 30:1-3]

14. saying to the Malach Hashishi, the one having the shofar, "Release the arba'at hamalachim having been bound at the great river, Euphrates. [Bereshis 15:18; Devarim 1:7; Yehoshua 1:4; Yeshayah 11:15]

15. And the arba'at hamalachim were released, having been prepared for the sha'ah and the yom and chodesh and shanah, that they should kill a third of bnei Adam.

16. And the mispar (number) of tziveot haparashim (troops of cavalry-men) were twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard the mispar of them.

17. And thus I saw the susim in my chazon (vision, revelation, prophecy) and the riders on them, having breastplates fiery red and hyacinth blue and sulfur yellow, and the heads of the susim like heads of arayot (lions), and from the mouths of them goes forth aish (fire) and smoke and gofrit (sulfur). [Tehillim 11:6; Yeshayah 30:33; Yechezkel 38:22]

18. From these shlosh hamakkot (three plagues) were killed a third of bnei Adam, by the aish (fire) and the smoke and the gofrit (sulfur) coming out of the mouth of them.

19. For the ko'ach (power) of the susim is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like nekhashim (serpents), having heads, and with them they inflict harm.

20. And the rest of the bnei Adam, the ones not killed by these makkot (plagues), did not make teshuva and turn from the ma'asim of their hands or forsake worship of shedim and the atzavim (idols, images, tzelamim), those of gold and of silver and of bronze and of stone and of wood, which neither are able to see nor to hear nor to walk. [Devarim 4:28; 31:29; Yirmeyah 1:16; Michoh 5:13]

21. And they did not make teshuva (repentance, turning from sin to G-d) of the retzseekhot (murders) of them nor of the kishufim (sorceries) of them nor of the zenunim (fornication) of them nor of the gneyvot (thefts) of them. [Yeshayah 47:9,12]

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another strong malach descending and coming down out of Shomayim, having been wrapped in an anan (cloud), and the keshet (rainbow, Bereshis 9:16) was over his rosh and the face of him was as the shemesh (sun) and the feet of him as pillars of aish, [Yechezkel 1:28]

2. and he had in his hand a sefer katan which had been opened and he placed his ragel hayemanit (right foot) on the yam, and the smolit (left) on ha'aretz,

3. and he cried with a kol gadol as an aryeh roars. And when he shouted, the shivat hare'amim (seven thunders) reverberated. [Hoshea 11:10]

4. And when the shivat hare'amim spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a kol min haShomayim, saying, "Put a chotam on [the sod, the secret of] what the shivat hare'amim have spoken, and seal it up, and do not write, [Daniel 8:26; 12:4,9]

5. And the malach, whom I saw having taken his stand on the yam and on ha'aretz, lifted his yad yamin to Shomayim [Devarim 32:40; Daniel 12:7]

6. and swore by the One who lives l'Olmei Olamim (forever and ever)--whose " barah" (created) the Shomayim and the things in it and ha'aretz and the things in it and the yam and the things in it--that shahut (delay) will be no longer. [Bereshis 14:22; Shemot 6:8; Bamidbar 14:30; Tehillim 115:15; 146:6]

7. But in the days of the sounding of the shofar by the Malach Hashlishit, when he is about to blow the shofar, also the raz (mystery) of Hashem would be completed, as he proclaimed to his avadim (servants), the nevi'im (prophets). [Amos 3:7]

8. And the kol (voice) which I heard from Shomayim was again speaking with me and saying, "Go, take the sefer which is opened in the hand of the malach who has taken his stand on the yam and on the ha'aretz.

9. And I went to the malach, telling him to give me the sefer katan and he says to me, "Take and eat it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as devash (honey)."  [Yirmeyah 15:16; Yechezkel 2:8-3:3]

10. And I took the sefer katan out of the hand of the malach and ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as devash, but, when I ate, my stomach was made bitter.

11. And they say to me, "You must speak dvarim hanevu'ah again, about amim (peoples) and goyim (nations) and leshonot (tongues) and many melachim (kings). [Yechezkel 37:4,9; Daniel 3:4]

## Revelation 11

1. And a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, "Come and measure the Beis Hamikdash of Hashem and the Mitzbe'ach (altar) and the ones worshiping there. [Yechezkel 40:3]

2. But do not measure the outer court of the Beis Hamikdash; leave that out, and measure it not, for it was given over to the Goyim, and the Ir HaKodesh they will trample upon arba'im and shenayim chodashim. [Yechezkel 40:17,20; Daniel 7:25; 12:7]

3. And I will give to my Sh'ney HaEdim and they will speak  dvarim haNevu'ah one thousand two hundred and sixty days, having been clothed in sakkim (sackcloth). [Bereshis 37:34; Shmuel Bais 3:31; Nechemyah 9:1]

4. These are the two olive trees and the two menorot standing before the Adon kol ha'aretz. [Tehillim 52:8; Yirmeyah 11:16; Zecharyah 4:3,11,14]

5. And if anyone wants to harm them, aish (fire) comes out of their mouth and destroys their oyevim (enemies); and if anyone wants to harm them, it is necessary for him to be killed like this. [Shmuel Bais 22:9; Melachim Bais 1:10; Yirmeyah 5:14; Bamidbar 16:29,35]

6. These have the samchut (authority) to shut Shomayim, that no geshem (rain) may fall during the days of the nevu'ah (prophecy) of them. And samchut (authority) they have over the waters to  turn them into dahm and to strike ha'aretz with makkot of every kind, as often as they want.  [Shemot 7:17,19 [Melachim Alef 17:1]

7. And when they complete the edut (testimony) of them, the Chayyah (Beast) coming up from the Tehom (Abyss) will make war with them and will conquer them and will kill them. [Daniel 7:21]

8. And the NEVELAH (corpse, Devarim 21:23) of them will be on  the rehkov (street) of the Ir Hagadol, which is called spiritually S'dom and Mitzrayim (Egypt), where also Adonoi of  them was pierced on the aitz. [Yeshayah 1:9; Yirmeyah 13:14; Yechezkel 16:46]

9. And some of the amim (peoples) and shvateem (tribes) and leshonot (tongues) and goyim (nations) see the NEVELAH of them for shloshah and a half yamim and the NEVELAH of them they do not permit to be put into a kever (tomb). [Tehillim 79:2,3]

10. And the ones dwelling on ha'aretz rejoice with great simcha over them and make merry and they will send matanot (gifts) to  one another, because these two nevi'im (prophets) tormented the  ones dwelling on ha'aretz. [Nechemyah 8:10,12; Esther 9:19,22]

11. And after the shloshah and a half yamim, a Ruach of Chayyim from Hashem entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and pakhad gadol fell upon the ones seeing them. [Yechezkel 37:5,9,10,14]

12. And they heard a kol gadol out of Shomayim saying to them, "Come up here!"  And they went up into Shomayim in the anan  (cloud), and their oyevim (enemies) saw them. [Melachim Bais 2:11]

13. And in that hour occurred a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and there were killed in the earthquake shivat alafim names among bnei Adam, and the rest became afraid and gave kavod (glory) to Elohei HaShomayim.

14. The Second Woe passed. Hinei! The Third Woe is coming quickly.  HASHOFAR HASHEVI'I

15. And the Malach HaShevi'i sounded his shofar. And there were kolot gedolim (loud voices) in Shomayim, saying, "The Malchut of the Olam Hazeh became the Malchut of Adoneinu and of His Moshiach, and He will reign l'Olemei Olamim. [Tehillim 145:13; Daniel 2:44; 7:14,27; Michoh 4:7; Zecharyah 14:9]

16. And the esrim v'arba'ah Zekenim sitting on their kisot before Hashem fell on their faces and worshiped Hashem,

17. saying, "Modim Anachnu, Adonoi Eloheinu, El Shaddai, the One who is and the One who was, because you have taken your oz gadol and reigned. [Tehillim 30:12]

18. And the goyim (nations) raged. And your chori af came, and the time for the Mesim to be judged and for giving the sachar  (reward) to your avadim (servants), the nevi'im (prophets) and  the kedoshim and the ones fearing ha-Shem of you, the ketanim and  the Gedolim, and for destroying the ones destroying ha'aretz. [Tehillim 2:1]

19. And the Beis Hamikdash of Hashem was opened in Shomayim, and the Aron HaBrit of Hashem was seen in the Beis Hamikdash of Hashem. And there were flashes of lightning and kolot and thunders and an earthquake and great hail. [Shemot 25:10-22; Divrey Hayamim Bais 5:7]

## Revelation 12

1. And an ot gadol (miraculous sign) was seen in Shomayim, an ISHA (Bereshis 3:15) having been clothed with the shemesh (sun), and the yare'ach (moon) underneath the feet of her, and on the rosh of her an atarah (diadem) of kokhavim numbering Sheneym  Asar, [Bereshis 37:9]

2. And in her womb having a YELED (CHILD, YESHAYAH 9:5), and she cries out, suffering CHEVLEI and being in pain to give birth.  [Yeshayah 26:17]

3. And another ot (miraculous sign) was seen in Shomayim.  And --hinei!-- a great red Dragon NACHASH (BERESHIS 3:1), having  sheva (seven) heads and eser (ten) horns and on the heads of it   sheva (seven) keterim (crowns). [Daniel 7:7,20]

4. And the tail of him drags down a third of the kokhavim of  Shomayim and threw them to ha'aretz, and the Dragon Nachash was  standing before the Isha who was about to give birth, that when  she gives birth to the YELED (YESHAYAH 9:5) of her, he might devour the YELED. [Daniel 8:10]

5. And she gave birth to a BEN (YESHAYAH 9:5), a zachar (male), who is about to shepherd all the Goyim (Nations) with a shevet  barzel (scepter of iron, Tehillim 2:9), and the YELED of the ISHA was snatched up to Hashem and to His kisseh.

6. And the Isha fled into the wilderness, where she has there a place having been prepared by Hashem, that there she can be  nourished a thousand two hundred and sixty yamim.

7. And there was milkhamah (war) in Shomayim, Mikha'el and the malachim of him fought against the Dragon Nachash, and the Dragon Nachash and his malachim fought back.

8. But the Dragon Nachash was not strong enough nor was any  place found for them any longer in Shomayim.

9. And the great Dragon, that Nachash Kadmon was thrown down, the one being called the Malshin (Slanderer) and Hasatan, the one  deceiving the whole inhabited world. He was thrown to ha'aretz and the malachim of him were thrown down with him. [Bereshis 3:1-7]

10. And I heard a kol gadol in Shomayim, saying, "Now has come the Yeshu'at Eloheinu and the Gevurah and the Malchut of Hashem  Eloheinu and the memshelet (government) of His Moshiach, because the Malshin who is the accuser of our Achim b'Moshiach, the one accusing them before Hashem yomam valailah was thrown down. [Iyov 1:9-11; Zecharyah 3:1]

11. And they won the nitzachon (victory) over him because of the dahm [kapporah] of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) and because of  the dvar of the edut (testimony) of them and because they did not have ahavah for their neshamot unto Mavet and were willing to die  al kiddush Hashem.

12. Therefore be glad, Shomayim, and the ones whose mishkan is there, but oy to ha'aretz and to hayam, because Hasatan came down to you, having great ka'as (anger), having da'as that his time is short. [Tehillim 96:11; Yeshayah 44:23; 49:13]

13. And when the Dragon Nachash saw that he was thrown to ha'aretz, he brought redifah (persecution) on the Isha who gave  birth to the zachar.

14. And two wings of the Nesher hagadol were given to the Isha, that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is  nourished there for a time and times and half a time, away from the presence of the Nachash. [Shemot 19:4; Daniel 7:25; 12:7]

15. And the Nachash spewed after the Isha from its mouth mayim as a river, that he might make her carried away by a river.

16. And ha'aretz aided the Isha and ha'aretz opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the Dragon Nachash spewed out of  its mouth.

17. And the Dragon Nachash had great ka'as at the Isha and went away to make milkhamah (war) with the rest of her ZERA (seed, Bereshis 3:15, Yeshayah 53:10), the ones keeping the mitzvot of  Hashem and having the edut (testimony) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  And then the Dragon Nachash took his stand on the seashore sand of the yam.

## Revelation 13

1. And I saw out of the yam a Chayyah coming up, having eser  horns and sheva heads and on the horns of it asarah (ten) diadems and on the heads of it names of Chillul Hashem gidufim (blasphemies). [Daniel 7:1-6; 11:36]

2. And the Chayyah which I saw was like a namer (leopard) and the feet of it as a dov (bear) and the mouth of it as the mouth of an aryeh and the Dragon Nachash gave to it its ko'ach and  its kisseh and great samchut (authority). [Daniel 7:6,5,4]

3. And one of its roshim seemed to have received a mortal wound and to have been slain, and the wound causing its mavet was  healed, and kol ha'aretz marveled, following after the Chayyah.

4. And they worshiped the Dragon Nachash, because he gave his memshalah (governing authority) to the Chayyah, and they worshiped the Chayyah, saying, "Who is like the Chayyah?" "And who is able to make war with it?" [Shemot 15:11]

5. And a PEH [Daniel 7:8,20] was given to it saying haughty  words and Chillul Hashem gidufim (blasphemies), and was given to  it ko'ach to act for shnayim and aba'im (two and forty) chodashim [Daniel 7:8,11,20,25; 11;36].

6. And it opened the PEH of it in Chillul Hashem gidufim (blasphemies) against Hashem to blaspheme ha-Shem of him and the Mishkan of him, that is, the ones tabernacling in Shomayim.

7. And was given to it to make milkhamah (war) with the kedoshim and to overcome the kedoshim, and was given to it samchut (authority) over every shevet and am and lashon and goy. [Daniel 7:21]

8. And all the ones dwelling on ha'aretz will worship it, whose name has not been written in the Sefer HaChayyim of the Seh  (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) having been slain from lifnei hivvased tevel (before the foundaiton of the world).

9. If anyone has an ear let him hear.

10. If anyone is to go LA'SHVEE (into captivity) into LA'SHVEE (captivity) he goes. If anyone is to be killed by a cherev, he by a cherev is to be killed.  Here is the savlanut (patient endurance) and the emunah of the kedoshim. [Yirmeyah 15:2; 43:11]

11. And I saw another Chayyah coming up out of ha'aretz, and it had shtey horns like a Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7), and it was speaking like a Dragon Nachash.

12. And all the samchut (authority) of the Chayyah HaRishonah it exercises on its behalf, and it causes ha'aretz and the ones  dwelling on it to worship the Chayyah HaRishonah whose wound of death was healed.

13. And it does otot gedolim, even making aish (fire) come down out of Shomayim to ha'aretz before bnei Adam. [Melachim Alef  18:38; Melachim Bais 1:10]

14. And it leads kol ha'aretz into hona'ah (deception) because  of the otot which were given to it to perform before the Chayyah, telling the ones dwelling on ha'aretz to make an Etzev (idol, image, PESEL, graven image, tzelem, Yeshayah 21:9) to the Chayyah who has the wound of the cherev and yet came alive again.

15. And it was given to it to give breath to the Etzev (idol, image, PESEL, graven image, tzelem, Yeshayah 21:9) of the Chayyah that the Etzev of the Chayyah might even speak and might cause  that as many as would not worship the Etzev of the Chayyah to be killed and to die al kiddush Hashem. [Daniel 3:3-6]

16. And it causes all, the ketanim and the Gedolim, both the ashirim and aniyim, the bnei Chorim and avadim, that to them  should be given a tav [mark] on the yad yamim and on the metsakh (forehead) of them,

17. and that no one should be able to buy or to sell except the one having the tav [mark], the name of the Chayyah or the number of its name.  RECHEN (CALCULATE) THE GEMATRIA TO DISCOVER THE IDENTITY OF THE ANTI-MOSHIACH: NOON, RESH, CHOLAM-VAV, FINAL NOON (NERO) PLUS KOOF, SAMECH, RESH (CAESAR) = SHESH ME'OT V'SHISHIM VASHESH (666)

18. Here is chochmah: the one having binah, let him do the  gematria and get the mispar of the Chayyah, for it is the mispar of the ish [Anti-Moshiach], and the mispar of it is SHESH ME'OT  V'SHISHIM VASHESH.

## Revelation 14

1. And I looked, and --hinei!-- the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) having taken his stand on Mount Tziyon and with him the 144,000  having ha-Shem of him and ha-Shem of HaAv of him which had been  written on the metsakhim of them.

2. And I heard a sound out of Shomayim as a sound of mayim  rabbim and as a sound of ra'am gadol, and the sound which I heard  was as of players of the nevel (harp) playing on their nevalim.

3. And they sing as it were a Shir Chadash before the kisseh and before the Arbah Chayyot and the Zekenim, and no one was being able to learn the Shir except the 144,000, the ones for whom the  [kapparah] price had been paid for their Geulah [Vayikra 5:50-51] redemption, the ones having been purchased from kol ha'aretz.

4. These are those who with nashim are not tameh (unclean, defiled), bochrim ki betullim they are, for these are the ones following  the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) wherever He goes. These chasidim had the [kapparah] price paid for their Geulah [Vayikra 25:50-51] redemption, the ones having been purchased from bnei Adam as the bikkurim to Hashem and to the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah  53:7). [Yirmeyah 2:3]

5. And in the peh of them was not found sheker; they are without mumim (defects). [Tehillim32:2; Zefanyah 3:13]  THE DVARIM OF THE MALACHEY HASHARET

6. And I saw another malach flying midair in Shomayim, having  the eternal Besuras HaGeulah to proclaim to the ones sitting on ha'aretz and to every goy and shevet and lashon and am,

7. saying in a kol gadol, "Have yirat Shomayim toward Hashem and  give him kavod (glory), because the hour of the Yom HaMishpat of him has come.  And worship him, HaBoreh HaShomayim and HaAretz (the creator of Heaven and Earth) and Yam and ma'ayanot (springs, sources) of mayim. [Tehillim 34:9]

8. And another malach, Sheyni (a Second one), followed, saying, "NAFLAH, NAFLAH BABEL ("Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great", Yeshayah 21:9), who of the yayin of the ta'avah of her zenunim  has made all the goyim to drink. [Yirmeyah 51:8]

9. And another malach, Shlishi (a Third one), followed them saying, in a kol gadol, "If anyone worships the Chayyah [Anti-Moshiach] and the Etzev (idol, image, PESEL, graven image, tzelem, Yeshayah 21:9) of it and receives a mark on the metsakh (forehead) of him or on the yad of him,

10. such will drink of the yayin of the Chori Af of Hashem, having been mixed undiluted in the kos (cup) of his Chori Af,  and such will be tormented by aish (fire) and gofrit (sulfur) before malachim hakedoshim and before the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7). [Yeshayah 51:17; Yirmeyah 25:15; 51:7]

11. And the smoke of their torment ascends l'Olmei Olamim, and for them there is no menuchah yomam valailah, none for the ones worshiping the Chayyah and the Etzev of it nor for anyone who  receives the mark of the name of it! [Yeshayah 34:10]

12. Here is the savlanut (patient endurance) of the kedoshim, the ones being shomer over the mitzvot of Hashem, who hold fast to the [orthodox Jewish] emunah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

13. And I heard a kol out of Shomayim saying, "Write: Ashrey are the Mesim, the ones dying in Adoneinu, from now on." "Ken," says the Ruach Hakodesh, "so that they will rest from the ma'asim of  them, for the ma'asim of them are accompanying them."
 THE KATZIR HA'ARETZ

14. And I looked, and --hinei!-- an anan (cloud) lavan (white), and on the anan there was One sitting like the Ben HaAdam having  on the head of him a golden Keter (Crown) and in the yad of him a sharp MAGGAL (sickle, Yoel 3:13). [Hoshea 6:11; Daniel 7:13]

15. And another malach came out of the Beis Hamikdash, crying  with a kol gadol to the One sitting on the anan, "Put forth your MAGGAL (sickle, Yoel 3:13) and reap, because the hour to reap has come, because the Katzir Ha'Aretz is ripe!" [Yirmeyah 51:33]

16. And the One sitting on the anan put forth his MAGGAL (sickle, Yoel 3:13) on ha'aretz and ha'aretz was reaped.

17. And another malach came out of the Beis Hamikdash in  Shomayim, having also with him a sharp MAGGAL (sickle, Yoel  3:13).

18. And another malach came out of the Mitzbe'ach (altar), having shilton (authority) over the aish, and he spoke with a kol gadol to the One having the sharp MAGGAL, saying, "Put forth your  sharp MAGGAL and gather the clusters of the gefen (vine) of  ha'aretz, because the grapes of it are ripe."

19. And the malach put forth the MAGGAL of him to ha'aretz and gathered the vintage of ha'aretz and threw it into the GAT hagedolah (great winepress, Yoel 3:13, cf Yeshayah 63:3) of the Chori Af of Hashem.

20. And the GAT hagedolah was trodden on outside the Ir (City) and dahm came out from the GAT up to the bridles of the susim for about two hundred miles. [Yeshayah 63:3; Yoel3:13; Bereshis 49:11; Devarim 32:14]

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another ot (miraculous sign) in Shomayim, great and marvelous, shiva (seven) malachim having sheva (seven) hamakkot (plagues), the last ones, because by them is completed the Chori Af Hashem. [Vayikra 26:21]

2. And I saw as it were a glassy yam, having been mingled with aish (fire) and I saw the menatzakhat (overcomers) of the Chayyah and of the Etzev of it and of the mispar of the name of it and I saw them having taken their stand on the glassy yam, holding nevalim of Hashem.

3. And they sing the Shir of Moshe Rabbeinu, the eved Hashem, and the Shir of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7), saying, "Great and marvelous are the ma'asim of you, Hashem Adonoi Tzva'ot; tzedek and Emes are the derakhim of you, the Melech kol HaGoyim. [Shemot 15:1; Yehoshua 1:1; Tehillim 111:2; 145:17]

4. Adonoi, who would not fear You and ascribe kavod to your Name? Because you only are HaKadosh, for kol HaGoyim will come and will worship before you because your tzedakot (righteous acts) were made known. [Yirmeyah 10:7; Tehillim 86:9; Yeshayah 66:23]

5. And after these things I looked, and the Heikhal was opened, that is, the Mishkan HaEdut in Shomayim. [Shemot 38:21; Bamidbar 1:50]

6. And the shivat hamalachim having the sheva hamakkot came out of the Heikhal, having been clothed in linen, tahor (clean) and bright, and having been wrapped around the chests with golden gartels. [Yechezkel 9:2; Daniel 10:5]

7. And one of the Arbah Chayyot gave to the shivat hamalachim golden ke'arot (bowls) being full of the Chori Af Hashem HaElohim HaChai l'olemei olamim.

8. And the Heikhal was filled with smoke from the kavod (glory) of Hashem and from the oz (power) of him, and no one was being able to enter into the Heikhal until should be completed the sheva hamakkot (plagues) of the shivat hamalachim. [Yeshayah 6:4; Shemot 40:34,35; Melachim Alef 8:10,11; Divrey Hayamim Bais 5:13,14]

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a kol gadol out of Heikhal saying to the shivat hamalachim, "Go and pour out the sheva ke'arot (bowls) of the Chori Af of Hashem onto ha'aretz. [Tehillim 79:6; Zefanyah 3:8]

2. And HaRishon departed and poured out his ke'ara (bowl) onto ha'aretz, and a bad and rah (evil) sore came on the bnei Adam having the mark of the Chayyah and the ones worshiping the Etzev of it. [Shemot 9:9-11; Devarim 28:35]

3. And HaSheyni poured out his ke'ara (bowl) onto the yam. It became like the dahm of a niftar, and  every living thing in the yam died. [Shemot 7:17-21]

4. And HaShlishi poured out his ke'ara onto the neharot (rivers) and the ma'ayonot (springs) of the mayim, and it became dahm. [Shemot 7:7-21]

5. And  I heard the malach of the mayim saying, "Tzaddik art Thou, the One who is, the One who was, HaKadosh, because you   have judged these things,

6. because the dahm of the kedoshim and the nevi'im they shed and Thou hast given them dahm to drink!  They are deserving of it!" [Yeshayah 49:26]

7. And I heard the Mitzbe'ach (altar) speak, saying, "Ken, Hashem, Adonoi Tzva'ot, Emes and Tzedek are Your Mishpatim (Judgments)."

8. And HaRevi'i poured out his ke'ara (bowl) onto the shemesh (sun), and it was given to the shemesh to scorch bnei Adam with aish.

9. And bnei Adam were scorched with khom gadol, and they spoke Chillul Hashem gidufim (blasphemies) against ha-Shem of G-d, the One having the shilton (authority) over these makkot (plagues) and did not make teshuva to give Him kavod (glory).

10. And HaKhamishi poured out his ke'ara (bowl) on the kisseh of the Chayyah, and the Malchut of the Chayyah became darkened, and in agony they were gnawing their tongues. [Shemot 10:21-23; Yeshayah 8:22]

11. And they spoke Chillul Hashem gidufim (blasphemies) against Elohei HaShomayim because of their agony and because of their sores and they did not make teshuva from their ma'asim.

12. And HaShishi poured out his ke'ara (bowl) on the nahar hagadol, the Euphrates, and the mayim of it was dried up, that might be prepared the derech (way) of the melachim (kings) from the rising of the shemesh (sun). [Yeshayah 11:15,16; 41:2; 46:11]

13. And I saw coming out of the PEH (mouth) of the Dragon Nachash and out of the PEH of the Chayyah and out of the PEH of the Navi Sheker shalosh ruchot teme'ot (three unclean spirits) like tzfarde'im (frogs) [Shemot 8:6]

14. for they are ruchot (spirits) of shedim (demons) performing otot, which go forth to the melachim (kings) of kol ha'aretz to gather them to the krav (battlefield) of the Yom HaGadol of Hashem Adonoi Tzva'ot.

15. --Hinei!--, I am coming as unexpectantly as a ganav. Ashrey is the one watching and keeping his kittel, lest he walk naked and they see his bushah.

16.  And they gathered them into the place being called in Ivrit, Har Megiddo. [Shofetim 5:19; Melachim Bais 23:29,30; Zecharyah 12:11]

17. And HaShevi'i poured out his ke'ara (bowl) on the air, and came a kol gadol out of the Heikhal from the kisseh saying, "It is fahrtik (finished)!"

18.  And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and re'amim (thunder), and a horrendous earthquake occurred such as never did occur vi-bahlt (since) bnei Adam were on ha'aretz, so mighty an earthquake, so violent. [Daniel 12:1]

19.  And Ir HaGedolah became split into thirds and the cities of the goyim (nations) fell. And Hashem remembered Babel haGedolah, to give her the kos (cup) of the yayin of the Chori Af of him.

20. And every island fled, and mountains were not found.

21. And great seventy-pound hailstones come down from Shomayim, on bnei Adam, and bnei Adam spoke Chillul Hashem gidufim (blasphemies) against Hashem because of the makah (plague) of the hailstones, because the makah of it is gedolah me'od. [Yechezkel 13:13; 38:22; Shemot 9:23-25]

## Revelation 17

1. And one of the shivat hamalachim having the sheva hamakkot (plagues) came and spoke with me saying, Bo! I will show you the mishpat (judgment) of the Zonah HaGedolah (the Great Prostitute) sitting on rabbim mayim, [Yeshayah 23:17; Yirmeyah 51:13]

2. with whom the melachim of kol ha'aretz have committed zenut (fornication) and with the yayin of whose zenut kol ha'aretz has fallen into shichrut (drunkenness).

3. And he carried me away into the midbar in Ruach Hakodesh, and  I saw an Isha sitting on a scarlet Chayyah (Anti-Moshiach) being filled with names of Chillul Hashem, gidufim, having sheva (seven) heads and eser horns.

4.  And the Isha  had been clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having a golden kos (cup) in her hand and the kos was full of the abominations and the uncleanesses of her zenut. [Yechezkel 28:13; Yirmeyah 51:7]

5. And on her metsakh a name had been writren, SOD (mystery, RAZ), BAVEL HAGEDOLAL, Em (Mother) of the zonot (prostitutes) and shikkutzim of ha'aretz.

6. And I saw the Isha being drunk from the dahm of the kedoshim and from the dahm of the edim (witnesses) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. And when I saw her, I was struck with great wonder.

7.  And the malach, said to me, "Why did you marvel? I will tell you the  Sod HaIsha (the mystery, raz of the woman And of the Chayyah having the sheva (seven) heads And the eser horns  carring her.

8. "The Chayyah, which you saw, was and is not, and is about to come up out of the Tehom (Abyss) and goes to destruction and the ones dwelling on ha'aretz, whose names have not been found written in the sefer ha chayyim from the hivvased haolam, will be  in awe seeing the Chayyah that was, and is not, and is to come.

9. "This calls for a mind having chochmah. The sheva (seven) heads are sheva (seven) mountains. On these the Isha is sitting. also, they are shiva (seven) melachim (kings);

10. "chamesh of whom have fallen, One is living, and the other did not yet come; and when he comes, it is necessary for him to remain a little time.

11. "And the Chayyah which was and is not, even he is Hashemini but belongs to Hashivah and goes to destruction.

12. "And the eser horns which you saw are asarah melachim (kings who have not yet recieved a malchut, but they are to recieve samchut (authority) as melachim (kings) for one hour, together with the chayyah (Anti-Moshiach).

13. "these are united in yielding their power And samchut (authority) to the Chayyah (Anti-Moshiach).

14. "These with the Seh (Lamb,Yeshayah 53:7) will make milkhamah (war), and the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) will conquer them, because he is Adon HaAdonim and melach hamelachim, and the ones with him are called Nivcharim v'Ne'emanim.

15. "And he says to me, "The mayim which you saw, where the zonah sits, are amim (peoples) and multitudes and goyim (nations) and leshonot (tongues). [Yeshayah 8:7; Yirmeyah 47:2]

16. "And  the eser horns which you saw and the Chayyah (Anti-Moshiach) will have sin'ah (hatred) for the zonah and they will make her desolate and naked and will eat her basar and will burn her up in aish. [Yechezkel 16:37,39]

17. "For Hashem has put it into the levavot of them to accomplish his purpose by acting with one mind and giving their malchut to the Chayya (Anti-Mosiach) until will be fulfilled the divrei Hashem. [Yirmeyah 39:16]

18. "And the Isha whom you saw is the Ir Hagedolah that rules over the melachim (kings) of ha'aretz."

## Revelation 18

1. After these things I saw another malach coming down out of Shomayim having great samchut (authority; and ha'aretz was illuminated by the splendor of him. [Yechezkel 43:2]

2. And he cried in a kol gadol, saying,"Fallen, fallen is Bavel Hagedolah. It has become a habitation of shedim (demons) and a beit hasohar (prison) of every ruach temei'ah and beit hasohar (prison) of every (unclean) bird and a beit hasohar (prison) of every unclean beast. And has become detestable, [Yeshayah 13:21, 22; 34:11,13-15; Yirmeyah 50:39; 51:37; Zefanyah 2:14,15]

3. because of the yayin of the wrath of her zenut all the goyim (nations) have drunk, and the melachim (kings) of ha'aretz committed zenut, with her, and the merchants of ha'aretz by the resources of her luxury became rich." [Yechezkel 27:9-25]

4. And I heard another kol out of Shomayim saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you may not participate in the chatta'im of her, and some of her makkot (plagues) you may not receive", [Yeshayah 48:20; Yirmeyah 50:8; 51:6,9,45; Bereshis 19:15]

5. because her chata'im have piled up reaching up to Shomayim, and Hashem remembered the unrighteousnesses of her. [Divrey Hayamim Bais 28:9; Ezra 9:6; Yirmeyah 51:9]

6. Render to her as also she herself rendered; serve up a double  according to her ma'asim, in the kos (cup) which she mixed. [Tehillim 137:8; Yirmeyah 50:15,29; Yeshayah 40:2]

7. As she gave kavod to herself and lived in luxury, so give her an equal measure of torment and agmat nefesh, because in her lev (heart) she says, "I sit a malkah and not an almanach, and I will never see agmat nefesh." [Yechezkel 28:2-8; Tehillim 10:6; Yeshayah 47:7,8; Zefanyah 2:15]

8. Therefore in one day will come the makkot (plagues) on her, Mavet Agmat nefesh and Ra'av, with aish (fire) she will be burned up, because chazak is Hashem Adonoi, the one who became her Shofet. Yeshayah 9:14; 47:9; Yirmeyah 50:31,32]

9. And the melachim (kings) of ha'aretz, will weep and wail over  her, the ones having committed zenut with her and having lived in luxury, when they see the smoke of her burning. [Yirmeyah 51:8; Yechezkel 26:17,18]

10. They will stand afar off, because of the fear of her torment, saying "Oy, oy, the Ir Hagedolah, Bavel the strong city,  because in one hour came the mishpat of you."

11. And the merchants of ha'aretz cry and grieve over her, because the cargo of them no one buys any more [Yechezkel 27:27, 31]

12. cargo of gold and of silver and of precious stone and of pearls and of fine linen and of purple and of silk and of scarlet, and every kind of scented wood and every kind of ivory article and every kind of article of valuable wood and of bronze  and of iron and of marble [Yechezkel 27:12-22]

13. and cinnamon and spice and incense and myrrh and frankincense and yayin and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and kevasim, and of susim and of chariots and of slaves and nefashot (souls) of men. [Yechezkel 27:13]

14. And the p'ri for which your nefesh longed has departed from you, and all the luxurious things and the splendorous things   have become lost for you, and never again shall they be found!

15. And the merchants of these things, the ones having become rich from her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her  torment, and they will be weeping and wailing, [Yechezkel 27:31]

16. saying,"Oy, oy, the Ir Hagedolah, the one having clothed herself with fine linen and purple and scarlet and having been gilded with gold and precious stone and pearl,

17. "because in one hour such great wealth, was laid waste."  And there stood afar off every steersman and everyone sailing the sea and sailors and all who commerce on the sea. [Yechezkel 27:28-30]

18. And they were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, "What Ir (City) is like the Ir Hagedolah?" [Yechezkel 27:32]

19. And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and wailing, saying,"Oy, oy, the Ir Hagedolah, by which from her wealth, all the ones having ships in the sea became rich, because in one hour she was laid waste." [Yehoshua 7:6; Ekhah 2:10; Yechezkel 27:30,31]

20. Have lev same'ach over her, O Shomayim! you kedoshim and shluchim and nevi'im, for Hashem has given mishpat for you against her.  [Yirmeyah 51:48]

21. And a malach gibor lifted up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,"Thus will Bavel the Ir Hagedolah be violently thrown down, and never would it be found  anymore." [Yirmeyah 51:63]

22. And the sound of harpers those playing the nevel and of musicians and of flutists and of trumpeters will be heard in you no more and every umman of every craft will be found in you no more, and the sound of a mill, would be heard in you no more.  [Yeshayah 24:8; Yechezkel 26:13; Yirmeyah 25:10]

23. And the ohr of a menorah would shine in you no more, and the kol of a chason and of a kallah would be heard in you no more; because you merchants were the gedolim of ha'aretz, because by your kishufim were all the Goyim deceived, [Yirmeyah 7:34; 16:9; 25:10; Yeshayah 23:8; Nachum 3:4]

24. and in her were found the dahm of nevi'im (prophets) and of   kedoshim and of all the ones having been slain al Kiddush Hashem on ha'aretz. [Yirmeyah 51:49]

## Revelation 19

1. After these things I heard as it were a kol gadol of a great, multititude in Shomayim, saying, "Hallaluyah! The Yeshu'a and the Kavod and the Gevurah is of Eloheinu!

2. because emes and tzedek are the mishpatim of him because he judged the Zonas Hagedolah who was corrupting ha'aretz with the zenut of her and he took vengeance on her who has the dahm of the servants of Him on her hands."

3. And again they said, "Halleluia! The smoke of her ascends l'olemei olamim!" [Yeshayah 34:10]

4. And the esrim v'arba'ah Zekenim fell down and the Arbah chayyot and they worshiped Hashem who sits on the kisseh, saying,"Omein, Halleluia!"  ATKINU SEUDATA ("I SHALL ARRANGE THE MEAL") THE SE'UDAT MITZVAH L'SAMEACH REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE CHASON V'KALLAH, THE BRIT CHADASHA KEHILLAH, THE BRIT CHADASHA OF YIRMEYAH PEREK LAMMED ALEF BEING THEIR KETUBBA (MARRIAGE CONTRACT) AT THE CHASSUNA OF THE SEH; THE CHUPPAH IN SHOMAYIM, THE DIVINE CANOPY OVER MOSHIACH AND THE BRIT CHADASHA KEHILLAH

5. And a kol from the kisseh came forth saying, "Baruch Hashem Eloheinu all you avadim of him and the ones with yirat Shomayim, ketannim and the gedolim. [Tehillim 134:1; 115:13]

6. And I heard as it were a sound of a great multitude and a sound like mayim rabbim and a sound like mighty thunder saying,"Halleluyah! Because Hashem Eloheinu reigns, El Shaddai.

7. Let us have simcha and exult, and give kavod (glory) to Him because has come the Yom HaChupa, the Yom Nisu'im of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7), and his kallah has made herself ready.

8. And it was given to her that she should be clothed with fine linen, bright and tahor (clean); for, the fine linen are the Tzedakot of the kedoshim. [Yeshayah 61:10; Yechezkel 44:17; Zecharyah 3:4]

9. And he says to me, write: "ashrey are the ones having been summoned to the Yom Nisu'im seudah of the Seh. (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) And he says to me, "These are divrei Hashem Emes."

10. And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, "You must abstain from such. For I am a fellow eved with both you and your chaverim who hold on to the edut (testimony) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; worship Hashem! For the edut (testimony) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua is the Ruach of nevu'ah (prophecy)."
 THE RIDER ON THE SUS LAVAN (WHITE STALLION)

11. And I saw Shomayim having been opened, and --hinei!-- A lavan sus and the one riding on it is called  ne'eman and Yashar,  and in Tzedek [Daniel 9:25] he judges and makes milkhamah.  [Shemot 15:3; Tehillim 96:13; Yeshayah 11:4]

12. And, the Eynayim of him are as a flame of aish, and on the head of him are many atarot, and he has a name inscribed of which no one has da'as except himself.

13. And he is robed in a kaftan dipped in dahm, and his Name is called HADVAR HASHEM. [Yeshayah 63:2,3]

14. And the TZIVA'OT HaShomayim were following him on susim levanim. They were dressed in fine linen, lavan (white) and tahor (clean),

15. And out of the peh (mouth) of him goes forth a sharp cherev, that with it he may strike the goyim, and he will shepherd them with a shevet barzel, and he treads the press of the yayin of the fury of charon af of Hashem El Shaddai.[Yeshayah 11:4; Tehillim 2:9]

16. And he has on his garment and on his thigh a name inscribed: Melech Hamelechim and Adon HaAdonim.

17. And I saw one malach having taken his stand in the shemesh (sun) and he cried out in a kol gadol, saying to all the birds flying in mid-heaven, "Bo! Gather to the Seudah Hagedolah of Hashem; [Yirmeyah 12:9; 46:10; Yechezkel 39:17; Yeshayah 34:6]

18. that you may eat the basar of melachim (kings) and the basar of captains and the basar of strong men and the basar of susim and of their riders and the basar of all, both, bnei Chorim and avadim and the ketanim and the gedolim [Yechezkel 39:18-20]

19. And I saw the Chayyah [Anti-Moshiach] and the melachim (kings) of ha'aretz and their armies assembled to make milkhamah with the One sitting on the sus and with the tzeva'ot Hashem.

20. And the Chayyah [Anti-Moshiach] was captured and, with it, the navi sheker, the one having performed the otot before it, by which he deceived the ones having received the tav of the Chayyah [Anti-Moshiach] and the ones worshiping its Etzev. These two were cast alive into the Agam HaAish burning with gofrit (sulfur). [Daniel 7:11]

21. And the rest were killed with the cherev of the One sitting on the sus, the cherev having proceeded out of the PEH of him, and all the birds were fully fed by their basar.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw a malach coming down out of Shomayim having the mafte'ach (key) of the Tehom (Abyss) and a great chain in his hand,

2. and he seized the Dragon, the Nachash HaKadmoni, who is malshin [samekh mem, the devil] and Hasatan. And he bound him elef shanim,

3. and threw him into the Tehom (Abyss), and shut and sealed it over him that he could not deceive any more the goyim until haelef shanim were completed. After these things it is necessary for him to be released a short time. [Daniel 6:17]

4. And I saw kisa'ot and they sat on them and mishpat (judgment) was given to them, and I saw the nefashot (souls) of the ones having been beheaded because of their edut (testimony) for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and because of the dvar Hashem and for those who did not worship the Chayyah [Anti-Moshiach] nor its Etzev and did not receive the tav on the metsakh and on the their hand, and they awakened to Chayyim (Life) and reigned with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach elef shanim. [Daniel 7:9]

5. And the rest of the mesim did not awaken to Chayyim (Life) until haelef shanim should be completed. This is Techiyah HaRishonah.

6. Me'ushar and kadosh is the one having part in the Techiyah HaRishonah. On these ones the Mavet HaSheyni does not have shilton (authority, samchut), but they will be kohanim of Hashem Hashem and of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and will reign with him haelef shanim.  THE MAPPALAH (FALL, DEFEAT) OF HASATAN

7. And when haelef shanim would be completed, Hasatan will be released from his beit hasohar (prison),

8. and will go forth to deceive the goyim in the four corners of ha'aretz, that is, Gog and Magog, to assemble them for milkhamah. The mispar whose number is as the sand of seashore. [Yeshayah 11:12; Yechezkel 7:2; 38:2; 39:1; 38:9,15]

9. And they went up over the broad plain of the land and encircled the makhaneh (camp) of the kedoshim and the Ir HaAhuvah (the beloved city) and Aish came down out of Shomayim and consumed them. [Yechezkel 38:9,16; Tehillim 87:2; Yechezkel 38:22; 39:6]

10. And Hasatan, the one deceiving them, was thrown into the agam haAish (fire) and gofrit (sulfur), where both the Chayyah [Anti-Moshiach] and the navi sheker (false prophet) were, and they will be tormented yomam v'lailah l'Olemei Olamim.  THE MISHPAT AT THE KISSE LAVAN GADOL

11. And I saw a kisse lavan gadol (a great white throne) and the one sitting on it, from, whose presence ha'aretz and Shomayim fled, and no place was found for them.

12. And I saw the mesim, the ketanim and gedolim, having taken their stand before the kisse and sfarim were opened and another Sefer was opened, which is the Sefer HaChayyim and the mesim were judged by the things having been written in the sfarim according to their ma'asim (works). [Daniel 7:10; Shemot 32:32; Devarim 29:20; Daniel 12:1; Malachi 3:16; Yirmeyah 17:10]

13. And the Yam (Sea) gave up the mesim in it, and Mavet, and She'ol gave up haMesim in them, and they were judged, each one according to their ma'asim. [Yeshayah 26:19]

14. And Mavet and She'ol were thrown into the Agam HaAish. This is the Mavet HaSheyni, the Agam HaAish.

15. And if anyone was not found having been written in the Sefer HaChayyim, he was cast into the Agam HaAish.

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw Shomayim Chadashim and Eretz Chadasha for the Shomayim HaRishonah and HaAretz HaChadasha passed away, and there is no longer an Yam.

2. And I saw the Ir Hakodesh, the Yerushalayim HaChadasha coming down and descending out of Shomayim from Hashem, having been made ready as a Kallah adorned for her Ba'al. [Nechemyah 11:18; Yeshayah 52:1]

3. And I heard a kol gadol, a Bat Kol from the kisse saying, "hinei!--the mishkan of Hashem is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and He himself--Immanu-El--will be their G-d. [Shemot 25:8; Divrey Hayamim Bais 6:18; Yechezkel 48:35; Zecharyah 2:10]

4. And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and Mavet will be, nor agmat nefesh nor crying nor pain will be any longer; the former things have passed away." [Yeshayah 25:8; 35:10]

5. And said the One sitting on the kisseh, "hinei!--I make all things chadash." And he says, "Write, for these dvarim are ne'emanim and amittiyim."

6. And he said to me, "It is finished! I am the Alef and the Tav, the Reshit and the Ketz. To the one thirsting I will give of the Mayan (Fountain) of the mayim Chayyim (Life) freely. [Yeshayah 55:1]

7. The one who wins the nitzachon victory, shall inherit these things and I will be his G-d and he will be to me Beni.[Shmuel Bais 7:14]

8. But for those of morech lev (cowardliness) and those without emunah and ones having become vile and rotzkhim (murderers) and zonim (fornicators) and mekhashfim (sorcerers) and ovdei haelilim (idolaters) and all the shakranit (liars), their part will be in HaAgam burning with aish (fire) and gofrit (sulfur), which is HaMavet HaSheyni. [Tehillim 5:6]    THE YERUSHALAYIM HACHADASHA

9. And one of the shevat hamalachim having the sheva ke'arot (bowls) being full of the last sheva makkot (plagues), came and spoke with me, saying "Bo! I will show you the Kallah  of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7).

10. And he carried me away in Ruach Hakodesh onto a great and high mountain, and showed me Ir Hakodesh, Yerushalayim descending and coming down out of Shomayim from G-d Hashem, [Yechezkel 40:2]

11. having the kavod (glory) of Hashem, his Shekhinah was like a precious stone, even a jasper, clear as crystal, [Yeshayah 60:1,2; Yechezkel 43:2]

12. having a great and high wall, having Sheneym Asar shi'arim,  and at the shi'arim Sheneym Asar malachim, and Shemot (Names) were inscribed on them, which are the shemot of the Sheneym Asar shivtei habnei Yisroel (tribes of the sons of Israel). [Yechezkel 48:30-34]

13. There were shloshah shi'arim on the mizrach (east), there were shloshah shi'arim on the tzafon (north), and shloshah shi'arim on the darom (south) and shloshah shi'arim on the ma'arav (west).

14. And the wall of the Ir Hakodesh had Sheneym Asar Foundation Stones, and on them were the Sheneym Asar shemot (names) of the Sheneym Asar Shluchim of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7).

15. And the one speaking with me had a gold measuring rod, that he might measure the Ir Hakodesh and its shi'arim and its wall. [Yechezkel 40:3]

16. And the city is laid out foursquare, shaped like a cube, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the Ir Hakodesh with the rod across stadia Sheneym Asar thousand, the length and the breadth and the height are equal.

17. And he measured its wall a hundred forty-four cubits by man's measurement, which is also that of the malachim.

18. And the wall was constructed of jasper and the Ir was pure gold like clear glass.

19. The foundation stones of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of precious stone, Harishon (the first) foundation stone was jasper, Hasheni, sapphire, Hashlishi, chalcedony, Harevi'i, emerald; [Shemot 28:17-20; Yeshayah 54:11, 12; Yechezkel 28:13]

20. Hachamishi, sardonyx, Hashishi, carnelian, Hash'vi'i, chrysolite, Hashemini, beryl, Hateshi'i, topaz, Haasiri chrysoprase, HaAchad Asar, jacinth, Hasheneym Asar, amethyst.

21. And the Sheneym Asar shi'arim were Sheneym Asar pearls, respectively each one of the shi'arim was a single pearl. And the reckov (street) of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. [Yeshayah 54:12]

22. And I saw no Heikhal in it, for Adonoi Hashem El Shaddai and the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) are its Beis HaMikdash.

23. And the city has no need of the shemesh (sun) nor of the yare'ach (moon) that they may shine in it, for the kavod (glory) of Hashem illumined it and its menorah is the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7). [Yeshayah 24:23; 60:19]

24. And the Nations shall walk their derech by its Ohr (Light), and the melachim (kings) of ha'aretz shall bring their glory into it. [Yeshayah 60:3,5]

25. And the shi'arim of it shall never be shut b'yom for there will be no Lailah. [Yeshayah 60:11; Zecharyah 14:7]

26. And the melachim will bring the kavod (glory) of the Nations into it.

27. And never may enter into it any thing tameh and anyone practicing to'evah (abomination) and sheker (falsehood), but only the ones having been written in the Sefer HaChayyim (Life) of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7). [Yeshayah 52:1; Yoel 3:17]

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed me a nahar of water of Chayyim (Life) bright as crystal, going forth out of the kisseh of G-d Hashem and of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7), [Tehillim 36:8; 46:4; Yechezkel 47:1; Zecharyah 14:8]

2. In the middle of the rehkov (street) of it, and on either side on the nahar was the Aitz HaChayyim, producing Sheneym Asar Perot, according to each chodesh, yielding the p'ri of it, and the leaves of the Aitz (tree) are for the refu'ah of the Nations [Yechezkel 47:12]

3. And there shall no longer be any kelalah, and the kisseh of  Hashem and of the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7) shall be in it, and his avadim shall serve him. [Zecharyah 14:11]

4. And they will see his face, and ha-Shem of him will be on the mitzakhim (foreheads) of them.

5. And there shall no longer be Lailah, and they have no need of the ohr (light) of a menorah and the ohr (light) of the shemesh (sun), because Hashem Adonoi will give forth ohr (light) on them, and they will reign l'Olemei Olamim. [Yeshayah 60:19; Daniel 7:27]
 ANI MA'AMIN BE'EMUNAH SHLEIMAH B'BIAS HAMOSHIACH

6. And he said to me, "These dvarim are ne'emanim and amittiyim, and Hashem Elohei ruchot hanevi'im sent his malach to show to his avadim (slaves) things which are imminent.

7. And --hinei!--I am coming quickly. Ashrey is the one who is shomer, keeping the dvarim hanevu'ah of this sefer.

8. And I, Yochanan, am the one hearing and seeing these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell to worship before the feet of the malach showing me these things.

9. And he says to me, "See that you do not do it; a fellow eved of yours I am, and of your Achim, the nevi'im (prophets), and of the ones who are shomer, keeping the dvarim of this sefer;

10. Worship Hashem!" And he says to me, "Do not seal up the dvarim hanevu'ah (prophecy) of this sefer, for the time at hand. [Daniel 8:26]

11. Let the one being unrighteous, let him be unrighteous noch (still); and let the one who is filthy be filthy noch, and let the tzaddik be a tzaddik noch, [Daniel 9:25] and let the kadosh be yitkadesh noch. [Yechezkel 3:27; Daniel 12:10]

12. Hinei!--I am coming quickly, and my sachar (reward) is with me, to give to each one according to his ma'aseh. [Yeshayah 40:10; 62:11]

13. I am the Alef and the Tav, HaRishon (The First) and HaAcharon (The Last), HaReshit (The Beginning) and HaTachlit (The Ultimate).

14. Ashrey are the ones washing their kaftans, that they may have the right to the Aitz (tree) of Chayyim (Life) and they may enter by the shi'arim into the city.

15. Outside are the kelevim (dogs) and the mekhashfim and the zonim and the rotzkhim and the ovdei haelilim and everyone loving and practicing sheker. [Devarim 23:18]

16. I, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua sent my malach to give solemn edut (testimony) to you of these things, for the Kehillot. I am the shoresh and the offspring of Dovid, the Kokhav HaShachar.

17. And the Ruach Hakodesh and the Kallah say, "Bo!" And the one hearing let him say, "Bo!" And the one thirsting, let him come, the one desiring let him take the mayim haChayyim freely.

18. I give solemn edut to everyone hearing the divrei haNevu'ah of this sefer: if anyone adds to them Hashem will add to him the makkot (plagues) which are written in this sefer; [Devarim 4:2; 12:32; Mishle 30:6]

19. and if anyone takes away from the dvarim of the sefer of this nevu'ah (prophecy), Hashem will take away his share of the Aitz HaChayyim and from the Ir HaKodesh of the things having been described in this sefer. [Devarim 4:2; 12:32; Mishle 30:6]

20. He who gives solemn edut to these things says, "Ken! I am coming bahlt (soon)!" Omein. Come Adoneinu Yehoshua!

21. The Chen v'Chesed Hashem of the Adoneinu Yehoshua be with all.     Entire Brit Chadasha Translation finished 4/10/94 to 11/14/96 To Moshiach be the  Glory
