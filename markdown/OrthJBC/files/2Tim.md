# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Sha'ul, a shliach of Moshiach Yehoshua birtzon Hashem (by the will of G-d), according to the havtachah haChayim (promise of Life) in Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach Yehoshua.

2. To Timotiyos, beni haahuv (my beloved son).  Chesed Hashem, Rachamim Hashem and Shalom Hashem from Elohim Avinu and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu. LOYALTY TO THE BESURAS HAGEULAH

3. Modeh ani Hashem whom I offer avodas hakodesh with a matzpun tahor (as did the Avot of me), when I remember you constantly in my tefillos.

4.  As I remember your weeping, I want to see you, that I may be filled with simcha.

5. I remember your genuine emunah [in Moshiach], which dwelt first in Lois your savtah and in your em, Eunice, and I have been persuaded dwells also in you.

6.  For which cause I remind you to meorer (rekindle) the matnat Elohim, the gift of Hashem which is in you through my conferring of s'michah (ordination).

7. For Hashem did not bestow upon us a ruach of pachad (terror), but of gevurah (power) and of ahavah (love) and of sound havchanah (judgment).

8. Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the edut of Adoneinu nor of me, his asir (prisoner), but suffer together with me for the Besuras HaGeulah in the koach of Hashem,

9. the one having granted us Yeshu'at Eloheynu and having called us with a keri'ah kedosha (holy calling), not according to the ma'asim mitzvot of us but according to his own tachlis and chesed having been given to us in Moshiach Yehoshua before Yamim haOlam,

10. but having been manifested now through the appearing of Moshieynu Moshiach Yehoshua, who nullified death and also brought Chayyim and al-killayon (incorruptibility) to light through the Besuras HaGeulah,

11. for which I was appointed a karoz (herald), a maggid, a Shliach and a rabbi.

12. It is because of these things also that I suffer.  But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and I have been persuaded that he is able to stand shomer, guarding until haYom haHu the orthodox Jewish pikkadon (deposit) entrusted to him by me.

13. Follow the pattern of sound orthodox Jewish devarim which you heard from me, in emunah and ahavah in Moshiach Yehoshua.

14. Guard the orthodox Jewish pikkadon entrusted to you through the Ruach Hakodesh dwelling in us.

15. This you know: all the ones in Asia, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes, turned away from me.

16. May Hashem grant rachamim to the bais of Onesiphorus, because often he refreshed me and he was not ashamed of my kaval (fetter/chain).

17. But, when he was in Rome, he diligently sought me and found me.

18. May Adoneinu grant to him to find rachamim from Hashem in haYom haHu [1:12].  Also, in how many ways while in Ephesus he did avodas hakodesh you know very well.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. You, therefore, beni, be empowered in the Chen v'chesed which is in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua.

2. And what things you heard from me through edim rabbim (many witnesses), these things commit to anashim ne'emanim (faithful men) of zrizus (reliability) who will be qualified rabbinic morim to teach others also.

3. Take your place in suffering as a good chaiyal of Moshiach Yehoshua.

4. No one on duty as a chaiyal is entangled with the everyday chiloni (secular) affairs of inactive duty, in order that he may please the One who has enlisted him.

5. And no participant in an athletic tacharut (competition) is crowned unless he competes according to the rules.

6. It is the hard-working ikar (farmer) who ought to have the rishonah mipri ha'adamah (the first share from the harvest of the earth).

7. Let your devekut be a mediation on what I say, for Hashem will give to you binah (understanding) in all things.

8. Remember Yehoshua the Moshiach, of the zera Dovid, and remember Moshiach's Techiyas haMesim, according to my Besuras HaGeulah,

9. for which I suffer as if I were an evil-doer, even to the point of the bais hasohar's bonds, but the dvar Hashem has no bonds.

10.  Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the Bechirim (the Chosen ones), in order that they also may obtain the Yeshu'at HaEloheynu in Moshiach Yehoshua with kavod olamim.

11. Trustworthy is Hashem, for if we died (to the Olam Hazeh) with him, also we will live (in the Olam Habah) with him.

12. If we endure, also we will reign with him; if we will deny him, he also will deny us.

13. If we are not ne'emanim (faithful), he remains ne'eman (faithful), for to deny himself, he is not able. A PO'EL APPROVED IN MOSHIACH

14. Remind them of these things, solemnly warning them in the presence of Hashem not to be engaged in disputes over devarim, which is not beneficial, but only ruins the hearers.

15. Do your best to shtel zich (apply yourself), to present yourself to Hashem as one approved, a po'el (workman) unashamed, keeping on a straight derech the dvar haEmes.

16. But profane chatter bereft of kedusha, avoid, for such will advance fraie (irreligious) resha (evil).

17. Their lashon hora will spread like gangrene, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus,

18. who concerning haEmes missed the mark, teaching that the Techiyas haMesim has already occurred.  They are overthrowing the emunah of some.

19. Al kol panim (Nevertheless), the solid yesod of Hashem stands firm and zicher (certain), having this seal: V'YODA' Hashem ES ASHER LO ("Hashem KNOWS THE ONES WHO ARE HIS" BAMIDBAR 16:5); and let everyone who names the name of Hashem depart from 'avel (iniquity/gross injustice)

20. In a bais gadol, there are not only k'lei (vessels) of gold and silver but also those wooden ones and earthen ones; some, for honorable use, but others, for dishonorable use.

21. If anyone makes himself tahor from these things he will be a k'li (vessel) for honorable use, having been set aside as kadosh, useful to the Adon, ready for every ma'aseh tov.

22. But flee from ta'avot (lusts) of ne'urim (youth--Tehillim 25:7) and pursue tzedek, emunah, ahavah, and shalom with the ones calling on Adoneinu out of a lev tahor.

23. But speculations characterized by narrishkeit and lacking da'as--such refuse, knowing that they produce fights.

24. And an eved Hashem ought not be quarrel-prone, but ought to be gentle to all, a skilled rabbinic moreh, savlan (patient),

25. correcting the mitnaggedim in meekness, in the tikvah that Hashem may efsher (perhaps) grant them teshuva, resulting in da'as haEmes,

26. and that they may come to their senses, escaping the mashchit (trap) of Hasatan, after having been captured by him to do his will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But this know, that in the acharit hayamim there will be hard times,

2. for bnei Adam will be in love with self, ohavei kesef (lovers of money), ga'avtanim (proud boasters), speakers of lashon hora, disobedient to horim (parents), without hargasha todah (gratitude), without kedusha,

3. without ahavah, unforgiving and irreconcilable, without being kovesh es yitzro (self-controlled), bestial, son'ei haTov (haters of the Good),

4. treacherous, reckless, conceited, ohavei ta'anugot (lovers of pleasures) rather than ohavei Hashem,

5. having an outward form of yirat Shamayim but the ko'ach of chassidus having denied.  Turn away from these.

6. For of such are the morim entering into homes and capturing  weak-willed nashim laden with chata'im, led away by various ta'avot,

7. always learning but never being able to come to da'as haEmes.

8. As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moshe Rabbeinu, so also these oppose haEmes.  These men have been corrupted in their mind and are failures with respect to the emunah [of Moshiach],

9. but they will not proceed very far, for the sichlut (folly) of them will likewise become conspicuous to all.  THE RABBI'S LAST CHARGE TO HIS TRUSTED TALMID

10. But you closely followed my torah, my halicha, my megamma (course of life, shteiger), emunah, my long-suffering, ahavah, and endurance,

11. the redifot (persecutions) and sufferings which happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, what kind of persecutions I endured.  And out of all Adoneinu rescued me.

12. Also all the ones wanting to live as chasidim in Moshiach Yehoshua will be persecuted,

13. but anashim ra'im and impostors will progress to their abysmal worst, misleading and being misled. GIRSA D'YANKUTO (LEARNING ACQUIRED IN CHILDHOOD)

14. But, you, remain in the shiurim you took and the things you were convinced of, knowing under which rabbi you sat,

15. and that from infancy you have known the Kitvei haKodesh, which are able to make you chocham with a view to Yeshu'at Eloheynu through emunah in Moshiach Yehoshua.

16. The entire Kitvei haKodesh is Hashem-breathed and useful for hora'ah, for reproof, for correction, for training in tzedek,

17. that the ish haElohim may be proficient, having been equipped for every one of the ma'asim mitzvot.

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I solemnly charge you before Hashem and Moshiach Yehoshua, the imminent Shofet of the living and dead and by Bias Moshiach and his Malchut:

2. Preach the dvar Hashem, be ready in season out of season, expose, rebuke, encourage, with all long suffering and hora'ah.

3. For there will be a time when sound charedi (orthodox) hora'ah they will not bear, but according to their ta'avot they will accumulate morim to tickle their ears.

4. And from haEmes of Hashem they will turn away their ear and to aggadah they will be turned aside.

5. But, you, be kovesh es yitzro (self-controlled) in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of a maggid of the Besuras HaGeulah, fully carry out your avodas hakodesh.

6. For I already am being poured out, and the time of my departure has come.

7. The milchemet tzedek I have fought, the course I have finished, the emunah I have been shomer mitzvot.

8. Henceforth, there is laid up for me the keter hatzedakah (crown of righteousness) which Adoneinu, the Shofet Tzedek, will give to me in haYom haHu, and not only to me, but also to all the ones who are ohavei Bias Moshiach.

9. Be diligent to come to me quickly.  FINAL MITZVOS TIMOTIYOS WILL EFFECT FOR REBBI MELECH HAMOSHIACH

10. For Demas forsook me.  Having loved the Olam Hazeh, he departed for Thessalonica; Crescens, to Galatia; Titos to Dalmatia.

11. Lukas alone is with me.  Get Markos and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for avodas hakodesh.

12. Now Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.

13. When you come, bring the cloak which I left behind in Troas with Carpus, and the megillos, especially the parchments.
 WATCH OUT FOR THAT MAZIK ALEXANDER

14. Alexander the coppersmith did much rish'ah to me; Adonoi will repay him L'ISH K'MA'ASEIHU ("TO EACH AS HIS DEEDS"--TEHILLIM 62:13).

15. You also watch out for him, because he greatly opposed our message about Moshiach.

16. At my first defense, no one came to be with me, but all forsook me. May it not be counted against them.

17. But Adoneinu stood with me, and empowered me, that through me the hachrazah (proclamation, kyrygma) of the Besuras HaGeulah might be fully preached and all the Goyim might hear it. And I was rescued out of the mouth of the lion.

18. Hashem will rescue me from every evil work and thus will bring me safely into his Malchut haShomayim.  Lo haKavod l'olam va'ed.  Omein.  A FINAL SHALOM

19. Greet Prisca and Aquila and the bais of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus, ailing, I left behind in Miletus.

21. Make haste to come before winter.  Eubulus and Pudens and Linus greet you, Claudia and all the achim in Moshiach.

22. Hashem be with your neshamah. Chesed Hashem be with you.
