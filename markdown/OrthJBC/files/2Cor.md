# 2 Corinthians

## 2 Corinthians 1

1.  From Sha'ul, a shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua through the birtson Hashem, and Timotiyos, the Ach b'Moshiach; To the Kehillah (congregation) of Hashem existing in Corinth, with all the kedoshim existing throughout Achaia [Greece].

2. Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and shalom from Elohim Avinu and Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. MODEH ANI AFTER REDIFAH;  SHA'UL, NOW WITH PERSONAL DA'AS OF THE REASON WHY HE WAS PREVIOUSLY FORBIDDEN TO ENTER ASIA (MODERN TURKEY), SPECIFICALLY EPHESUS (ACTS 16:6), SINCE TERRIBLE PERIL AND A HORRIBLE EISEK (ORDEAL) AWAITED HIM THERE, AND NOW, A FEW YEARS LATER, HAVING EXPERIENCED THE PERSECUTION THE RUACH HAKODESH HAD BEEN PROTECTING HIM FROM (ACTS 16:6), SHA'UL IS NOW FILLED WITH NECHAMAH AND SIMCHA  AFTER BEING DELIVERED FROM A BRUSH WITH DEATH IN EPHESUS

3. Baruch hu Hashem Elohim Avi Adoneinu Yehoshua, Avi haRachamim vaElohei kol nechamah (comfort), [Tehillim 103:13; Yeshayah 66:13]

4. the one giving us chizzuk with respect to all our tzoros so as to enable us to give chizzuk to the ones experiencing tzoros, and that through the nechamah (comfort) by which we ourselves are comforted (1:3) by Hashem. [Yeshayah 49:13; 51:12; 66:13]

5. This is so because as the Chevlei Moshiach (birth pangs of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach) abound to us, so through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach abounds also our nechamah (1:3; Yeshayah 51:12).  [TEHILLIM 34:19; 94:19]

6. Now if we are experiencing tzoros, it is for your chizzuk and Yeshu'at Eloheinu; or if we are being given nechamah (comfort), it is for your nechamah that is producing in you the chozek (strength) of zitzfleisch (patience) for the endurance of the tzoros which we also suffer. [I Thes. 3:3] 
 A TIKVAH BASED ON YICHUDIM (UNIFICATIONS), ONE WITH THE CHEVLEI REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, ONE WITH THE NECHAMAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

7. And our tikvah (hope) for you is well-founded, for we have da'as that as you are chaverim with devekut Hashem (cleaving to) the Chevlei Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, so also you will be chaverim with devekut Hashem (cleaving to) the nechamah (comfort).
 THE NEAR KIDDUSH HA-SHEM OF THE CHIEF SHLIACH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TO THE GOYIM AND THE DELIVERANCE THAT PREVENTED SHA'UL'S MARTYRDOM IN EPHESUS, ALL PART OF THE SAME DIVINE PLAN SHOWN IN ACTS 16:6, WHERE THE SHLUCHIM ARE KEPT OUT OF EPHESUS BYA DVAR OF CHOCHMAH AND DIVINE GUIDANCE, AND NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO FACE THE DANGERS OF EPHESUS UNTIL THE KEHILLOT IN GREECE ARE ESTABLISHED

8. For we do not want you to lack da'as, Achim, b'Moshiach, as to the tzoros and tribulation that came upon us in Asia [Act 19:23; I Cor. 15:32], that utterly beyond our strength we were burdened, causing us to come to a feeling of yiyush (despair) even of being able to stay alive.

9. But we ourselves have had the gezar din (verdict) of mavet (Death) in ourselves that we should not have emunah in ourselves but in Hashem, the One of whom [we say] Mechayyei Mesim Atah (Thou Revivest the Dead). [Yirmeyah 17:5,7]

10. The same G-d out of so great a Mavet delivered us and will continue to deliver us.  We have set tikvateinu that He will yet deliver us, [II Tim. 4:18]

11. as you also labor together for us by techinnah (supplication), so that the "Modeh Ani" for us will be said by the many (Yeshayah 53:11-12) for the matanah (gift) granted us through the tefillos of the many. [Yeshayah 53:11-12] THE HACHUNNOS (PLANS) OF THE SHLIACH AND, AFTER THEM, THE PLAN OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH; DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST THE ACCUSATION OF REMIYAH OR EVEN VACILLATION IN HIS PLANS;

12. For our glorying is in this: the edut (testimony) of our matzpun (conscience) [Heb. 13:18] is that without remiyah (guile, deceit) and with the lev tahor ("pure heart)," [TEHILLIM 51:12] of Hashem [II Cor. 2:17] and not in the "chochmah" of the basar [ICor 1:17] but in the Chen v'Chesed of Hashem, we conducted ourselves in the Olam Hazeh, and more especially toward you.

13. For we write nothing so shver (complex) to you that you cannot read and have binah, and I have tikvah that you will have da'as shlemah until HaKetz--

14. as you have already had da'as of us in part--as also we are your kavod [II Cor. 5:12], even as also you are ours in the Yom Hashem of Adoneinu Yehoshua. [Php 2:16]

15. And with this bittachon I planned previously to come to you, that a second benefit you might have.

16. It was my chesbon (plan) to visit you by way of Macedonia and again from Macedonia to come to you, and, by you, to be sent on to Yehudah (Judea--Act 19:21; I Cor 16:5,6).

17. This was my mattarah (aim, goal); surely then I did not act with vacillation?  Or when I make plans [II Cor 5:16], do I have a cheshbon (plan) according to the basar, ready with "Ken, Ken!" and then, "Lo! Lo!"

18. Al emunat Hashem, our dvar to you has not been "Ken" and "Lo."

19. For the Ben haElohim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, the One having been proclaimed among you by us, Sila and Timotiyos and I [Act 18:5], was not "Ken and Lo"; but in Him it is always "Ken."

20. For in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach every one of Hashem's havtachot (promises) is "Ken."  For this reason is it in b'Shem Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach that we say the "Omein" to the kavod of Elohim [I Cor. 14:16; Rev. 3:14].

21. But it is Hashem who establishes us with you in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and has given us the mishchah (anointing--I Joh. 2:27),

22. having put his chatam [seal of ownership--Bereshis 38:18; Yechezkel 9:4; Eph 1:13; 4:30; Rev 7:4] on us and having given the eravon (pledge) of the Ruach Hakodesh in our levavot (hearts--Rom 8:16; II Cor. 5:5; Eph. 1:14). [Bereshis 38:18; Yechezkel 9:4; Chaggai 2:23] THE CONSTANT TOCHNIT HASHEM (PURPOSEFUL AND WILLED PLAN OR GOAL) OF HASHEM AFTER THE CHANGING PLANS OF THE SHLIACH [MISHLE 16:3,4,9]

23. Now, I call upon Hashem as eidus (witness) to my nefesh, my   neshamah (soul), that it was to spare you, that I did not come again to Corinth. [Rom 1:9; II Cor. 11:31; Php 1:8; I Thes. 2:5,10]

24. Not that we play the macher over your emunah (faith) [I Pet 5:3], but we are fellow po'alim for your simchah, for by emunah (faith) you stand.

## 2 Corinthians 2

1. For I decided this in myself, not again to come to you in agmat nemesh. [I Cor. 4:21; II Cor. 12:21]

2. For if I grieve you, then who is the one cheering me except the one I have caused to have agmat nefesh?

3. And I wrote the iggeret as I did, so that when I came, I should not have agmat nefesh from those who should have brought me simchah; for I have bittachon about you all, that my simchah is that of all of you.

4. For out of much tzoros and distress of lev (heart) I wrote the iggeret to you with many tears [Acts 20:31], not that you should have agamat nefesh, but that you may have da'as of the ahavah in Hashem which I have more abundantly for all of you. SELICHAH FOR THE OFFENDER

5. Now if anyone has caused agmat nefesh, it is not me he has grieved, but -- to some extent, not to be to severe -- he has grieved you all. [I Cor 5:1]

6. Sufficient to such a man was this onesh (penalty) by the roiv (majority),

7. so that, on the contrary, rather you ought to give selichah and chizzuk to him lest efsher (perhaps) with more abundant agamat nefesh such a one may be swallowed up.

8. Therefore I urge you to confirm to him your ahavah (love).

9. I wrote the iggeret to this end, that I may have da'as that you are tested and proven, that in all things you have mishma'at   (obedience).  [II Cor. 7:15; 10:6]

10. Now to anyone you give selichah of anything, I do as well, for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the presence of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach;

11. lest we should be outsmarted by HaSatan [Luk 22:31]; for we do not lack da'as of his kesharim.

12. But having come to Troas for the Besuras Hageulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and a delet (door) to me having been opened by the Adoneinu, [Yechezkel 20:14; Acts 14:27; I Cor.16:9; Col.4:3; Rev. 3:8]

13. I did not have shalom in my neshamah when I was not able to find Titos my ach b'Moshiach. So I took leave of them and I went on to Macedonia. [Acts 20:1]


 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S PROGRAM OF KIRUV RECHOKIM (BRINGING NEAR THE FAR WAY ONES) AND HASHEM WHO STANDS BEHIND IT

14. But Baruch Hashem, the One in whom didan notzakh (we are victorious) who always leads us in triumph in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and through us, in every place spreads the fragrance of the da'as of him.

15. For we are the aroma of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to Hashem among the ones coming to yeshu'at Eloheinu and among the ones perishing; [I Cor. 1:18; Dan. 12:2]

16. to the latter ones a fragrance of mavet unto mavet; but to the former ones a fragrance of Chayyim (life) unto Chayyim [Luk 2:34]. Who is sufficient for these things,[II Cor 3:5-6]

17. For we are not as many, peddling the dvar Hashem, but as from sincerity, as from Hashem, in the presence of Hashem, in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach we speak. [II Cor. 1:12; I Pet. 4:11]

## 2 Corinthians 3

1. Do we begin again to commend ourselves? [II Cor. 5:12] Or surely we do not need, as some do, commendatory iggrot to you or from you? [Acts 18:27; Rom 16:1]

2. You are our iggeret, written on our levavot, being known and being read by kol beni Adam. [I Cor. 9:2]

3. And you show that you are an iggeret from Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, prepared by us, having been written not with ink but with the Ruach Hakodesh of the Elohim Chayyim, not on luchot of stone [Shemot 24:12; 31:18; 32:15,16; 34:1; Devarim 9:10,11] but  on luchot of lev basar. [Mishle 3:3; 7:3; Yirmeyah 31:33; Yechezkel 11:19; 36:26]
 THE BRIT CHADASHA AND ITS AVODAS KODESH; WHEN MOSHE RABBEINU WENT IN BEFORE THE L-RD, MOSHE TOOK THE VEIL OFF; IN THE SAME WAY, WHOEVER TURNS TO THE L-RD, HAS THE VEIL TAKEN AWAY

4. Such is the bittachon that we have through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach toward Hashem.

5. Not that we are competent from ourselves to claim anything as of ourselves, but our competence is from Hashem, [II Cor 2:16]

6. who also made us competent as klei kodesh mesharetim  (ministers) of a Brit Chadasha [Shemot 24:8; Yirmeyah 31:31; 32:40; I Cor 11:25; Heb 8:8-13] not of chumra (not of strict adherence to the letter of the law, legalism), but of the Ruach Hakodesh: for the chumra (letter of the law) kills, but the Ruach Hakodesh gives Chayyim (life). [Joh. 6:63; Rom 7:6].

7. Now if the sherut of mavet chiseled in letters engraved on luchot of stone came with kavod (glory), so that the Bnei Yisroel were not able to gaze into the face of Moshe Rabbeinu because of  P'NI MOSHE KI KARON  ("face of Moshe Rabbeinu that he was radiant" SHEMOT 34:35) because of the kavod (glory) of his face,  the kavod (glory) which is fading, [Shemot 34:29-34; Yeshayah 42:21]

8. then how much more will the avodas kodesh ministry of the Ruach Hakodesh come in kavod (glory)?

9. For if there was kavod in the sherut of haresha'ah (condemnation) [Devarim 27:26] how much more abounds in kavod the sherut of Tzedek. [DANIEL 9:25; Rom. 1:17;3:21]

10. For indeed what once had kavod has lost its kavod [Shemot 34:29-30]  on account of the surpassing kavod (glory).

11. For if the thing, which now is fading away, came with kavod (glory), much more has that which remains come in kavod.

12. Since, then, we have such a tikvah (hope), we act with much oz.

13. And we are not as Moshe Rabbeinu, who was putting HAMMASVEH AL PANAV ("the veil over his face" SHEMOT 34:33,35) to keep the bnei Yisroel from gazing at the end of the thing fading away.

14. But their minds were hardened; [Rom. 11:25] for until the present day the same veil remains at the keri'atha Torah (the reading of Torah in shul), not being unveiled, because the veil is being abolished in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

15. For until today, whenever Moshe Rabbeinu is being read, a veil lies on their levavot.

16. But whenever one turns to Adoneinu HAMMASVEH is taken away. [Shemot 34:34; Yeshayah 25:7; Rom. 11:23-26]

17. Now Adoneinu is Ha Ruach and where Ha Ruach Adoneinu is, there is cherut (freedom). [Yeshayah 61:1,2; Joh 7:39; 8:32,36; Rom 8:2; Gal. 5:1,13]

18. Now all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the kavod of Adoneinu [Shemot 16:7; 24:17] reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same demut from kavod (glory) to kavod, even as from Adoneinu, Ha Ruach.     




 THE AVODAS KODESH AND ITS FREELY GIVEN TREASURE IN EARTHEN VESSELS

## 2 Corinthians 4

1. Therefore, since it is by the chesed of Hashem that we have this sherut, this kehunnah, [II Cor 3:16] we do not lose chozek. [Tehillim 18:45; Yeshayah 40:31]

2. But we renounced the things nistar (hidden) of bushah, not going about with cunning nor falsifying the dvar Hashem. Rather by the manifestation of HaEmes we present ourselves to every man's matzpun in the sight of Hashem. [II Cor 2:17; I Thes.2:5]

3. But if indeed our Besuras haGeulah is nistar, it is nistar  among the ones perishing , [I Cor 1:18]

4. in whose case the g-d of the Olam Hazeh (Eph.2:2) blinded the  minds of the ones without emunah, so the illumination of the Besuras HaGeulah of the kavod of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, who is the demut of Hashem, [Col.1:15;Heb.1:3] would not shine on them.

5. For we preach not ourselves but Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  Adoneinu Yehoshua and ourselves as your avadim (servants) for Yehoshua's sake. [II Cor.1:24]

6. Because Hashem is the one who said,"Let Ohr shine out of choshech [Bereshis 1:3; Yeshayah 9:2] who shone in our levavot for an illumination of the da'as of the kavod of Hashem in the face of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. [II Cor. 3:18]

7. Now we have this otzar (treasure) in earthen vessels [II Cor 5:1] that the excellence of the ko'ach may be of Hashem and not of us; [Iyov 4:19; Yeshayah 64:8; Shofetim 7:2]

8. Being oppressed on every side  [II Cor. 1:8; 7;5] but not being crushed, being perplexed but not in yi'ush (despair, atzvut),

9. being persecuted but not forsaken, being cast down but not  destroyed, [Tehillim 37:24; Mishle 24:16]

10. always bearing about the dying of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in my guf (body) that also the Chayyim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in the guf (body) of us might be manifested. [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

11. For always we, the ones living, are being given over to mavet because of Moshiach [Rom 8:36; I Cor. 15:31] that also the Chayyim of Moshiach may be manifested in our mortal basar.

12. So then death works in us but Chayyim in you.

13. And having the same Ruach Hakodesh of emunah (faith) that is accordance with the kitvei Hakodesh, HE'EMANITI KIADABER ("I believed, therefore I speak "TEHILLIM 116:10), we both believed and therefore we speak,

14. having da'as that the one having raised Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua us also with Yehoshua will raise and will present us with you. [Rom. 8:11; I Cor. 6:14; 15:15,20]

15. For all things are because of you [II Cor. 1:3-6] that the Chen v'Chesed Hashem, having increased through the many, may increase the hodayah (thanksgiving) to the kavod of Hashem. [1:6]


 LIVING BY EMUNAH (4:16) BECAUSE WHAT IS VISIBLE IS FOR THE YOM HACHURBAN BUT WHAT IS INVISIBLE IS FOR L'OLAMIM

16. Therefore we do not lose chozek. For, indeed, even if our outward man is becoming old and atrophied, yet our inward man is yom yom being renewed. [Eph. 3:16] [Tehillim 18:45; 103:5; Yeshayah 40:31]

17. For our present momentary tzoros is preparing us for an eternal weight of kavod (glory) utterly beyond measure, [Tehillim 30:5; Rom. 8:17-18]

18. for while we are not looking at the visible things but the invisible; [Col. 1:16; Heb. 11:1,3] for the things visible are zemanniyim (temporary) but the things invisible are for L'olamim.

## 2 Corinthians 5

1. For we have da'as that if our beit mishkaneinu [Iyov 4:19; II Cor.4:7] is made churban, we have a bais from Hashem, a bais not made with hands, in Shomayim L'olamim. [Yeshayah 38:12]

2. For indeed in this mishkaneinu we groan, longing for the train of our robe to be our sukkah from shomayim. [Rom. 8:23]

3. -- if indeed thus clothed we will not be found naked.

4. For while we are still in this Mishkan, we groan under our burden, in as much as we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, that the mortal may be swallowed up by chayyim.  [I Cor. 15:53-54]

5. Now the one having prepared us for this very thing is Hashem, the One having given us the eravon (pledge) of the Ruach Hakodesh. [Rom 8:16,23; II Cor 1:22; Eph 1:13]

6. Therefore we always have bittachon, since we have da'as that being at home in the guf (body), we are away from home in Adoneinu. [Heb. 11:13-16]

7. For we walk by emunah (faith), not by sight; [I Cor. 13:12]

8. therefore we have bittachon and are pleased rather to leave home from the guf (body) and to be at home with Adoneinu. [Php 1:23]

9. Therefore, also we are aspiring, whether at home or away from home to be well pleasing to Hashem, [Col. 1:10; I Thes 4:1]

10. since it is necessary for all of us to be revealed for an appearance before the Kisse Din of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (Judgment throne of Moshiach), so that each one of us may be recompensed for the things done through the basar, according to his ma'asim (works), whether tov or rah. [Kohelet 12:14; Acts 17:31; Rom. 2:16;14:10]
 THE BRIT CHADASHA AND THE NOSEI K'LEI HASHEM (ONES CARRYING THE VESSELS OF HASHEM), THE SHERUT OF HITRATZTZUT (RECONCILIATION)

11. Therefore, since we have da'as of the yirat [Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach] Adoneinu, we persuade men, and we have been made manifest to Hashem and I have tikvah (hope) also that we have been made manifest to your (consiences) matzpunim. [Iyov 23:15; II Cor.4:2]

12. We are not commending ourselves to you again [II Cor 3:1],  but are giving an opportunity to you of glorying on behalf of us [II Cor.1:14] that you may respond to those who glory in appearance and not in lev.

13. For if we seem meshuga, it is for Hashem; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.

14. For the ahavah (love) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach controls us, because we have judged this, that one [Moshiach] died on behalf of all and therefore all died.

15. And Moshiach died, on behalf of all, [I Tim 2:6] that the ones living may live no longer to themselves but to the one [Moshiach] who died on behalf of them has been made to stand up alive in his techiyas hamesim.  [Rom 14:7-8]

16. From now on, therefore, we have da'as of no one from a purely human point of view; if indeed we have had da'as of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach according to the basar we now no longer so have da'as of him,

17. so that if anyone is in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, he is a bria chadasha (a new being) [Rom 8:1,10; Gal. 6:15]:  the old things passed away; hinei, all has become chadash. [Yeshayah 43:18; 65:17; Rev. 21:5]

18. And all things are of Hashem, who is the one having granted to us ritztzuy (reconciliation) to himself through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [Rom 5:10] and has given to us the sherut haRitztzuy (the ministry of reconciliation),

19. davka (specifically), that Hashem was in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reconciling the Olam to himself, [Rom. 3:24-25; Col 1:19-20) not reckoning their avonot against them and putting in us (the message of reconciliation) Dvar HaRitztzuy.

20. On behalf of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, therefore, we are emissaries of shalom [Yeshayah 27:5; 52:7; Eph. 6:20], as if Hashem were entreating through us: we ask on behalf of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, be reconciled to Hashem.

21. The one who in his person was without da'as of chet (transgression) [Act 3:14; Jo. 8:46; Heb. 4:15; 7:26; I Pet. 2:22; I Jo. 3:5], this one Hashem made a sin offering, chattat kapparah [Gal. 3:13; Yeshayah 53:10] on our behalf that we might become the Tzedek [DANIEL 9:25] of Hashem in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  [I Cor 1:30; Php. 3:9]

## 2 Corinthians 6

1. As we work together with him, we also urge you not to recieve the Chen v'Chesed Hashem in vain. [II Cor 5:20]

2. For he says B'ET RATZON ANITICHA UV'YOM Y'SHUAH AZARTICHAH ("In a time acceptable I heard you and in a day of salvation I helped you" [YESHAYAH 49:8]. Hinei, now is the acceptable time;  now is Yom Yeshu'ah. Tehillim 69:13; Yeshayah 55:6 Luk 4:19-21]

3. not giving in anything a cause for michshol, lest the Messianic Avodas Kodesh (holy worship, service) be blamed;

4. but in everything presenting ourselves [II Cor 4:2] as mesharetim of Hashem -- in much savlanut, in tzoros, in hardships, in distresses,

5. in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in tzomot, [II Cor. 11:23-27]

6. in purity, in da'as, in long-suffering, in chesed, in the Ruach Hakodesh, in ahavah amittit, [I Tim 4:12]

7. in the dvar HaEmes, in the gevurat Hashem, [I Cor 2:4] through the weapons of Tzedek [DANIEL 9:25] of the right hand and of the left.

8. Through honor and dishonor, through ill repute and good repute; as "deceivers" and yet true,

9. as being unknown and yet being well known, as dying and hinei, we live! [II Cor 4:10]...As given the death penalty and yet not penalized wiht death [Tehillim 118:18]

10. as having agmat nefesh but always having simcha [II Cor 7:4; Php 2:17; Col 1:24; I Thes 1:6] as poor but enriching many, as having nothing and yet possessing everything.

11. We have spoken freely with you Corinthians, our levavot has been enlarged.

12. There is no penury in our affections, only in yours.

13. Now--I speak as to yeladim--make a fair exchange and open wide your levavot [I Cor 4:14].  THE BEIS HAMIKDASH OF HASHEM (THE KEHILLAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH) REQUIRES A RESPONSE OF TOTAL CONSECRATION

14. Do not become unequally yoked with koferim (unbelievers) [Eph 5:7,11] for what shuttafut has Tzedek [DANIEL 9:25] with lawlessness?  Or where is the Brit (Covenant) between ohr (light) and chosech (darkness)? [Bereshis 24:3; Devarim 22:10]

15. And what harmony does Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach have with B'liya'al? Or what chelek (allotment, inheritance) has a ma'amin with a kofer?

16. And what agreement has the heikhal of Hashem with elilim?  For we are a heikhal of the Elohim Chayyima [I Cor. 3:16; 6:19] as Hashem, "V'HITHALECHTI B'TOCHCHEM ("And I will walk in the midst of you" [VAYIKRA 26:12] I WILL BE MISHKANI ALEHEM ("dwelling place of me with them" [YECHEZKEL 37:27]) V'HAYU LI L'AM VAANIEHEYEH LAHEM LELOHIM [YIRMEYAH 32:38] ("And they will be to me as people and I will be to them as G-d." [YIRMEYAH 32:38] ON AVOIDANCE OF HUKKAT HAGOYYIM (IMITATION OF GENTILE CUSTOMS)

17. Therefore SURU come out from the midst of them and be separated says Adoneinu and an TAMEH AL TIGAU "unclean thing do not touch;" [YESHAYAH 52:11] ERTZEH ETCHEM "and I will receive you" [YECHEZKEL 20:34,41; Rev.18:4]

18. and I will be to you an AV and you will be to me BANIM and BANOT ("my daughters" [SHEMUEL BAIS 7:8,14; YESHAYAH 43:6; YIRMEYAH 31:9] says Adonoi Tzva'ot. [Shemot 4:22; Divrey Hayamim Alef 17:13; AMOS 3:13 LXX 4:13 LXX Rev 4:8; 11:17; 15:3; 21:22]

## 2 Corinthians 7

1. Therefore, having these havtachot (promises), Chaverim, let us submit to his taharah, cleansing ourselves from every defilement of basar and ruach, perfecting kedushah (holiness) in yirat Shomayim.  TESHUVA OPENS THE DELET TO CHAYYIM

2. In your levavot make a cheder for us; we wronged no one, we ruined no one, we exploited no one.  [II Cor 12:17]

3. I do not say this to bring you under haresha'ah, for I have said before that you are in our levavot [II Cor. 6:11-12; Php 1:7] whether to die with you or to live with you. [Shmuel Beis 15:21]

4.  I have much ometz lev toward you, I glory much on your behalf; I have been filled with chozek, I am filled to overflowing with simcha at all of our tzoros.

5. For indeed when we had come into Macedonia [Act 20:1-2; II Cor. 2:13] we had no physical mano'ach but we had tzoros everywhere: battles on the outside, fears inside. [Devarim 32:25]

6. But Hashem who encouraging the lowly, encouraged us [Yeshayah 49:13; II Cor. 1:3-4] by the coming of Titos,

7. and not only by the coming of him, but also by the encouragement by which he was encouraged over you, reporting to us your longing, your mourning, your kanous (zeal) for me, so that it caused me to have even more simcha.

8. Because if indeed I caused you agmat nefesh by the iggeret, I do not regret it; though I did regret it, but I see that that iggeret grieved you only briefly; [II Cor 2:4]

9. Now I have simcha, not that you had agmat nefesh, but that your grief brough you to teshuva, for your agmat nefesh was in Hashem, so that by us you suffered in nothing.

10. For the agmat nefesh that is according to Hashem produces teshuva to Yeshu'at Eloheinu, not to be regretted, but the agmat nefesh of the Olam Hazeh produces mavet. [Mat. 27:3-5; Heb 12:17]

11. For, hinei, see what zerizut (diligence) this agmat nefesh of Hashem has produced in you, what defense, what indignation,  what yirat Shomayim, what longing, what kanous, what onesh!  At every point you proved yourselves to be without ashma (guilt) in the matter.

12. Then though I wrote an iggeret to you, it was not for the sake of the one having done resha, nor for the sake of the one who was beleidikt (offended), but for the sake of your kanous for us becoming manifest to you before Hashem.

13. In this we have chozek.  But in addititon to our encouragement, we had still more simcha at the simcha of Titos, because his neshamah has been set at rest by all of you;

14. Because if I have been somewhat boastful about you Corinthians to Titos, I was in this not put to shame, but just as everything we said to you is HaEmes, so also our boasting to Titos has proven true as well.

15. And his lev (heart) goes out to you, all the more as he has zikaron of the mishma'at (obedience) of all of you [II Cor 2:9] as you received him with B'YIRAH (fear) and BIRA'DAH (trembling) [Tefillah 2:11]

16. I have simcha that in everything I have bittachon in you.

## 2 Corinthians 8

1. Now we make known to you, Achim b'Moshiach, the Chen v'Chesed Hashem that was granted to Moshiach's Kehillot of Macedonia,

2. that during a great ordeal of tzoros, their abundant simcha and the extreme depth their aniyyut (poverty) abounded to the osher (riches) of their generosity; [Shemot 36:5; Phil.1:29-30; I Thes.1:6; 2:14; 3:3-4]

3. that according to their ability, I give solemn edut, and ad kdei kach (that much!) even beyond their ability, they gave voluntarily and of their own accord,

4. begging us, requesting from us the privilege of participating in giving tzedakah to the Messianic Jewish ministry of the kedoshim [Rom 15:26; Acts 11:29; II Cor 9:1]

5. and this not merely according to tikvateinu; they gave themselves barishonah to Adoneinu and to us [Moshiach's Shluchim] by the ratzon of Hashem,

6. so that it was necessary for us to urge Titos that as he began and made a haschala (start) before, so he should complete among you also this mitzvah of avodas kodesh of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem.

7. Now just as you abound in everything--in emunah, in torah, in da'as [I Cor. 1:5] and in all zerizut (diligence) and in our ahavah (love) for you--see also that you excel in this Chen v'Chesed Hashem. [I Cor. 16:1-2]

8. I do not lay this out as a mitzvah, but the amittiyyut (sincerity) of your ahavah I am testing against the zerizut of others,

9. for you have da'as of the Chen v'Chesed of Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, who, though being rich, for your sakes, he became poor, [Mt. 8:20; Phil. 2:6-7] that you by Moshiach's aniyyut (poverty) may become rich.

10. And in this I give my etza (advice): it is tov me'od that last shanah you were the first not only to give tzedakah but also to be willing to do so.

11. Now also complete what you started!  Then your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your finishing it from what you have. [Shemot 25:2]

12. For if the readiness is already present, it is acceptable according to whatever one may have--not according to what one does not have. [Mishle 3:27-28; Mk 12:43]

13. For it is not that there should be relief to others and distress and tzoros to you, but that there should be a balance of equality

14. during the present time of your abundance for those who lack, and also for your lack there may be their abundance, [II Cor.9:12] so also there may be equality,

15. as it has been written V'LO HE'DIF HAMARBEH V'HAMAMIT LO HECHESIR. ("The one that gathered the much did not abound and the one that gathered the little did not abound"--SHEMOT 16:18)
 TITOS AND THE PUSHKE OF THE SHE'ARIT FROM THE NATIONS, WHO ARE COLLECTING A SPECIAL TZEDAKAH FUND AND TAKING THE PUSHKE TO ALL THE KEHILLOT IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IN THE GOLUS FOR THE SAKE OF MESSIANIC JEWISH MINISTRY FOR YEHUDIM IN ERETZ YISROEL

16. But Baruch Hashem, the One having given the same zerizut (diligence) for you in the lev (heart) of Titos,

17. because of the chozek (encouragement) he received, and having more zerizut on his own accord, he went forth to you.

18. And we sent with him the Ach b'Moshiach who is bakante (bavuste, famous) among all the kehillot for his proclaiming the Besuras HaGeulah,

19. and not only this but also this Ach b'Moshiach has been hand picked by the Kehillot to travel with us and with this avodas kodesh of chesed being administered by us to the kavod of Adoneinu himself and as an edut (testimony) to your goodwill.

20. Avoiding also that anyone should murmur about our handling of this liberal mattanah (gift);

21. for our tachlis is to do what is tov me'od not only B'EINEI ELOHIM V'ADAM. [Mishle 3:4 Targum Ha-Shivim]

22. And we sent with them our Ach b'Moshiach whom we have often tested and found having zerizut in much, and now having even more zerizut by his great bittachon in you.

23. As for Titos, he is my shutaf and your fellow po'el in your avodas kodesh; as for our Achim b'Moshiach, they are shluchim of the Kehillot, the kavod of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

24. Therefore, openly before the Moshiach's Kehillot, demonstrate your ahavah and vindicate our glorying about you   [II Cor. 7:14].

## 2 Corinthians 9

1. Concerning your Messianic avodas kodesh sherut for the kedoshim [II Cor. 8:4,20] it is superfluous for me to send you this iggeret.

2. For I have da'as of your readiness to involve yourself in Messianic Jewish ministry and this is the subject of my glorying to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been prepared vi-bahlt (since) last shanah and your kanous has been mezarez (a spur into action) to most of them.

3. And I am sending the Achim b'Moshiach lest our glorying on behalf of you should be made empty in this respect, that you be ready, as I was saying you would be,

4. lest perhaps if some Macedonians should come with me and they find you unprepared, we should have bushah, to say nothing of you, in this situation.

5. Therefore, I considered it necessary to encourage the Achim b'Moshiach, that they should go on ahead to you and, having arranged in advance the bountiful terumah (contribution) of the havtacha you made previously so that this mattanah would be ready so as to be a baracha and not an exaction.

6. Note this: the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly,  and the one sowing for a beracha of bounty will also reap a beracha of bounty. [Mishle 11:24,25; 22:9]

7. Each of you should give as he has decided previously in his lev (heart), not giving bedieved (begrudgingly) nor out of necessity; for Hashem loves a cheerful giver. [Shemot 25:2; Devarim 15:10; Mishle 22:8 Targum Ha-Shivim]

8. And Hashem is able to cause to abound to you all Chen v'Chesed Hashem that in everything, always, having all sufficiency, you may abound to every mitzvah.

9. as it has been written, PIZAR NATAN LAEVYONIM TZIDKATO OMEDET LA'AD "He scattered, he gave to the poor, His Righteousness endures forever." [TEHILLIM 112:9 Malachi 3:10]

10. Now the one supplying ZERA (seed) to the sower and LECHEM for ochel (food) [Yeshayah 55:10] will supply and will multiply your zera and will increase the p'ri of the Tzedek [DANIEL 9:25] of you; [Hoshea 10:12 LXX]

11. you will be enriched in everything to all ma'aseh chesed (generosity), which produces through us hodayah (thanksgiving) to Hashem; [II Cor 1:11; 4:15]

12. Because the avodas kodesh of this tzedakah is not only filling up the things lacking of the kedoshim, [II Cor 8:14] but is also abounding through hodayah rabbah (much thanksgiving) to Hashem;

13. through the proof of this Messianic Jewish sherut you bring kavod to Hashem on the basis of your submission to your Ani Ma'amin Hoda'a of the Besuras HaGeulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and on the basis of ma'aseh chesed (generosity) of your terumah (contribution) to them and to all kol bnei Adam;

14. And, reciprocally, the Messianic Jews in Yerushalayim will daven in intercession for you, having great ahavah in Moshiach for you, because of the surpassing Chen v'Chesed Hashem upon you.

15. Baruch Hashem for his indescribable mattanah!

## 2 Corinthians 10

1. Now I myself, Sha'ul, appeal to you gently in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and in his anavah (humility)--I who am peh el peh "lowly" among you [I Cor 2:3] but have "chutzpah" with you when absent [I Cor 2:4; 7:8]

2. --now I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show enough chutzpah to oppose certain persons, [I Cor. 4:21] the ones considering us to act according to the standards of the basar of Olam Hazeh.

3. For though walking in basar, we war not according to the basar,

4. for the weapons of our warfare are not of the basar [Eph. 6:13-17], but full of ko'ach through Hashem to the overthrow of strongholds, overthrowing reasonings [Yirmeyah 1:10; 23:29] BRING EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE FOR TIKKUN (RECTIFICATION) IN MOSHIACH

5. and every high-minded thing rising up against the da'as of Hashem, and leading captive every machashavah (thought) into the mishma'at of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, [Yeshayah 2:11,12]

6. and prepared to discipline all disobedience whenever your mishma'at (obedience) is completed. [II Cor.2:9]
 OYVIM OF THE BESURAS HAGEULAH ATTACK ONE OF HASHEM'S KLEI KODESH (KELI KODESH (MINISTER)S)

7. You look at things according to outward appearance.  If anyone has persuaded himself that he belongs to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, have zikaron of this: as he is of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, so also are we.

8. Now even if I should glory a little too much [II Cor 12:6] in our samchut (authority) [as Shluchim of Moshiach] [II Cor 13:10] which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not suffer bushah. [Yirmeyah 1:10]

9. I did not intend to seem as if my iggrot were meant to frighten you.

10. For they say, "His iggrot indeed are weighty and strong but his physical presence is weak and his shprach, as far as rhetoric is concerned, is despicable."

11. Let such a one consider this: that the dvar we speak through iggrot when absent will become ma'aseh we will very well do when present! [II Cor 13:2,10]

12. For we dare not to make a geder (classification) for ourselves or to compare ourselves with some of the ones commending themselves [II Cor. 3:1;5:12], but when they measure themselves by the standard of one another or compare themselves by with one another, they do not show seichel.

13. But we will not boast out of our depth, but will be shomer to keep within the sadeh (field) Hashem has apportioned to us  [Rom 12:3] which reached out even as far as you. [Gal.2:7-8]

14. For we were not getting out of our depth when we reached even as far as you.  We were the chalutzim who came with th Besuras HaGeulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, EVIL PO'ALIM (WORKERS), FALSE SHLUCHIM, MEN WHO DO NOT  ESTABLISH NEW KEHILLOT, BUT TRY TO STEAL ANOTHER MAN'S WORK, EVEN WHILE THEY ARE BOASTING INAPPROPRIATELY ABOUT ANOTHER MAN'S LABOR AND WICKEDLY INJECTING A RUACH OF GA'AVAH INTO THE BEIS HASHEM

15. We do not boast out of our depth, that is, in the labor of others; but the tikvateinu is that, as your emunah grows, our sphere of Shlichut among you will also be enlarged,

16. so that we may abundantly proclaim the Besuras HaGeulah [Acts 19:21] to the regions beyond you, without boasting in someone else's Messianic chalutz accomplishments.

17. But HAMMIT HALLELYIT HALLEL; ("The one boasting let him boast" in the L-rd.) [Yirmeyah 9:23,24; Tehillim 34:2; 44:8; I Cor.1:13];

18. For it is not the one commending himself that is approved, but it is the one whom [Moshiach] Adoneinu commends. [I Cor. 4:4-5]

## 2 Corinthians 11

1. I would that you might bear with me in a little tipshus (foolery).  Do bear with me!

2. For I have kinah for you a kinat Hashem, for, as a shadhan (marriage-broker), I betrothed you to one ish (husband) to present you as a chaste betulah to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; [Hoshea 2:19; Shir Ha-Shirim; Eph, 5:26-27]

3. but I fear lest somehow as the Nachash deceived Chavah by his cunning [Bereshis 3:1-6,13] your machshavot should be led astray from a simple and pure devekut to Hashem's Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

4. For if someone shows up and preaches another Moshiach, another "Yehoshua," than the one in our drashot, or if you receive a different "Ruach Hakodesh" from the one you received or a different Besuras HaGeulah from the one regarding which you were mekabel, you put up with that well enough. [Gal.1:8-9]

5. For I consider to have come behind the most groise (eminent) shluchim in absolutely nothing. [I Cor 15:10; IICor 12:11; Gal 2:6,9]

6. But if indeed I am unskilled in lashon [I Cor 1:17; 2:1,13] yet I am not in da'as (knowledge) [Eph 3:4] but in all ways and all things I have made this abundantly clear to you.

7. Or--anshuldiks! (pardon!)--did I commit averos by humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I proclaimed Hashem's Besuras HaGeulah to you free of charge? [I Cor. 9:12,18]

8. I robbed other of Moshiach's Kehillot, did I, in taking wages from them for the avodas kodesh work I did for you? [Php 4:15]

9. And when I was present with you and I had lack, I did not burden anyone [II Cor. 12:13], for my lack was made up by the Achim b'Moshiach who came from Macedonia.  So I was shomer not to make myself a buden to you and in that I will remain shomer.

10. As HaEmes of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is in me, that particular boasting of mine will not be silenced [I Cor 9:15] in in the regions of Achaia!

11. Why?  Because I do not have ahavah for you?  Hashem knows that I do!

12. But what I do I will also continue to do in order to deny an opening to those who are looking for an opening by their boasting to be recognized as equals with us.

13. For such ones are shlichei sheker, deceitful po'alim, [Php 3:2],  transforming themselves in a masquerade as shluchim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

14. And no wonder!  For even Hasatan transforms himself into a malach of ohr (light);

15. It is no big megillah, therefore, if also Hasatan's ministers transform themselves as ministers of Tzedek [DANIEL 9:25].  Their end will be according to their ma'asim.

 THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TRUE SHLIACH ENTAIL MORE THAN BEING MERELY FARNUMEN (BUSY) AND FARMAHTERT (EXHAUSTED) FROM THE TZOROS OF THE CARES OF THE KEHILLAH, BUT ENTAIL ALL KINDS OF MESSIANIC SUFFERING; THE SAKANA (RISK, HAZARD) OF RAV SHA'UL'S AVODAS KODESH SERVICE TO MOSHIACH

16. Listen here, let no one think me a tipesh (idiot).  But if you do think me a yold (fool), then receive me as a yold that I, too, may boast ki hu zeh (a small amount). [II Cor 12:6]

17. What I speak in this bittachon of boasting, I speak not according to Moshiach Adoneinu, but as a yold.

18. Als (since) many boast according to the basar, I also will boast.

19. For magnanimously you put up with fools, being such talmidei chachomim yourselves!

20. For you put up with it quite well, if anyone trades you into slavery, if anyon turns you into their supper, if anyone lifts your wallet, if anyone exalts himself into your macher, if anyone gives you a klop in the ponem.

21. To my bushah, I say that we were too weak for that!  But, nevertheless, in whatever way anyone may have chutzpah in foolishness, I also will speak with chutzpah.

22. Are they Ivrim?  So am I.  Are they Yisre'elim?  So am I.  Are they Zera Avraham?  So am I. [Php 3:5]

23. Are they mesharetei HaRebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?  (I am talking like someone who is meshuga.) [I Cor 15:10] I can outdo them:  in labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more frequently, in beatings more by far, and often near death.

24. By Yehudim chamash p'amim I had the arba'im lashes minus one! [Devarim 25:3]

25. Shloshah p'amim I was beaten with rods, [Act 16:10] pa'am achat I was stoned [Act 14:19], shloshah p'amim I was shipwrecked, spending a lailah and a yom in the open sea;

26. in journeys often,  Pikuach nefesh (imminent danger) from rivers, pikuach nefesh from robbers, pikuach nefesh from my own people [Act 9:23], pikuach nefesh from Goyim [Act 14:5], pikuach nefesh in the city, pikuach nefesh in the country, pikuach nefesh in the sea, pikuach nefesh among achei sheker;

27. in labor and toil, in watchings, often in famine and thirst, in tzomot often, in cold and nakedness; [II Cor 6:5];

28. beside the things from without, there is the pressure on me yom yom, the care of all of Moshiach's Kehillot.

29. Who is weak and I am not weak? [I Cor 9:22]  Who is caused to fall into chet (sin), and I do not burn?

30. If it is necessary for me to boast, then I will boast of my weaknesses. [II Cor 12:5]

31. Hashem, Elohim HaAv of Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua knows (Hamevorach l'olmei olamim!) that I am not speaking sheker. [II Cor 1:23]

32. In Damascus the Ethnarch under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus to arrest me,

33. and I was let down through the wall through a window in a basket, and escaped his hands. [Act 9:24-25]

## 2 Corinthians 12

1. It is necessary for me to boast, nothing gained by it, yet I now come to marot and chazonot of Adoneinu.

2. I have da'as of a man in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arba esreh shanah before, whether in or out of the guf (body) I do not have da'as, Hashem knows, such a man was snatched up and raptured to th raki'a haShlishi of Shomayim.

3. And I have da'as that such a man, whether in or out of the guf (body) I do not have da'as, Hashem knows,

4. that he was caught away into Gan-Eden and heard inexpressible dvarim for which bnei Adam to utter there is no heter (permit).

5. On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. [II Cor 11:30]

6. But if I desire to boast, I will not be a yold (fool)      [II Cor 10:8; 11:16] for I will speak HaEmes; but I spare you, lest anyone gives me credit beyond what he sees in me or hears in me.

7. Therefore, lest I should be too exalted especially by the excess of my chazonot (revelations, visions), there was given to me a kotz (thorn, splinter) in my basar, a malach of Hasatan, for the purpose of using his fists on me [Iyov 2:6], lest I should be too exalted. [Bamidbar 33:55]

8. I davened shalosh p'amim, calling upon Adoneinu that it might depart from me.

9. And HaAdon said to me, "My Chesed is ad kahn (sufficient for the purpose, enough) for you, for my ko'ach is perfected in weakness." With lev samei'ach therefore will I boast in my weaknesses that the gevurah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach might be a shelter over me. [Melachim Alef 19:12]

10. Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, and tzoros on behalf of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; for whenever I am weak, then the gibbor (strong man) am I! [Php 4:11,13]  A SHLIACH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS CONCERN FOR THE KEHILLAH HE FOUNDED: ANSWERING OBJECTIONS

11. I have been a yold!  You forced me.  For I ought to be commended by you, for in nothing I was behind the most groise (eminent) shluchim [II Cor 11:5], even if I am nothing.

12. Indeed the signs of the Shliach of Moshiach were brought about among you in all savlanut, both by otot and moftim and gevurot. [Rom 15:19]

13. For in what have you been short-changed compared to the rest of Moshiach's Kehillot, except that I myself was not a burden on you?  [II Cor 11:9]  Do pardon me this slight!

14. Hinei, this is the pa'am shlishit I am ready to come to you [II Cor 13:1], and I will not be a burden; for I seek not yours but you, for yeladim ought not to lay up for their horim (parents), but horim for their yeladim. [Mishle 19:14]

15. But with simcha I will expend and be utterly expended for the nefashot (souls) [Php 2:17].  If more abundantly I have ahavah for you, are you to have less ahavah for me?

16. But let the matter of my being a burden on you be as it may, some say, "Crafty jack that I am, I took you by ormah (cunning)" [Bereshis 3:1]

17. Now I didn't take advantage of any of you through anyone I sent to you, did I?

18. I urged Titos to go, and I sent with him the Ach b'Moshiach; [II Cor 8:6, 16-18] Titos didn't take advantage of you, did he? Did we not walk our derech by the same Ruach Hakodesh?  We did not march out of step, did Titos and I?
 THE SHLIACH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE KEHILLAH

19. All along have you been thinking that we are making a hitstaddekut (defense) before you?  No, before Hashem in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach we speak!  Everything we do, Chaverim, is for the sake of your upbuilding and edification!

20. For I fear lest efsher (perhaps) when I come I may not find you as I wish [II Cor. 2:1-4] and that you may not find me as you wish; I fear lest efsher there be merivah, kinah, ka'as, machalokot, lashon hora, conceit, commotions;

21. lest when I come again Hashem Elohai may make me anav (humble) before you, and I should have agmat nefesh over many of the ones who committed averos before [II Cor 13:2], and have not made teshuva from the tumah (uncleanness) and zenut (fornication) and debauchery which they practiced.

## 2 Corinthians 13

1. This is the pa'am hashlishit I am coming to you; [II Cor 12:14] by the PI SHNAYIM SHLOSHAH EDIM (`by the mouth of two or three witnesses,`DEVARIM 19:15) every dvar shall be established.

2. I warned those who committed averos before and all the rest, and now absent I warn them again, as I did when I made pakod (visit) the pa'am hasheinit, that if I come again, I will not spare, I will not be lenient,

3. als (since) you seek to test if Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is speaking in me.  Moshiach is not weak toward you, but is GIBBOR in you [Yeshayah 9:5].

4. For indeed he was pierced on the Aitz out of weakness, [Phil. 2:7-8] but Moshiach lives by the gevurat Hashem.  Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by the gevurat Hashem we will live with him to serve you.

5. Perform a bedikah (examination) on yourselves to see if you are in the [Orthodox Jewish] emunah (faith).  Test and prove yourselves [I Cor 11:28].  Or do you yourselves not have da'as that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is in you?  Unless you are reprobate and unapproved. [Ekhah 3:40]

6. But I have tikvah that you will have da'as that we are not unapproved.

7. Now we daven (pray) to Hashem that you do not do any rah, not that we Shluchim may appear to have stood the test, but that you may do HaTov, though we may seem to have failed.
